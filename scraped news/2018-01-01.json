          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s movie box office revenue rose 13.45 percent last year to 55.91 billion yuan ($8.59 billion), more than tripling the 2016 growth rate as foreign films won a larger share of ticket sales compared to the previous year, said the Xinhua News Agency.  Domestic films recorded ticket sales of 30.1 billion yuan in 2017, accounting for 54 percent of total box office, Xinhua reported on Sunday, citing data from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television. Domestic films in 2016 accounted for 58 percent of total box office.  China is the second-largest movie market globally after the United States, though it already has more total movie screens after years of rapid expansion in theater networks.   China added 9,597 screens last year to reach 50,776 in total, the media regulator said. That compares to just over 40,000 screens in the United States, according to data from U.S.-based National Association of Theatre Owners.   The movie \u201cWolf Warrior 2\u201d was China\u2019s highest-grossing film last year, raking in 5.68 billion yuan in ticket sales.  After disappointing box office growth in 2016, regulators announced that all sales grosses would include service fees for each ticket purchased online. This boosted last year\u2019s growth, although moviemakers see little of the additional revenue.   Reporting by Elias Glenn; Editing by Michael Perry"

          "title": "Italian president calls for 'realistic' proposals ahead of election",
          "body": "ROME (Reuters) - President Sergio Mattarella on Sunday urged political parties to make realistic proposals to tackle Italy\u2019s problems, especially joblessness, ahead of an election in March.  Although the presidency is largely ceremonial, Mattarella does have the power to pick prime ministers and dissolve parliament, which he did this week to open the way for a March 4 election.  \u201cThe duty to make adequate proposals - realistic and concrete ones - is a must given the dimension of the problems our country faces,\u201d Mattarella said during a traditional end-year speech broadcast live on national television.  \u201cYet again I must underscore that jobs remain the primary and most serious social issue, especially for the young,\u201d he added in his unusually brief 10-minute address.  Italy\u2019s economy, the euro zone\u2019s third-biggest, probably grew this year at its fastest rate since 2010, but remains among the most sluggish in Europe. Unemployment remains above 11 percent, while youth joblessness is about 35 percent.  Though Italy has the largest public debt in the euro zone after Greece\u2019s, all the main political forces are pledging to raise the budget deficit if they win the election, with policies ranging from the expansive to the outlandish.  Italy was at the heart of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011, and the impending vote is seen the next source of potential instability in the currency bloc.  The premium that investors demand to hold Italian rather than German 10-year government bonds reached its widest since Oct. 23 on Friday, a day after Mattarella dissolved parliament.  The ruling Democratic Party (PD) is promising up to 50 billion euros ($60 billion) in tax cuts, while the center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) wants to bring back the lira for domestic use alongside the euro and introduce a flat income tax.  The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement has floated the idea of holding a referendum on Italy\u2019s euro membership if the European Union refuses to renegotiate its stringent fiscal rules.  Opinion polls now suggest no one will win a parliamentary majority, which may force Mattarella to intervene to try to break a political deadlock.  A center-right alliance built around Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia looks set to take the largest number of seats, according to the most recent polls, but is likely to come up short of a majority in both houses.  Polls suggest Forza Italia will get around 16 percent and its partners, the right-wing Northern League and Brothers of Italy, 14 and 5 percent respectively.  Five-Star Movement leads opinion polls with more than 27 percent of the vote, followed by the PD on around 24 percent.  ($1 = 0.8331 euros)  Reporting by Steve Scherer; Editing by Kevin Liffey"

USC outscored the Cougars 17-2 to take a 69-46 lead midway through the second half.  The Cougars didn\u2019t threaten the rest of the way.  Nick Rakocevic came off the bench and scored 12 points on 6-of-7 shooting as six Trojans reached double figures in scoring. He added nine rebounds.

The Trojans made 5 of 9 shots to start the game and jumped out to a 17-4 lead.  The Cougars were 1 of 9 \u2014 including 1 of 7 from beyond the arc \u2014 over the game\u2019s first seven-plus minutes.  Skaggs hit a 3-pointer to cut the USC lead to 19-12 midway through the first half.  The Cougars play just once in the next 11 days, when they host Washington on Saturday.  After nine consecutive home games, the Trojans take to the road for meetings with California and Stanford next weekend."

          "title": "Two head coaches gone as Raiders fire Del Rio, Colts dump Pagano",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Jack Del Rio was close to tears as he revealed he had been fired as head coach by the Oakland Raiders on Sunday, shortly after the National Football League (NFL) team completed their final game of the season.  Del Rio\u2019s departure came just three hours after the Indianapolis Colts said they also had sacked their head coach Chuck Pagano.  The 57-year-old Pagano, who had been in charge of Indianapolis for six seasons, was widely expected to be sacked after the Colts posted a 4-12 record that ended with a 22-13 win over the Houston Texans.  But Del Rio\u2019s sacking after three seasons was less predictable, coming less than a year after he signed a four-year contract extension following a successful 2016, when the Raiders went 12-4 and finally made the playoffs after a 13-season drought.  But the team regressed in 2017, going 6-10.  An emotional Del Rio, 54, said it had been a dream to coach his \u201cchildhood team\u201d but he acknowledged the reality of the business.  \u201cIt\u2019s a results business, I understand,\u201d he told a press conference, his voice cracking.  Del Rio went 25-24 in his three seasons with the Raiders.  Local media reported that former Raiders coach Jon Gruden was likely to replace Del Rio.  Gruden coached the Raiders from 1998-2001, before guiding the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to victory in the 2002 season Super Bowl. He most recently has been working as a television analyst.  The Colts, meanwhile, thanked Pagano for his body of work, while at the same time showing him the door.  \u201cChuck\u2019s first season was one of the more inspirational stories in NFL history as he courageously battled and overcame leukemia,\u201d Colts Owner & CEO Jim Irsay said in a statement.  Pagano, speaking before his firing had been announced, said: \u201cI\u2019m just grateful I\u2019m on this side of the dirt,\u201d referring to his recovery from leukemia.  Pagano guided the Colts to a 56-46 overall record (including the post-season) after joining the team in 2012.  He led them to three consecutive 11-5 seasons and playoff appearances from 2012-14, which included the 2014 AFC Championship game.  But the team failed to compile a winning record the past three seasons as they were hampered by multiple injuries to quarterback Andrew Luck.  Del Rio and Pagano are likely to be joined by several other sacked head coaches over the next couple of days.  Ben McAdoo of the New York Giants was the only head coach fired during the season.

Noah Dickerson scored 14 points to lead Washington (11-4, 1-1). The Huskies shot 27.9 percent for the game and 17.1 percent in the second half.  The Huskies\u2019 lead bounced between eight and 13 points for much of the first half, and Washington had a 36-28 advantage at the break despite making just 2 of 12 from long range to start the game.  Washington jumped out to an early 14-6 lead as UCLA made just one field goal over the first five minutes.  The Huskies dominated on the boards early as they led 21-9 at the second media timeout.  Washington had more offensive rebounds (six) than the Bruins had total rebounds (three) over the first eight minutes.  UCLA hits the road for the first time in almost a month to face Stanford and California next weekend.  The Huskies play just once, Saturday at Washington State, over the next 11 days."

          "body": "AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan\u2019s royal palace warned it would take legal measures against anyone spreading what it said were lies about the ruling family, just days after King Abdullah relieved his brothers from top army posts in a major shakeup.  The king, a staunch U.S. ally, said on Tuesday that his  brothers Prince Ali and Prince Faisal and his cousin Prince Talal - who all had high military ranks - would be retiring from the armed forces.  He said the move was part of a reorganization of the armed forces\u2019 hierarchy and structure.  Prince Faisal was head of the royal air force and deputy chief of staff, while Prince Ali had for years been in charge of the royal guards responsible for the king\u2019s protection.  Talal Bin Mohammad, a Sandhurst graduate who was and an officer in the elite special forces, was also sent into retirement. They were all given honorary promotions.  A palace statement on Sunday said it would pursue legal measures against those who propagated \u201clies and false claims\u201d in social media and online websites with the goal of driving a wedge between the royal family and ordinary Jordanians.  \u201cThese fabricated news circulated recently are aimed at undermining Jordan and its institutions,\u201d the statement said.  A Jordanian army source said the move by the king was prompted by a desire to set an example that the Hashemite ruling family was not above the law ahead of an anticipated move to retire dozens of senior army generals.  The king, who himself is an elite special forces commander, said the restructuring plan aimed to reorganize the 120,000- strong army by cutting costs and creating a more lean and effective force better equipped to modern warfare against terrorist groups.   The kingdom, which borders both Iraq to the east and Syria to the north and Israel to the west, has escaped relatively unscathed from the regional turmoil around it.  Many of the top army brass are drawn from native Jordanian  tribes who form the backbone of the support for the royal family and play a dominant role in the army and government.   Jordanians see the royal family as a unifying force that holds together a country where many of its citizens are Palestinians whose families settled after successive Arab-Israeli wars, placing the kingdom at the heart of the conflict.

          "body": "DALLAS \u2014 Tyler Pitlick had two goals and Ben Bishop stopped all 26 shots he faced for the Dallas Stars in a 6-0 win against the San Jose Sharks on Sunday night at American Airlines Center.  John Klingberg, Stephen Johns, Tyler Seguin and Devin Shore also scored for Dallas (22-15-3). The Stars got three assists from Radek Faksa and two apiece from Mattias Janmark and Jamie Benn.  Bishop earned his 23rd career shutout and fourth of the season.  San Jose (20-12-4) was shut out for the second time this season.  Dallas led 2-0 after one period and 4-0 after two. The Stars are now 14-4-1 at home.  Klingberg opened the Stars\u2019 barrage with his fifth goal of the season 6:19 into the game. He beat Martin Jones far post on a one-timer from the right circle.  Pitlick then gave Dallas a two-goal lead when he scored with 4:53 remaining in the opening frame. Pitlick beat Jones top shelf and to his short side on his flick from the slot.  Johns made it 3-0 with his fourth goal of the season 4:25 into the second period when he scored from the high slot during a four-on-four situation.  Seguin added a power-play goal when he redirected a Klingberg wrist shot for his 19th goal of the season at 9:33 of the second. Seguin knocked Klingberg\u2019s wrister into the top of the San Jose net.  Dallas now has a power-play goal in its last six games.  The Stars lost two players to injury in the second period. At 7:04 into the middle frame, Alexander Radulov went hard into the boards while battling Justin Braun. Radulov left the ice on his own, but after sitting on the Dallas bench for several minutes, retired to the dressing room.  Radulov had an upper-body injury and did not return.  With 2:08 remaining in the second, Dan Hamhuis caught a stick to the face and left the ice, but he returned early in the third.  Aaron Dell replaced Jones, who stopped 18 of 22 shots, in net for the Sharks to start the third period. Dell stopped eight of 10 shots in relief.  Shore and Pitlick scored 50 seconds apart in the third. With 8:05 remaining, Pitlick knocked in a backhand off a rebound, clinching his third two-goal game this season. He has seven goals on the season.  NOTES: The Sharks scratched RW Jannik Hansen, D Tim Heed and D Paul Martin. ... The Stars scratched C Jason Dickinson and C Martin Hanzal (lower body). ...

          "body": "Butker\u2019s FG gives Chiefs fifth win in a row over Broncos, 27-24  DENVER \u2014 The Kansas City Chiefs got what they could out of a regular-season finale that they had rendered meaningless by locking up their playoff position the week before.  Rookie quarterback Patrick Mahomes led four scoring drives, the last leading to Harrison Butker\u2019s decisive field goal with no time left, and the playoff-bound Chiefs rested key starters and pulled out a 27-24 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday.  \u201cWe\u2019re keeping it rolling,\u201d said running back Kareem Hunt, whose lone carry resulted in a Chiefs touchdown. \u201cWinning is the only thing for right now. That\u2019s all we need to do right now is keep winning and keep advancing.\u201d  Mahomes, in his first career NFL action, completed 22-of-35 passes for 284 yards with an interception. Linebacker Ramik Wilson returned a fumble 11 yards for a score, Kareem Hunt ran 35 yards for a touchdown, and fullback Anthony Sherman ran 1 yard for a score. Butker added a pair of field goals, including a 30-yarder for the game-winner to help the Chiefs (10-6) beat Denver (5-11) for the fifth straight time.  \u201cIt was a tough game,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cThey spotted some people. We spotted some people. The guys that played on both sides, I think, did a heck of a job. My hat goes off for my guys for how they battled.\u201d  Both sides showcased their younger players in the finale, though for very different reasons. The Chiefs clinched their second straight AFC West title with last week\u2019s 29-13 win over the Miami Dolphins, locking Kansas City in as the No. 4 playoff seed in the conference. They will host a playoff game next Saturday against Tennessee.  \u201cBeing in the game and having the opportunity to play with these guys was awesome,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I will have to build on going into the playoffs and into the offseason.\u201d  The Broncos, going nowhere after a season that included an eight-game losing streak that stood out as their longest in 50 years, took advantage of a chance to see what they have in some of their younger players. That included quarterback Paxton Lynch, who came back from an ankle injury to make his second start of the season, completing 21-of-31 passes for 254 yards with two touchdowns, two interceptions and a fumble. The Chiefs scored 10 points off the turnovers.  \u201cTurnovers obviously hurt us, but at the end of the day, you have to turn around and keep playing,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of myself and this group on how we continued to battle against adversity tonight.\u201d  Mahomes was relieved by Tyler Bray midway through the fourth quarter and his first play resulted in a bad exchange to Sherman that was fumbled away. Linebacker Zaire Anderson swooped in to pick up the loose ball and returned it 38 yards for a touchdown, pulling the Broncos to within seven points with 7:02 left.  Denver evened the score 24-24 with 2:53 remaining when Lynch completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas on fourth down. Cornerback Terrance Mitchell slipped and fell on the play, leaving Thomas wide open.  Mahomes returned to the field to lead the next drive, ending in Butker\u2019s game-winner.  \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get it done a lot of times this year in all phases,\u201d Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall said. \u201cIt was just kind of sad. It is not like us.\u201d  Reid decided to rest quarterback Alex Smith, averting the risk of injury to his starter while giving Mahomes, who hadn\u2019t taken a snap in a game prior to Sunday\u2019s finale, some practical experience ahead of the playoffs.  Among the fellow starters joining Smith on the sideline were tight end Travis Kelce, wide receiver Tyreek Hill and cornerback Marcus Peters, who were among the team\u2019s inactive players.  Leading by four at the half, the Chiefs stretched their lead to 24-10, highlighted by Wilson\u2019s scoop-and-score after defensive end Chris Jones sacked Lynch, forcing a fumble.  Mahomes also led an 18-play, 90-yard drive ending in Butker\u2019s 20-yard field goal with 3:58 remaining in the third quarter.  Hunt, the NFL\u2019s rushing leader, did not return after his only carry resulted in a 35-yard touchdown run in the first quarter that put Kansas City up early. That enavbled him to pass Rams running back Todd Gurley II to become the NFL\u2019s elading rusher with 1,327 yards.  The Chiefs took a 14-10 halftime lead on Sherman\u2019s 1-yard scoring run with 1:07 remaining in the second quarter. Initially, it was believed Mahomes had scrambled for a 6-yard touchdown, but the play was overruled on replay review when it was determined that the Chiefs rookie had stepped out of bounds just shy of the goal line.  Denver got a 36-yard field goal from Brandon McManus and Lynch went 5-for-5 for 65 yards on a subsequent touchdown drive that running back De\u2019Angelo Henderson finished with a 29-yard score off a screen pass.  NOTES: Chiefs S Leon McQuay left the game in the first quarter to be evaluated for a concussion. ... Former All-Pro T Ryan Clady, who was signed for one day last week so he would retire as a Bronco, was honored in a pregame tribute. \u201cI played most of my career here and I loved it while I was here and had great success here,\u201d Clady said. \u201cIt meant a lot.\u201d ... Chiefs PR De\u2019Anthony Thomas was carted off the field with a right leg injury after being pulled to the ground awkwardly at the end of the return. Thomas, who was injured on the final play of the first quarter, did not return. ... Broncos RB Jamal Charles, a former Chief who complained last week about his limited role, was among Denver\u2019s inactive players. ... Chiefs P Dustin Colquitt got off a 77-yard punt to end the second quarter."

Looks can be deceiving.  Evans is enjoying a revival at age 28, and he helped the Memphis Grizzlies leave the Kings in the dust on Sunday. The veteran guard, in his ninth season, scored a game-high 26 points in 26 minutes as Memphis won 114-96 at the Golden 1 Center.  \u201cHe\u2019s on a mission right now,\u201d Grizzlies interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a personal mission, which is the best part about it. He\u2019s unselfish in what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s helping our team in a multitude of ways. He knows we need him to score the ball, but if you look at some of the passes he made today and in other games, you know he\u2019s playing for the team.\u201d  Evans canned 10 of 16 shots from the field and made 5 of 7 3-point attempts. He added five assists and six rebounds before sitting out the fourth quarter.  Jarell Martin scored 11 points, and no other Memphis player scored more than 10 in the Grizzlies\u2019 third victory in five games. Memphis (12-25) had lost 19 of its previous 21 before that five-game stretch.  In those five games, Evans is averaging 27.0 points on 51.6 percent shooting. He looks nothing like the player who averaged 11.6 points in 14 contests with Sacramento last season during his second stint with the club that drafted him with the fourth overall pick in 2009.  \u201cI feel good,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the summer, I got into the best shape of my life. I wanted to prove to everyone that I can still play.\u201d  Against Sacramento, Evans helped Memphis top the 100-point mark for the third consecutive game. The Grizzlies passed that marker in only three of their previous 12 games before that stretch.  \u201cIf you take a look at our last five games, our scoring is up, our field-goal percentage is up, and our assists are up,\u201d Bickerstaff said.  The Grizzlies again played without guard Mike Conley, out since Nov. 13 because a left heel injury. Forward Chandler Parsons also sat out against Sacramento because of a sore right knee.  Willie Cauley-Stein scored 21 points and pulled down eight rebounds to pace Sacramento (12-24), but the Kings lost for the second straight time and for the fourth time in five contests.  \u201cTough night,\u201d Kings coach Dave Joerger said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we just exhaled from being at home or relaxed after being on the road. But that was not a good performance.\u201d  Buddy Hield scored 15 points, and Garrett Temple added 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting for the Kings. However, center Zach Randolph scored only four points on 2-of-7 shooting in his first game against the team for which he played eight seasons.  The Kings are 1-2 halfway through a six-game homestand that will match their longest of the season.  Sacramento rookie guard Frank Mason didn\u2019t return after landing awkwardly and bruising his right heel while trying to rebound a missed free throw at the first-quarter buzzer. Mason made two free throws and missed a third when he was awarded the foul shots after a lengthy review following a missed half-court shot at the first-quarter buzzer.  NOTES: Memphis G Mike Conley is traveling with the team and has taken part in practices, as well as a pregame workout before Saturday\u2019s contest at Golden State, the Memphis Commercial-Appeal reported. Conley has missed 24 straight games with a left heel injury. ... Kings G De\u2019Aaron Fox, initially listed as doubtful for Sunday\u2019s game, missed his sixth straight contest with a partial tear of his right quadriceps muscle. Sacramento has not said when he will return. The Kings finished the game without both of their rookie point guards after Frank Mason injured his left heel at the end of the first quarter. ... Grizzlies C Marc Gasol, who scored seven points in 24 minutes, on his first match-up against former teammate Zach Randolph: \u201cSo many things go through your head, so many emotions. He\u2019s a brother to me.\u201d ... Kings F Skal Labiessiere, who scored 12 points in a start against Phoenix on Friday after sitting out three straight games, returned to the bench and scored six points with one rebound in 17 minutes."

          "body": "Williams, Griffin guide Clippers past Hornets  LOS ANGELES \u2014 Lou Williams\u2019 40 points in a 106-98 Clippers win on Sunday at Staples Center came in a variety of ways \u2014 none of which the Charlotte Hornets could solve.  \u201cHe was just a nightmare tonight,\u201d Charlotte forward Frank Kaminsky said. \u201cHe started hitting [3-pointers] early, so we start getting up on his screen. He starts driving to the rim, and then he\u2019s getting fouled.\u201d  Williams and forward Blake Griffin \u2014 in his second game back from a sprained knee \u2014 were the only Clippers to score in double figures. That was all Los Angeles needed, however.  Initial reports when Griffin went down Nov. 28 projected the forward to be sidelined for two months, but after scoring 24 points in his return Friday against the Los Angeles Lakers, he looked sharp again.  Griffin finished with 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists \u2014 much of which came in the pivotal third quarter.  Griffin came alive in a period the Clippers dominated 33-14, regaining control following a dismal second quarter.  The Hornets (13-23) held the Clippers to just 13 second-quarter points, at one point erupting for a 28-7 run that put Charlotte ahead by 14. That marked the Hornets\u2019 largest lead before Los Angeles began chipping away.  The Clippers led through the first quarter behind Williams, who recorded 16 points in the opening 12 minutes. Williams also dished out eight assists in the game.  His key contribution may have come off the floor at halftime, however.  \u201cHe let the second unit have it at halftime,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cWilliams came off the bench with Los Angeles\u2019 second string, with Jawun Evans getting the start. \u201cI stood out (of the locker room) and waited for him to be finished.\u201d  Williams\u2019 teammates received his message.  Kemba Walker paced the Hornets, scoring both attacking the rim off the dribble and connecting on four 3-pointers. He scored 20 of his 30 points in the first half and knocked down a pair from behind the arc late in the fourth quarter as Charlotte tried to mount a comeback.  Kaminsky and Johnny O\u2019Bryant, as well as guard Jeremy Lamb all came off the Charlotte bench to chip in a combined 38 points, led by Kaminsky\u2019s 16.  \u201cThe first time we came in, we had the energy we needed to come back,\u201d said Charlotte wing Treveon Graham, who chipped in another nine points off the bench. \u201cBut the second half was up and down.\u201d  \u201cIf we want to win the game, we have to play all 48 minutes,\u201d he said.  The Hornets\u2019 inconsistency was evident in the play of the starters. Walker was the only one to finish in double figures scoring. Center Dwight Howard recorded more turnovers (five) than points (four) and did not make a field goal until the middle of the third quarter.  Charlotte remained in striking distance throughout the fourth quarter but never cut the deficit below four points.  \u201cWe came out flat,\u201d Kaminsky said of the third quarter. \u201cThey ramped up the defense, and we didn\u2019t have an answer..It was tough to get back over that hump.\u201d  Though no Clippers beyond Griffin and Williams scored in double figures, center DeAndre Jordan contributed eight points and 16 rebounds. Guard Milos Teodosic also scored eight points, including a key 3-pointer in the late fourth quarter, and dished five assists.  The win came down to Griffin and Williams, however, right to the finish. They each responded to Walker\u2019s late 3-pointers, first with Williams putting in a tough, hanging layup to increase the lead to seven, then Griffin knocking down a pair of free throws to push the edge to six, effectively putting the game away.  \u201cThe struggle in the first half was self-inflicted,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe second group didn\u2019t come in ready to play, and I was a part of that. Once we cleaned it up at halftime, we were in position to win the game.\u201d  NOTES: The Hornets shot 38.7 percent, finishing below 40 percent from the floor for the third time in four games. ... Clippers F C.J. Williams finished with a team-best plus-minus rating of plus-24. He scored four points, grabbed a rebound, passed an assist and forced two steals in 34 minutes. ... Clippers G Lou Williams shot 10 of 11 from the free-throw line to pace Los Angeles on a 24-of-27 afternoon. The Hornets were 15 of 19 on foul shots."

          "title": "Smith, Mavs slip past Westbrook, Thunder",
          "body": "Smith, Mavs slip past Westbrook, Thunder  OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 With about five minutes to go in the Sunday game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Dallas Mavericks rookie point guard Dennis Smith Jr. reached a realization after a slow start.  These situations \u2014 tight games in the fourth quarter \u2014 were where he needed to come through.  Smith was quiet for much of the game as the Thunder put him under extreme pressure. However, he finished big, scoring 11 points in the final 1:39 to lift Dallas to a 116-113 win at Chesapeake Energy Arena.  \u201cIt was time for me to get it going,\u201d Smith said.  Smith\u2019s growth has been a continuing storyline for the Mavericks (13-25) throughout their current four-game winning streak, especially over the past two.  He didn\u2019t get close to a triple-double after a game after becoming the third-youngest player in league history to accomplish that statistical feat, but Smith lifted his team at the end.  Smith finished with 19 points, four rebounds and six assists.  \u201cHe was great tonight,\u201d Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cIt was an up-and-down night, there was a lot going on. They were trapping him in the pick-and-rolls. He hasn\u2019t seen that. He went through some situations that were very difficult, but he kept his energy up, he kept his head up, he kept attacking.\u201d  Just so much growth.  And Smith did it against one of the league\u2019s preeminent point guards.  Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook turned in another huge night \u2014 38 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists \u2014 but couldn\u2019t match Smith in the end as the Thunder dropped their second consecutive game.  In the final two minutes, the point guards took over.  Moments after Jerami Grant put the Thunder ahead with 1:52 remaining, Smith calmly sank a 3-pointer to put the Mavericks ahead 108-106.  Westbrook responded with a layup to tie it before Smith hit another 3-pointer.  In the final minute, with Dallas holding a one-point lead, Smith drove hard to the rim and finished with a layup to extend the margin.  Smith added a pair of free throws, but it was a missed free throw that gave the Thunder hope.  Westbrook grabbed the rebound off the miss and barreled up the court with a head of steam. Westbrook\u2019s 3-point try clanged off the rim, but the ball bounced out of bounds off a Mavericks player to give Oklahoma City one more chance with 3.6 seconds to play.  Westbrook\u2019s ensuing 3-point attempt missed the mark, too, dropping the Thunder to 20-17.  \u201cWe just didn\u2019t get the stops we needed to,\u201d Westbrook said.  Up until the final flurry, Westbrook had been excellent in the fourth quarter, going 7 of 9 from the floor, all from inside the arc, before missing the first of three 3-pointers with 20.9 seconds left.  Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 24 points in what Carlisle called the best game of his season. Barnes was 10 of 15 from the floor and 4 of 6 from behind the 3-point arc. Dirk Nowitzki scored 13, and J.J. Barea added 12 points and 11 assists for Dallas.  Paul George scored 25 for the Thunder (20-17), and Carmelo Anthony added 21.  The Mavericks shot 51.7 percent from the floor overall. They scored 35 first-quarter points and 32 in the final quarter.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to get back to our identity, which has been really an elite defensive team for really most of the year,\u201d Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. \u201cYou can see as games have gone here the last week or so, there\u2019s been slippage, and we\u2019ve got to get back to that.  \u201cWe\u2019re doing some good things on offense, but I feel like defensively, we\u2019ve got to get back to that being our staple and continue to grow offensively.\u201d  NOTES: The Thunder\u2019s Josh Huestis made his first career start, playing at guard with Andre Roberson out with left patellar tendinitis. Huestis was scoreless and grabbed six rebounds in 19 minutes. ... Mavericks PF Josh McRoberts was active for the first time this season as he progresses from a series of injuries that have kept him out after joining Dallas in the offseason. McRoberts did not play. ... Thunder PF Patrick Patterson was fined $10,000 for a tweet criticizing officials following Oklahoma City\u2019s Friday loss to Milwaukee. Patterson\u2019s tweet came in response to the NBA\u2019s report that the Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo stepped out of bounds just before slamming home his game-winning dunk. ... Dallas outshot Oklahoma City 51.7 percent to 48.3 percent to improve to 12-3 this season when outshooting its opponent."

          "body": "Titans hold on to earn first postseason berth since 2008  NASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Tennessee Titans outside linebacker Derrick Morgan played in his 105th career game Sunday.  Next weekend, he will suit up for his first career playoff game.  Morgan and the Tennessee defense came up big in the franchise\u2019s biggest game in years, wrapping up the Titans\u2019 first playoff berth since 2008 in a 15-10 verdict over the AFC South champion Jacksonville Jaguars.  When Kevin Byard notched his second interception of Blake Bortles with 10 seconds left to seal the outcome, the remainder of the crowd of 65,501 at Nissan Stadium erupted, chanting \u201cplayoffs, playoffs.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here through a lot of 2-14s, 6-10s, so to be here and finally play a meaningful game in Week 17 and win it, it\u2019s great, man.\u201d  The Titans (9-7) are the fifth seed and will travel to Kansas City, Mo., to play the AFC West champion Chiefs Saturday for their playoff opener. Jacksonville (10-6) will host Buffalo, the AFC\u2019s other wild-card team, after the Bills\u2019 22-16 win in Miami Sunday and Baltimore\u2019s stunning 31-27 loss at home to Cincinnati.  Tennessee\u2019s offense managed only 232 yards and 11 first downs, but its defense protected the lead fiercely in ending a three-game losing streak. The Titans had blown fourth-quarter leads in each game, putting them on the brink of elimination.  This time, there was no letup from the Tennessee defense, even after the Jaguars crawled back into the game on a major gaffe from its offense. Angling to land a kill shot, the Titans instead fumbled the ball at the Jacksonville 33 on a botched exchange between quarterback Marcus Mariota and running back Derrick Henry.  Jaguars defensive end Yannick Ngakoue recovered it and ran 67 yards for a touchdown with 10:48 left in the game, cutting what seemed like a comfortable lead to five points. The doubt seemed to radiate through fans, who didn\u2019t have any reason to feel good, either because of the frigid weather or because of the recent form chart.  But Tennessee players weren\u2019t dwelling on the past.  \u201cWe were just focusing on what we had to do,\u201d defensive tackle Karl Klug said.  Which meant defend and bleed clock. The Jaguars created only one first down on their last three possessions. Linebacker Brian Orakpo bagged a critical sack of Bortles to help force a punt, and Bortles forced a couple of other throws with the pass rush bearing down on him.  Offensively, the Titans melted all but 18 seconds on a drive that started with 3:57 left. Mariota, who hasn\u2019t run much in the last three games due to a leg injury suffered on Dec. 10 in Arizona, moved the chains with scampers of 7 and 13 yards.  \u201cThey covered it well,\u201d he said of the second third-down run. \u201cI wanted to make a play for the guys and I was able to do it. It\u2019s more instinctual ... I was just trying to make a play.\u201d  Mariota connected on 12-of-21 passes for 134 yards while running for a team-high 61 yards on nine carries.  The offense\u2019s biggest play occurred on the second play of the second quarter. Tennessee conjured up a well-executed screen pass to Henry, who used two good blocks and broke into the clear. A cut to the middle helped him finish off a 66-yard touchdown for the game\u2019s first score.  Ryan Succop accounted for the Titans\u2019 other points with field goals of 25, 39 and 38 yards, the first two coming off Jacksonville fumbles late in the first half.  It was a mistake-laden day for the Jaguars. They committed four turnovers and six penalties while also dropping a handful of passes. Dede Westbrook clanked a potential touchdown pass from Bortles in the third quarter.  Bortles completed 15-of-34 passes for 158 yards and two interceptions, finishing with a meager passer rating of 33.7.  \u201cThe good part about this is we\u2019re going home. We have earned the opportunity to play a home playoff game,\u201d Jacksonville head coach Doug Marrone said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be out there celebrating the New Year.\u201d  NOTES: Leading receiver Marqise Lee was the headliner on Jacksonville\u2019s list of inactives, which also included WR Montay Crockett, RB Chris Ivory, OL Chris Reed, OL Cam Robinson, OL William Poehls and DT Abry Jones. ... Tennessee\u2019s inactives were RB DeMarco Murray (knee), QB Brandon Weeden, DB Curtis Riley, OLB Josh Carraway, LB Nate Palmer, OL Corey Levin and WR Harry Douglas. ... Jaguars RB Leonard Fournette topped 1,000 yards for the season in the second quarter and finished with 69 yards."

On Sunday, he had 21 points to pace a 66-61 win over Georgia in the Southeastern Conference opener for both teams.  Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 on Friday during a 90-61 rout of rival Louisville.  \u201cHe\u2019s our best player,\u201d Kentucky coach John Calipari said. \u201cAnd I said the greatest thing about him; he\u2019s coming off the bench and not saying anything. Don\u2019t worry about his shots or anything, he\u2019s just playing. Smiles the whole game.\u201d  Kentucky (11-2, 1-0 SEC) also got 15 points from freshman guard Quade Green, plus 10 points and nine rebounds from redshirt freshman Hamidou Diallo. The Wildcats shot 31.5 percent in the victory, their lowest rate of the season.  \u201cThat was as selfish as any of my teams have played in a while in that first half,\u201d Calipari said.  \u201cEvery guy was trying to score. You know what a ball stopper is when you\u2019re on offense? It was going to a guy and he held it. Three guys guarding him, I\u2019m shooting it anyway. How about the easy pass up the court to the guy? Nah, I\u2019m going to wait.  \u201cEvery guy on the team and no one\u2019s passing because we\u2019re playing this way,\u201d Calipari continues. \u201cSo Tuesday we\u2019re going to do 10 passes. You must pass, you cannot dribble. You must get open and pass the ball. They\u2019re going to think it\u2019s boring. But we got to pass to each other, we got to create shots for each other. We\u2019re good enough to do that.\u201d  Georgia (9-3, 0-1) got 17 points from senior forward Yante Maten, 13 from junior forward Derek Ogbeide and 12 from freshman forward Rayshaun Hammonds.  The Bulldogs shot 39.7 percent from the floor but only 2 of 21 from 3-point range. The Wildcats made 5 of 16 3-point attempts.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of good games with Kentucky,\u201d Georgia coach Mark Fox said. \u201cThey made the plays that they needed to make to win the game, and we had one little stretch where we didn\u2019t take care of it in the second half and we lost our lead.\u201d  Kentucky trailed 53-49 with 5:18 to play, but a 7-0 run put the Wildcats on top to stay. A 3-pointer by Gilgeous-Alexander topped the run.  The teams slugged it out in the first half, and the Bulldogs went into the locker room with a 27-26 edge.  Green topped Kentucky with 13 first-half points. Gilgeous-Alexander added seven. Kentucky shot just 20.7 percent (6 of 29), including 1 of 8 from 3-point range before the break.  Georgia got eight first-half points from Maten. The Bulldogs shot only 34.3 percent and missed all 11 attempts from 3-point range prior to halftime.  The Bulldogs built a 27-20 lead with only 1:14 left in the halftime, but a technical foul against Fox led to a 6-0 Kentucky run to close the half.  \u201cThere were back-to-back plays that I thought were similar and they had different outcomes,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThat is what I was disappointed in.\u201d  NOTES: Georgia F Yante Maten entered the game No. 2 in the SEC in scoring at 20.2 points and No. 1 in rebounding at 9.3. Earlier this year, he moved into the top 10 all-time at Georgia in both categories. ... Kentucky starts five freshmen, and the average age of its roster is 19.43 years. ...

          "body": "(Reuters) - The Buffalo Bills ended the longest playoff drought in North American major team sports when they qualified for the National Football League post-season on Sunday.  The Bills were last in the playoffs when Bill Clinton was in his final year in the White House in 1999, but after 17 fruitless seasons they gave themselves a chance with a 22-16 win over the Miami Dolphins on the last day of the regular season.  The victory, however, was not enough for Buffalo, who also needed Cincinnati to beat Baltimore.  They nervously watched on television in the locker room in Miami as Bengals\u2019 quarterback Andy Dalton connected on fourth down with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Boyd to earn a 31-27 win at the death and send Buffalo\u2019s players into delirium.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d Buffalo coach Sean McDermott told reporters.  Buffalo were not the only team to seal their playoffs spot on the final day of the season with the Atlanta Falcons and Tennessee Titans also winning their respective games to earn their way into the post-season.  Tennessee beat the Jaguars 15-10 in Nashville, while the Falcons, last year\u2019s Super Bowl losers, also snuck in with a 22-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers.  The top two seeds, who earn a first round bye, in the AFC had already been decided, though the New England Patriots had to win on Sunday, which they duly did over the New York Jets, to take the number one spot ahead of the Pittsburgh Steelers.  In the NFC, the Philadelphia Eagles had already locked up top seed, though after a 6-0 loss against Dallas on Sunday they enter the post-season as an underdog with first choice quarterback Carson Wentz out with a knee injury.  The Minnesota Vikings clinched the second NFC seed with victory over the Chicago Bears.  The playoffs will begin with four wildcard games between the teams ranked three to six next Saturday and Sunday.   (This story corrects venue in the seventh para.)

          "body": "49ers beat Rams\u2019 B team for fifth straight win  LOS ANGELES \u2014 The San Francisco 49ers wish the season could keep going.  But it won\u2019t. They concluded the season with their fifth straight win, a 34-13 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.  San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo threw for 292 yards and two touchdowns along with two interceptions. San Francisco running back Carlos Hyde rushed for 90 yards and two scores.  The 49ers finished 6-10. That is not nearly good enough for a playoff berth, but with its season-ending winning streak it is good enough to give San Francisco optimism for 2018.  \u201cIt\u2019s a shame this is the end of the year,\u201d said 49ers veteran tackle Joe Staley. \u201cAnd this is coming from a guy who\u2019s in his 11th year and is 33 years old. I feel like we\u2019re going in the right direction and we\u2019ve got a special team here.\u201d  For the Rams, Sunday\u2019s late-December game was as meaningful as a late-August game. Los Angeles (11-5) already had clinched the NFC West championship and had secured a home game next weekend in the wild-card round of the NFC playoffs.  Los Angeles sat 17 of its starters, including quarterback Jared Goff, Pro-Bowl defensive tackle Aaron Donald and running back Todd Gurley II, who is a candidate for NFL MVP.  Goff\u2019s replacement, Sean Mannion, completed 20-of-34 passes for 169 yards.  With Gurley not playing, Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 running back Kareem Hunt bypassed him for the NFL rushing title. Hunt trailed Gurley by 13 yards going into Week 17. With 35 yards against Denver on Sunday, Hunt finished with a league-high 1,327 yards.  Rams head coach Sean McVay said resting starters was the right choice, no matter the outcome of Sunday\u2019s game.  \u201cI think any time you go into a football game,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re certainly going to try to win the game. But, I do think when you look at the way we approached it, we feel good about being able to allow some of our players to get some rest, a little bit of recovery time that I think is much needed for some of those guys and then you keep a couple guys out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d  The 49ers, who had 463 total offensive yards to the Rams\u2019 251, had their way with the Rams, and early.  They scored on their first two possessions. The 49ers took a 3-0 lead on a 33-yard field goal by Robbie Gould.  Garoppolo, with the sort of excellent protection he would enjoy all afternoon, lofted a short pass to wide receiver Marquise Goodwin, who was alone near the 10-yard line and jogged uncontested to the end zone to make it 10-0.  The Rams sliced their deficit to 10-3 on a 23-yard field goal by Sam Ficken with 1:15 left in the first quarter.  Gould\u2019s second field goal, this one from 48 yards, pushed the San Francisco lead to 13-3.  The 49ers added a Hyde 8-yard touchdown run with 1:13 to go in the first half. Hyde appeared to be stopped at the Rams\u2019 5-yard line, but the rugby-like scrum, powered by 49ers center Daniel Kilgore and Staley, found its way across the goal line for a 20-3 lead.  The Rams got a 21-yard field goal from Ficken on the final snap of the half. Los Angeles got the ball on Kevin Peterson\u2019s second interception of the half, and put it at the San Francisco 3 on a 50-yard completion from Mannion to Michael Thomas. The Rams decided to take the field goal instead of trying for a touchdown.  The 49ers put the game away with six minutes to go in the third quarter on a 5-yard touchdown run by Hyde. Hyde took a handoff, headed toward the middle, found traffic there and then headed around the left corner. As he dived, Hyde extended the ball with his right arm just inside the pylon to make it 27-6.  San Francisco scored on the first play of the fourth quarter \u2014 a 13-yard touchdown pass from Garoppolo to Aldrick Robinson. It was an easy score for the 49ers as Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman fell on the coverage, leaving Robinson wide open in the end zone. That made it 34-6.  Rams third-string running back Lance Dunbar scored on an 8-yard run with 6:40 left in the game for the team\u2019s only touchdown.  NOTES: The 49ers\u2019 domination of the game began in the first quarter in which they had eight first downs to the Rams\u2019 one. That Rams first down was on a roughing-the-passer penalty. ... 49ers WR Marquise Goodwin took a hard shot to the head from Rams safety Blake Countess on an incomplete pass in the second quarter. Goodwin stayed on the ground for several minutes while being attended to by the 49ers medical staff. He was placed on a cart and gave a double thumbs-up while being taken to the locker room. ... The Rams wore throwback uniforms: the royal blue jerseys with yellow accents, yellow pants with blue and white stripes, and blue helmets with yellow horns they wore from 1973 through 1999. Those are the same uniforms the Rams wore in the Warren Beatty movie \u201cHeaven Can Wait.\u201d ... Mannion said he did not feel shortchanged that his first start of the season was with a mostly second-string outfit. \u201cI have the utmost confidence in every guy on this roster,\u201d Mannion said. \u201cI thought all the guys that were out there fought their tails off.\u201d"

          "title": "Seahawks' playoff hopes end with Falcons win",
          "body": "SEATTLE \u2014 The Arizona Cardinals, knowing an uneven season would end Sunday regardless of outcome, looked to end on a high note.  Aided by four field goals from kicker Phil Dawson \u2014 including a game-winning 42-yarder with 2:21 left \u2014 the Cardinals got that satisfying ending, edging the Seahawks, 26-24, in front of 69,078 at CenturyLink Field.  Arizona (8-8) won three of its final four games to push its record to .500 for the season, and gave head coach Bruce Arians his 50th win with the franchise, the most by any coach in its history.  \u201cIt\u2019s a sweet end to a bitter season,\u201d Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald said.  For Seattle, it was a bitter end.  Minutes before kicker Blair Walsh missed a 48-yard attempt with 32 seconds to play that would have all but sealed a win for the Seahawks (9-7), Atlanta beat Carolina to clinch the final NFC wild-card spot, eliminating Seattle from playoff contention.  The Seahawks dropped three of their final four games, seeing a playoff streak that dated back to quarterback Russell Wilson\u2019s rookie season in 2012 end.  \u201cI think this game today was almost a microcosm of this season,\u201d Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cThe slow starts, the getting in our own way, making it hard on us at times when it wasn\u2019t about the opponent, it was about us.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that kind of showed up again today.\u201d  Carroll said it was disappointing Seattle wasn\u2019t able to change the narrative in many of their games.  Sunday, the Seahawks got off to a slow start, managing just 24 yards of offense in the first half before roaring back late.  The Seahawks entered Arizona territory for the first time with 12:40 remaining in the third quarter. Wilson found tight end Jimmy Graham across the middle on a crucial fourth-and-6 play, setting up Seattle\u2019s first offensive touchdown of the game.  He then found Doug Baldwin in the back of the end zone for an 18-yard score to cut Arizona\u2019s lead to 20-14 with 8:59 to play in the third quarter.  After Seattle and Arizona exchanged field goals, Wilson connected with Baldwin again on a 29-yard scoring strike to give the Seahawks their only lead, 24-23, with 10:24 to go.  Wilson\u2019s second touchdown pass was his 19th in the fourth quarter this season, an NFL record. He finished 18 of 29 for 221 yards and the two scores.  Seattle\u2019s defense limited the Cardinals to 71 yards of offense in the second half, but quarterback Drew Stanton \u2014 playing in just his fifth game this season \u2014 led Arizona on its decisive 10-play, 62-yard drive.  \u201cWe had a lead, and we didn\u2019t do enough offensively to continue to spread that lead out, but when we needed to make plays, we stepped up,\u201d Stanton said.  Dawson spoiled Seattle\u2019s rally with his 42-yard field goal, and Walsh\u2019s miss \u2014 his eighth of the season \u2014 put the final damper on Seattle\u2019s season.  The Cardinals have won three consecutive games in Seattle, and took a 19-18-1 series lead into the offseason.  \u201cThank you for coming to my house,\u201d Arians said to open his postgame press conference. \u201cI hope you get home safe. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of a group of guys.\u201d  Seattle\u2019s late comeback seemed unlikely after Arizona took firm control on both sides of the ball early, entering halftime with a 20-7 lead.  Stanton completed all six of his passes on the game\u2019s opening drive, eventually connecting with Jaron Brown for a 25-yard touchdown.  Tyler Lockett busted up the middle of the field on the ensuing kickoff for a 99-yard score, but that was the lone bright spot for the Seahawks before the half.  Dawson connected for two field goals in each half \u2014 of 49, 46, 53 and 42 yards \u2014 to help hold off Seattle, and Elijhaa Penny\u2019s 4-yard touchdown plunge in the second quarter padded the halftime lead.  Both franchises enter a transition period, acknowledging changes will be coming in the offseason.  \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the same look,\u201d Seahawks safety Earl Thomas said. \u201cThere (are) going to be some new pieces, and some guys that we love here might not be here. You never know.\u201d  Neither Fitzgerald nor Arians made decisive comments about possible retirement following the game.  Fitzgerald said he will celebrate his son\u2019s birthday Monday, spend several days golfing, and will take some time to figure it out.  Arians, 65, said family and health will be contributing factors on if he decides to return next season.  NOTES: Seattle WR Doug Baldwin finished with four receptions for 90 yards and Seattle\u2019s only two offensive touchdowns. ... Seattle committed eight penalties for 100 yards, including one that led to an Arizona score, and another that took the Seahawks out of field-goal range in the third quarter. ... Cardinals WR Larry Fitzgerald finished with eight catches for 55 yards, giving him 109 receptions for the season, trailing only Miami\u2019s Jarvis Landry (112). "

          "title": "Lightning strike Blue Jackets with 4-goal second period",
          "body": "Lightning strike Blue Jackets with 4-goal second period  COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 The best team in the NHL during the first three months of the season closed out 2017 with one of the best months in team history.  The Tampa Bay Lightning capped a December to remember with a 5-0 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday night at Nationwide Arena, ending the calendar year with 11 wins in their last 13 games.  The Lightning (28-8-2) are happy entering the new year with the most wins (28) and points (58) in the NHL.  \u201cWe missed the playoffs last year and to be in the position we are right now definitely there\u2019s a lot of confidence,\u201d Lightning right winger Nikita Kucherov said. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at the standings. We just play every game.\u201d  After a scoreless first period during which the Lightning managed just five shots on goal, they unleashed a barrage led by Tyler Johnson that resulted in four goals in less than nine minutes at the start of the second period.  Johnson began the scoring with two goals 3 1/2 minutes apart early in the take-charge second period, the 100th and 101st of his career. Kucherov followed with his NHL-leading 25th of the season and Cory Conacher with his third.  Steven Stamkos added his 17th goal of the season in the third period.  The Lightning recognize their talent up and down the lineup, but they admit they\u2019re surprised with how well the first part of the season has gone.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough to say we envisioned that,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut at the same time, we have so much faith in this group, in this team. We\u2019re think we\u2019re one of the best teams if not the best in the league and we want to prove that.\u201d  Kucherov is one of the Lightning\u2019s dynamic playmakers. He added an assist to his goal, boosting his league-best point total to 55.  Brayden Point, Victor Hedman and Mikhail Sergachev chipped in with two assists each.  Johnson continued a torrid month with a point in his 12th consecutive game. He finished December with eight goals and a career-high 18 points, topping his previous best of 17 points in December 2014.  \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it. We have a lot of guys who can make plays,\u201d Lightning defenseman Anton Stralman said. \u201cTonight, we showed up for 40 minutes and we really took it to them.\u201d  The first 20 minutes were a different story. The Lightning managed just five shots compared with the Blue Jackets\u2019 13 and Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper let his players know during the intermission that he wasn\u2019t pleased with the effort.  \u201cI flipped, that\u2019s basically what happened,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWe had five shots. You\u2019re never going to win like that. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve really been harping on the guys. It came to a little bit of a blow after the first.  \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to give the guys a ton of credit. They came out and they executed. We got one, we got two, and we tried to break their will in the second. If we wanted a chance to win this hockey game, we had to change our game and we did that.\u201d  Tampa Bay shifted into another gear after a scoreless opening period, outshooting the Blue Jackets 23-6 in the second while bouncing back from a 5-3 home loss on Friday to the Philadelphia Flyers.  Johnson\u2019s first goal came 1:22 into the second period and his second at 4:49 on a one-timer off a pass from Point in front of Blue Jackets goaltender Joonas Korpisalo.  Kucherov made it 3-0 at 7:53 of the second period and Conacher scored the final goal of the period past a screened Korpisalo at 8:45.  Stamkos scored the only goal in the third period with assists going to Hedman, his 25th of the season, and Kucherov, his 31st.  \u201cThey smelled blood, to be honest with you,\u201d Blue Jackets captain Nick Foligno said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything right in those 10-12 minutes (of the second period). We got it handed to us.\u201d  Andrei Vasilevskiy posted his league-leading 25th victory and shut out the Blue Jackets for the second time this season. He finished with 21 saves in his league-leading fifth shutout this season.  \u201cI truly believe he\u2019s the best goalie in the world right now,\u201d Johnson said.  The injury-plagued Blue Jackets (22-15-3) are headed in the opposite direction. They lost for the fourth time in five games and sixth time in the last eight.  \u201cWe\u2019re just going to go about our business,\u201d Blue Jackets coach John Tortorella said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be throw our hands up in the air, and kick and scream and whine. We\u2019ve just got to stay together as a team.  \u201cWe\u2019re just going to try to work it out. That\u2019s all we can do. It\u2019s a humbling league. No one is going to feel sorry for you. You just have to go to work.\u201d  Korpisalo, a surprise starter for the Blue Jackets, stopped 30 of 35 shots and wasn\u2019t challenged in the first period. But the next 20 minutes were much different.  \u201cWe just lost ourselves,\u201d Tortorella said.  NOTES: The Lightning swept the three-game season series. ... The Lightning recalled G Louis Domingue from Syracuse of the American Hockey League. Domingue, 25, is 9-4-0 with a 2.39 goals-against average and .911 save percentage for the Crunch this season. He also has played in seven NHL games with the Coyotes this season and is 0-6-0 with a 4.33 GAA and .856 save percentage. ... Lightning backup G Peter Budaj sustained a left leg injury during a 5-3 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers on Friday. He was placed on injured reserve a day later. ... Blue Jackets F Boone Jenner played in his 300th NHL game. ... G Sergei Bobrovsky was out of the Blue Jackets\u2019 lineup after going 4-6-2 in his last 12 games."

          "body": "Winston guides Bucs to improbable win over Saints  TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 The New Orleans Saints have their first NFC South division title since 2011, but the ending of Sunday\u2019s game was not what they had in mind.  It was a jaw-dropping defeat.  Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston tossed a 39-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chris Godwin with nine seconds remaining \u2014 capping a desperation 95-yard drive with no timeouts \u2014 to produce a 31-24 victory over the Saints on Sunday at Raymond James Stadium.  Despite the loss, the Saints backed into the franchise\u2019s first division title since 2011 because the Carolina Panthers were beaten by the Atlanta Falcons.  The No. 4-seeded Saints (11-5) will host the No. 5 Panthers (11-5) in the first round next Sunday at 4:40 p.m. ET.  \u201cObviously, we didn\u2019t finish the game the way we would\u2019ve liked,\u201d Saints head coach Sean Payton said. \u201cWe have to move on.\u201d  The Bucs (5-11), just two days after second-year head coach Dirk Koetter learned he would be retained for the 2018 season, broke a five-game losing streak and Winston (28 of 51 for 363 yards) gained a measure of redemption after throwing three critical interceptions earlier in the game.  \u201cThe good guys won,\u201d Koetter said.  The Saints, meanwhile, must move on and prepare for the postseason.  \u201cIt would\u2019ve been much different in that locker room, emotionally, had we won that game,\u201d Saints quarterback Drew Brees said. \u201cBut the bottom line is I think we recognize there are things we can work on and improve upon.\u201d  With the Saints leading 24-23, a New Orleans punt was downed at Tampa Bay\u2019s 5-yard line. The Bucs had used all three of their timeouts on the previous New Orleans drive and faced a precarious situation at the two-minute warning.  After three consecutive incompletions, Winston found tight end Cameron Brate for a 12-yard gain on fourth-and-10 and the dramatic drive was on.  Winston had three completions to Mike Evans on the drive, then found Godwin, a Penn State rookie, open in the end zone for his first NFL touchdown. Winston added a 2-point conversion pass to Evans.  \u201cIncredible drive by Jameis,\u201d Koetter said. \u201cDown at the 5-yard line, no timeouts. He was very patient, getting things in 10-yard chunks. He was very calm.\u201d  \u201cThank God for Chris Godwin,\u201d Winston said. \u201cThis is the perfect example of what winning does. When you win, it\u2019s all good. When you lose, everything is a problem. We\u2019re very happy right now.\u201d  Earlier, it appeared that Brees (22 of 30 for 245 yards) had engineered the game-winner.  After the Bucs had taken a 24-20 lead and pinned the Saints on their 8-yard line following the kickoff, the Brees-led offense effectively sliced through Tampa Bay\u2019s defense.  Brees completed 5 of 6 passes for 57 yards during the 13-play, 92-yard drive, including a 3-yard touchdown to running back Zach Line with 7:13 remaining.  The Bucs got a 42-yard field goal from Patrick Murray with 4:31 remaining, cutting New Orleans\u2019 lead to 24-23. The Saints tried to run out the clock, but Brees was sacked on third-and-10. That led to the punt to the 5-yard line, which Winston converted into a massive opportunity.  Winston\u2019s ill-advised end-zone pick to Saints rookie safety Marcus Williams, his second interception of the game, led to Wil Lutz\u2019s 48-yard field goal and a 17-13 New Orleans advantage after three quarters.  Tampa Bay\u2019s fate appeared more dire at the start of the fourth quarter when Winston was sacked on third down and the Bucs were forced to punt.  But Saints return man Tommylee Lewis was stripped by Tampa Bay\u2019s Josh Robinson and the fumble was recovered by Isaiah Johnson, who scooped it up and scored from the 7. Murray\u2019s extra-point attempt gave the Bucs a 20-17 lead.  Rookie running back Alvin Kamara accounted for both New Orleans touchdowns in the first two quarters, when the Saints assumed a 14-13 advantage at halftime.  NOTES: Brees finished with a 72.0 completion percentage to set an NFL single-season record, breaking the mark of 71.6 set by Minnesota\u2019s Sam Bradford in 2016. Brees now holds three of the top four completion percentage marks. He completed 71.2 percent in 2011 to rank third and 70.6 in 2009 to tie for fourth, along with Cincinnati\u2019s Ken Anderson (1982). ... Bucs WR Mike Evans became the third player in NFL history to have 1,000 or more receiving yards for the fourth straight year to open his career. Evans joined Randy Moss (Minnesota Vikings) and A.J. Green (Cincinnati Bengals). ... The Bucs were without inactive WR DeSean Jackson (ankle) and DE Robert Ayers (shoulder), while the Saints juggled their offensive line with the absence of LT Terron Armstead (thigh). Andrus Peat shifted from left guard to left tackle, while Senio Kelemete was plugged in at left guard. ... This was the 52nd meeting between the two teams and the Saints now lead the series, 32-20. ... The Saints have won seven straight at home, but now have lost three straight on the road. ... Buccaneers DT Gerald McCoy came into the game leading Tampa Bay with six sacks. He did not record any sacks on Sunday, but did have two tackles for loss."

          "body": "SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A Costa Rican plane crashed into woodland off a popular tourist beach on Sunday, killing 10 U.S. citizens and two local pilots, the Costa Rican government said.  The accident occurred in the mountainous area off the Punta Islita beach town in the province of Guanacaste, about 230 km (140 miles) west of the capital of San Jose.   Enio Cubillo, director of Costa Rica\u2019s civil aviation agency, said the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft operated by local company Nature Air had crashed minutes after take-off, but that officials had not yet determined the cause of the crash.  The plane had passed a safety inspection about a month ago and was authorized to fly, Cubillo said. Although strong winds in the morning had forced the pilots to alter their itinerary, they had flown safely to Punto Islita to pick up passengers headed to San Jose.  Nature Air said in a statement that it lamented the accident, without explaining the cause. The flight was part of a special charter service for 20 people, relying on two planes. The first plane, carrying 10 passengers, arrived safely in San Jose at 11:40 a.m. The second, with 10 passengers and two pilots, departed 20 minutes later.    \u201cRegrettably this plane crashed a few minutes after taking off,\u201d Nature Air said.   A video of the crash site obtained from Costa Rica\u2019s Security Ministry shows orange flames consuming a pile of blackened ruins, with plane parts scattered in an area thick with trees.  Laura Chinchilla, who was president of Costa Rica from 2010 to 2014, said on Twitter that her cousin, one of the pilots, had died in the accident.   A U.S. State Department official confirmed that multiple U.S. citizens had died, but said the agency would not provide further details out of respect for the affected families.   \u201cThere are no people alive,\u201d Costa Rica\u2019s Security Minister Gustavo Mata said, adding that autopsies would be needed to confirm the total number and identities of victims because their remains were badly burned.   Punta Islita, on Costa Rica\u2019s Pacific Coast, is popular among North American and European tourists for its pristine beaches and lush landscape.

          "body": "EDMONTON, Alberta \u2014 The Winnipeg Jets will begin the New Year in first place in the Central Division thanks to a convincing 5-0 win over the Edmonton Oilers on Sunday.  The Jets improved to 23-11-6, dealing another serious blow to Edmonton\u2019s fast-fading playoff hopes.  It was never close. The Jets led 2-0 after one period, 4-0 after two periods and piled on in the third. The goals were scored by Mark Dano, Blake Wheeler, Kyle Connor, Bryan Little and Mathieu Perreault.  Goaltender Connor Hellebuyck earned the shutout with 35 saves. Edmonton\u2019s Cam Talbot stopped 33 of the 38 shots he faced.  The Jets wasted no time jumping on the fragile Oilers, scoring on the first shot of the game just 2:34 after the opening faceoff. The goal came off the stick of Dano, who scored on the first shift of his first game back after being a healthy scratch for 30 straight games.  Despite their need to climb back into the playoff race, the Oilers (17-19-3) didn\u2019t show much urgency in the opening period and found themselves down 2-0 when Oilers defenseman Matt Benning turned the puck over in front of his own net and Wheeler made him pay for it at 13:16.  The Jets didn\u2019t take their foot off the gas in the second period, not that Edmonton offered much in the way of resistance.  The Oilers\u2019 penalty-killing, which is dead last in the NHL at home, let the team down again. Jets winger Connor scored on Winnipeg\u2019s first power play of the game, pretty much sealing the deal with half a game to go.  The Jets made it 4-0 at 19:57 of the second period when Little, left all alone in front of the Edmonton net, scored his seventh of the season.  The Jets added another power-play goal at 7:26 of the third period, this time from Perreault on Winnipeg\u2019s second power play of the game.  NOTES: With the return of D Oscar Klefbom, the Oilers are 100 percent healthy for the first time this season. ... While Edmonton has the fifth best penalty-killing percentage on the road (.851), the Oilers are significantly worse on home ice (.574). ... Winnipeg is 1-5-3 in its past nine road games. ... Sunday marked the sixth time this season that the Jets scored on their first shot of the game. That is the highest total in the NHL. ...

          "body": "Early surge fuels Giants past Redskins in finale  EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 The New York Giants ended a turbulent season on a positive note.  New York scored two touchdowns in just over two minutes and topped the Washington Redskins 18-10 in the regular-season finale Sunday at MetLife Stadium.  The Giants\u2019 first score came when running back Orleans Darkwa scampered 75 yards for a touchdown on the second play of the opening drive. However, the ensuing point-after attempt by Aldrick Rosas was blocked.  \u201cThat first play was huge for us,\u201d said center Brett Jones. \u201cYou see him break it open and it really set the tone for us and got us off on the right foot.\u201d  The Giants then got an interception by linebacker Kelvin Sheppard, who picked off Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins\u2019 pass intended for receiver Josh Doctson. Sheppard returned the interception 12 yards to give the Giants the ball on the Washington 19-yard line.  Two plays later, Eli Manning connected with receiver Hunter Sharp for a 16-yard touchdown to make it 12-0 after the two-point conversion fell short. Manning was making his 216th appearance, which ties Hall-of-Fame defensive end Michael Strahan\u2019s franchise record for the most games played in a Giants uniform.  The Giants, who have struggled to run the ball all year, finished with a season-high 260 rushing yards, 154 of which were recorded by Darkwa on 20 carries with rookie Wayne Gallman adding another 89 yards on 15 carries.  Perhaps even more impressive was that the Giants were able to accomplish that behind their ninth different starting offensive line combination which, by game\u2019s end, had turned into combination No. 10 when left guard John Jerry, the only member of the offensive line who managed to play in each of the team\u2019s 16 games, had to leave with a concussion.  \u201cWe just had a lot of fun today,\u201d said Jones, who has started every game at center for the Giants since Week 5.  \u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating all year, but we came out today and got the run game going against a division opponent that knew what we were going to do and still execute our game plan, so it was a lot of fun and everyone embraced each other.\u201d  Washington (7-9) finally got on the board thanks to a turnover by linebacker Preston Smith, who picked off Manning\u2019s screen pass intended for running back Gallman. Two plays later, Cousins scored on a 12-yard naked bootleg to trim the Giants\u2019 lead to 12-7.  The Giants and the Redskins exchanged first-half field goals, a 23-yarder by Rosas with 4:49 left in the first quarter, and a 49-yarder by Washington\u2019s Dustin Hopkins with four seconds left in the half, which cut New York\u2019s lead to 15-10.  Hopkins missed a 47-yard field-goal attempt in the third quarter while Rosas hit a 29-yarder at the start of the fourth quarter to extend the Giants lead to 18-10.  Cousins, who is likely headed to free agency barring a last-minute contract extension from Washington, certainly didn\u2019t end his 2017 season the way he hoped, completing 20-of-37 pass attempts for 158 yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions.  Washington head coach Jay Gruden agreed that Cousins might have been pressing a little too hard this week to make something happen.  \u201cYeah, I think sometimes that happens when things aren\u2019t going well, you try to force the issue sometimes a little bit and he wanted to give receivers an opportunity to make some plays and unfortunately it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cSo, trying to force a big play sometimes makes matters worse and that\u2019s something that happened today.\u201d  Cousins admitted that he was probably a little too aggressive with his passes because he was trying to make something happen to help catch the Giants in the scoring column.  \u201cThe short answer is yes, I was aggressive. The first INT was a protection issue where I sent the line and tried to have an educated guess as to where the pressure was coming from and ended up being incorrect.  \u201cThe second was a play-action pass that I would have normally checked it down, but I was too aggressive in the moment. ... so I left it short intentionally. I was trying to be aggressive and manufacture something in the game.\u201d  Despite Cousins\u2019 shaky season-ending performance, Gruden said he\u2019d be happy to have the quarterback back under center next season.  \u201cWe have to have stability at that position somehow some way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have (a quarterback), you\u2019d like to keep one, but we\u2019ll have to make that decision pretty soon. It\u2019s not totally up to us \u2014 Kirk will have to buy in as well \u2014 but we also have 18, 19 other free agents we\u2019d like to take care of also.\u201d  For Cousins, the offseason of uncertainty is nothing new.  \u201cI\u2019ve been in this position for three years,\u201d he said, declining to get specific as to his current thought process. \u201cThere will be a lot of weeks leading up to free agency to talk about it, but it\u2019s all about winning.\u201d  The Giants (3-13) finish with a 1-5 mark against the NFC East and have locked up the No. 2 overall pick in the draft thanks to the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 22-13 win over the Houston Texans.  They will also be facing an offseason of uncertainty as new general manager Dave Gettleman, hired last week, works through the process of finding a new head coach and figuring out how to reshape a roster that started out with so much promise, but which also vastly underachieved.  \u201cThe season is over and the organization has to get rolling,\u201d said interim head coach Steve Spagnuolo, who will have an opportunity to interview for the permanent head coaching position if he wants it.  \u201cWe\u2019ll see what unwinds. We got the exit physicals tomorrow from eight to 12, got a team meeting at 12 o\u2019clock. I know Dave wants to address the team, which is what you do. We\u2019ll lay out what we have to do going forward and then we\u2019ll take it day by day.\u201d  NOTES: The Giants have won the last three games against Washington in games played in December and have split the season series with their NFC East foes in each of the last three seasons. ... Giants starting LG John Jerry was ruled out of the game with a concussion in the first quarter. He was replaced by John Greco. Also, reserve DT Jay Bromley left the game with an ankle injury and did not return. ... Washington RB Samaje Perine suffered an ankle injury in the first quarter and did not return. Also, Redskins LT Ty Nsekhe did not return after suffering a knee injury in the first half. ... Washington OLB Ryan Kerrigan finished with 4.0 sacks this season against the Giants. He has now has 9.0 career sacks against them."

          "body": "* Dec exports up 8.9 pct y/y, imports up 13.0 pct y/y  * Exports rise 15.8 percent for full year  * 2017 exports best since 1956 by value - trade ministry  * Sales of memory chips, petrochemical goods post double-digit growth in Dec  * Growth seen slowing in 2018  By Cynthia Kim  SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Soaring global demand for memory chips and petrochemicals helped South Korea\u2019s exports surge 8.9 percent in December, lifting its 2017 shipments to the highest on record in value terms.  Exports for the year as a whole jumped $573.9 billion or 15.8 percent, data showed on Monday, making last year the best since relevant data began to be compiled in 1956.  The government is expecting still-solid but more modest export growth of 4 percent this year. With the economy riding the global trade boom, South Korea\u2019s central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than six years in November.  \u201cDownside risks for South Korea are the won\u2019s strength, rising interest rates and oil prices. They are the new three risks,\u201d trade minister Paik Un-gyu said in a statement.  A further wild cards will be trade talks with the United States, which is keen to revise a 2012 deal to reduce its trade deficit with South Korea. Talks will begin on Jan. 5.  December\u2019s 8.9 percent expansion slightly underperformed the 10.3 percent growth forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and eased from 9.5 percent in November.  But six of the nation\u2019s major export products, including semiconductors, petrochemical products, computers posted double-digit expansion from a year earlier, even as the month had two fewer working days than in December 2016.  Imports jumped 13 percent December from a year earlier, beating the 12.1 percent expansion seen in the survey and 12.7 percent in the previous month.  South Korea\u2019s stellar export performance comes even as the won\u2019s strong gains have been making its goods more expensive for global consumers.  The won appreciated 13 percent against the U.S. dollar last year, ending 2017 at a 32-month high of 1,074.1.  For the whole of 2017, exports to China jumped 14.2 percent, while those to the United States and European Union expanded 3.2 percent 16 percent, respectively.  Shipments of memory chips jumped 57.4 percent last year, while petrochemical goods grew 31.7 percent.  Imports rose 17.7 percent in 2017, supported by an increase in equipment needed to produce memory chips and display products, the trade ministry said.

          "body": "Chargers miss playoffs, Raiders fire coach  CARSON, Calif. \u2014 The Los Angeles Chargers were out of the playoff picture despite beating the Oakland Raiders 30-10 at the StubHub Center on Sunday.  Raiders head coach Jack Del Rio was out of a job minutes after his squad lost their fourth in a row. Del Rio revealed in his postgame briefing that Oakland owner Mark Davis had relieved him of his duties.  \u201cI appreciate the opportunity he gave me,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cIt was a great honor for me to lead the organization.\u201d  Philip Rivers led the Chargers by throwing for three touchdowns, Keenan Allen had a pair of scores and Los Angeles completed its season sweep in front of a pro-Raiders crowd of 25,430.  Despite the Chargers (9-7) winning for the sixth time in seven games, they didn\u2019t qualify for the postseason as an AFC wild-card team. Saddled by an 0-4 start, the franchise missed the playoffs for the seventh season in eight years.  \u201cThere is a lot of disappointment,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cBecause we know we let some games get away.\u201d  The Raiders (6-10) ended a disappointing season with their fourth straight loss as once again they struggled on offense. It was their fourth consecutive game in which they scored 17 or fewer points.  \u201cIt was a microcosm of our year,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cWe had opportunities, but there was just a lack of production.\u201d  Rivers competed 28-of-37 passes for 387 yards and three scores as he lifted his lifetime mark against the Raiders to 16-8. But it wasn\u2019t enough to extend the season.  \u201cWe are a pretty hot football team,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cBut we are going home.\u201d  Allen had a game-high 133 receiving yards on nine catches.  Marshawn Lynch of the Raiders paced all rushers with 101 yards on 19 carries as he became the 31st player to reach the 10,000-yard mark.  Oakland quarterback Derek Carr scuffled as he hit on just 19-of-28 passes for 243 yards with a touchdown and interception.  \u201cWe were fighting and competing, it was there,\u201d Carr said. \u201cBut it was the details of the assignments that we were missing.\u201d  Travis Benjamin hauled in Rivers\u2019 third touchdown pass, a 62-yarder in the third quarter for a 30-10 edge.  Nick Rose, whose first two efforts, a field goal and extra point, were blocked, was good from 25 yards out in inflating the Chargers\u2019 cushion to 23-10.  L.A. converted Carr\u2019s career-high tying 13th interception into six points just before the half. Rivers connected with Allen from 6 yards to push the Chargers ahead 20-10, as the extra point was blocked.  Rivers clicked with Tyrell Williams on a 56-yard scoring pass as the Chargers went back into the lead 14-10. Williams slipped behind the Raiders\u2019 secondary unencumbered and scored easily.  The Chargers\u2019 season-long kicking woes surfaced midway through the second quarter when Rose\u2019s 50-yard field-goal attempt was blocked by Justin Ellis and recovered by Keith McGill II. Giorgio Tavecchio\u2019s 40-yard field goal pushed the Raiders ahead 10-7.  Oakland tied the game 7-7 on Carr\u2019s 87-yard strike to Amari Cooper down the middle of the Chargers\u2019 defense. It was a blown coverage by the safeties that the Raiders exploited as Jahleel Addae thought he had help on top from safety Tre Boston. Instead, Cooper went in untouched in the second quarter with his career-long reception to energize the pro-Raiders crowd.  The Chargers broke the scoreless tie two minutes into the second quarter on Allen\u2019s unlikely touchdown. Melvin Gordon had scampered 13 yards when the ball squirted from his grasp during a tackle. Allen, running to Gordon\u2019s left, plucked the ball from midair and ran it in 27 yards for the touchdown. It capped a season-high 99-yard drive.  But Sunday\u2019s win couldn\u2019t earn the Chargers the last AFC playoff invitation.  \u201cYou only play for one reason and that is to win a championship,\u201d Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn said. \u201cWho cares if you end up in second or third place, let\u2019s be honest. Right now I\u2019m just disappointed that our season is over.\u201d  NOTES: Raiders CB Sean Smith started in place of David Amerson (foot) as he sat out his ninth straight game. ... DE Mario Edwards Jr. (ankle) was forced from the game. ... Chargers DT Corey Liuget (knee) couldn\u2019t play and was replaced by Darius Philon. ... QB Philip Rivers became the ninth player to reach 50,000 passing yards."

          "body": "Falcons beat Panthers to earn playoff berth  ATLANTA \u2014 The Atlanta Falcons are heading back to the playoffs and the Carolina Panthers will have to settle for a wild-card spot as well thanks to five second-half field goals by Matt Bryant.  The 42-year-old Bryant, a 16-year veteran, included a 56-yarder among his kicks and the Falcons made life miserable for Carolina quarterback Cam Newton in a 22-10 victory Sunday.  The Falcons (10-6) claimed the second wild-card berth in the NFC with the victory, while the Panthers (11-5) had to settle for the first wild-card spot rather than the NFC South title because of the loss.  Carolina finished in a tie with New Orleans, which lost 31-24 at Tampa Bay, but the Saints beat the Panthers twice during the season to earn the division title and home field in the first round.  \u201cProbably like anyone else, I\u2019m mad, disappointed, take your pick,\u201d Carolina head coach Ron Rivera said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things you have to take advantage of. You have the opportunity in front of you and you have to win the football game. But you\u2019ve got to give them credit. (The Falcons) played well and we didn\u2019t.\u201d  The Saints and Panthers will meet in New Orleans next Sunday at 4:40 p.m. ET in the opening round of the playoffs, while the Falcons \u2014 NFC champions last season \u2014 play at the Los Angeles Rams on Saturday at 8:15 p.m. ET.  \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be in,\u201d said Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who passed for 318 yards and a touchdown. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got more work to do.\u201d  Bryant\u2019s fifth field goal, from 33 yards with 2:27 remaining, came after Newton threw his second of three interceptions, this one the first of safety Keanu Neal\u2019s career.  Bryant hit from 56 yards with 6:37 left after earlier kicks of 30, 42 and 30 yards.  \u201cHe\u2019s such a competitor, and we really rely and count on him,\u201d Falcons head coach Dan Quinn said. \u201cNo moment is too big for him. Part of being a really successful kicker is having mental toughness, and he\u2019s got that in abundance.\u201d  Newton misfired on his first nine passes and finished 14 of 34 for 180 yards and one touchdown while being sacked twice. His third interception, by cornerback Robert Alford, came in the end zone on the next-to-last play of the game.  \u201cWe missed some opportunities (in the passing game) with some balls ricocheting off hands and we missed some throws,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cA lot of things went wrong.\u201d  Ryan, the NFL MVP a season ago, was 28 of 45 while not throwing an interception and being sacked just once.  Ryan, who threw for at least 4,000 yards for the seventh time, came into the game with 12 interceptions to 19 touchdowns after throwing just seven interceptions compared to 38 touchdowns last season.  The Falcons went ahead in the third quarter on field goals of 30 and 42 yards by Bryant, then led by nine points after his 30-yarder in the first minute of the fourth quarter.  Bryant\u2019s first field goal came after video review overturned an apparent 12-yard touchdown pass from Ryan to Mohamed Sanu, and the second followed an interception by safety Ricardo Allen. His third field goal capped a drive of 60 yards.  A 44-yard field goal by Graham Gano got the Panthers back within six points, but Bryant connected on his 56-yarder with 6:37 remaining to make it a two-score game.  Neal\u2019s interception to set up Bryant\u2019s final field goal came on a high pass that went off the hand of Panthers tight end Greg Olsen.  \u201cBasically, it\u2019s like we\u2019re starting back 0-0 and everybody is fighting for the same thing now,\u201d Falcons defensive tackle Grady Jarrett said of the playoffs. \u201cForget what\u2019s behind and look forward at what\u2019s ahead. We\u2019re confident in our abilities and looking forward to trying to make a run.\u201d  The Falcons scored on their first possession for just the fourth time this season as running back Devonta Freeman covered 19 yards with a short pass from Ryan to cap a 10-play, 75-yard drive after the opening kickoff.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing against a good defense like Carolina, any time you can get some points early and get momentum going is big,\u201d Ryan said.  The Panthers drove 78 yards in 16 plays, holding the ball for more than eight minutes, to tie the game 7-7 on a 4-yard touchdown pass from Newton to Devin Funchess with 50 seconds left before halftime.  Newton was 7 of 7 for 66 yards on that drive after going 0 of 9 on the Panthers\u2019 first four possessions.  NOTES: The Panthers were without three starters \u2014 RB Jonathan Stewart (back tightness), RG Trai Turner (concussion) and FS Kurt Coleman (ankle). Turner was ruled out of his third straight game Friday, while Coleman had been listed as questionable. Stewart was not on the injury report. ... Falcons C Alex Mack (calf) started, but LG Andy Levitre, who had missed the previous three games, reinjured his triceps on the game\u2019s first series. ... Falcons WR Taylor Gabriel (hamstring) left the game in the first quarter and DE Adrian Clayborn limped off in the fourth quarter. ... TE Levine Toilolo (knee) was inactive for the Falcons. ... DT Vernon Butler (shoulder) left the game in the second quarter for the Panthers and TE Chris Manhertz (ankle) was lost in the third quarter."

          "body": "Bills beat Dolphins, earn first playoff berth since 1999  MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \u2014 Finally, the Buffalo Bills can party like it\u2019s 1999.  The Bills reached the playoffs for the first time since 1999, defeating the Miami Dolphins 22-16 on Sunday at Hard Rock Stadium.  Buffalo (9-7) had to wait about 15 minutes after its game to officially make the playoffs. That happened when the Baltimore Ravens lost the lead with 44 seconds left and fell to the Cincinnati Bengals, 31-27.  \u201cThis is such an emotional moment,\u201d Bills head coach Sean McDermott said. \u201cNo one gave this team a chance all year long.  \u201cOur fans have been great all season long, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing them at our playoff game.\u201d  Prior to Sunday, Buffalo had the longest active playoff drought in all four major U.S. team sports. Major League Baseball\u2019s Seattle Mariners now have the longest drought, dating to 2001.  But despite the joy expressed by McDermott and his players, there was one concern for the Bills, who suffered a key injury in the third quarter when six-time Pro-Bowl running back LeSean McCoy left the game due to a right ankle sprain. He did not return.  Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor took up the slack, completing 19-of-27 passes for 204 yards and one touchdown, with no interceptions. He also scrambled for 35 yards.  Taylor was thrilled with the Bills making the playoffs, which will begin for Buffalo at the Jacksonville Jaguars next Sunday.  \u201cI watched the end of the Bengals game next to (McCoy),\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI can\u2019t even think of the words to describe what our locker room was like.  \u201cThe best part is that this is just the beginning.\u201d  Miami (6-10), which has missed the playoffs in 14 of the past 16 years, challenged late with 13 consecutive points and a recovered onside kick with 1:52 remaining. But an interception by Bills safety Jordan Poyer \u2014 his fifth of the season \u2014 sealed Buffalo\u2019s win.  The Dolphins benched veteran quarterback Jay Cutler after just one series, opting for David Fales, a sixth-round pick of the Chicago Bears in 2014.  \u201cI talked to Jay about it,\u201d Dolphins head coach Adam Gase said of the decision to insert Fales. \u201cJay was great. He said, \u2018Let him play a full game,\u2019\u201d  Prior to Sunday, Fales had attempted just six NFL passes. He completed 29-of-42 passes for 265 yards with one interception and one touchdown pass against Buffalo. He also scored his first career touchdown.  \u201cI really wasn\u2019t too nervous,\u201d Fales said. \u201cBut running on the field, (the nerves did get) going a bit.\u201d  Cutler\u2019s 12-year NFL career, meanwhile, may be over. He retired after last season, but returned when Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill got injured.  As for the game details, Buffalo never trailed.  The Bills scored on their opening possession as Taylor rolled left and threw to the right, hitting wide open Nick O\u2019Leary in the end zone for a 26-yard touchdown.  O\u2019Leary, a tight end from nearby West Palm Beach, Fla., is the grandson of golfing legend Jack Nicklaus, who was in the stands on Sunday. It was O\u2019Leary\u2019s second career touchdown catch.  On Buffalo\u2019s next drive, Taylor overthrew an open O\u2019Leary in the end zone, and the Bills settled for a 23-yard field goal by Stephen Hauschka.  After a 51-yard, third-quarter field goal by Hauschka, the Bills increased their lead to 19-0 on a one-yard run by 12th-year defensive tackle Kyle Williams, who scored for the first time in his career.  The game\u2019s final minutes featured fireworks.  Miami\u2019s Jarvis Landry broke his own team record with his 111th reception of the season. He fumbled on the play, and linebacker Preston Brown returned the football for an apparent 99-yard touchdown.  But a video review showed Landry had stepped out of bounds before the fumble. Landry scored on the next play \u2014 a 1-yard reception \u2014 for his NFL-leading 112th catch.  After scoring, Landry charged toward Poyer, and their helmets crashed. A melee ensued, and Dolphins running back Kenyan Drake flung a Bills helmet. Landry and Drake were ejected.  The Dolphins kept coming, though.  With 1:56 left in the fourth quarter, Fales scored on a 1-yard run, closing Miami\u2019s deficit to 22-16.  Miami then recovered its fourth onside kick of the season \u2014 most in the NFL \u2014 but that was as close as it got for the Dolphins.  NOTES: Bills CB EJ Gaines (knee) returned after missing one game. ... Bills CB Shareece Wright (concussion) sat out. ... Bills G John Miller (ankle) missed his seventh straight game. ... Dolphins LT Laremy Tunsil (ankle) sat out for the first time this season.

Dolphins C Mike Pouncey, bothered by a chronic hip injury, started all 16 games for the first time since 2012. ...

          "body": "Steelers backups keep Browns 0-for-2017  PITTSBURGH \u2014 If the Pittsburgh Steelers thought a few early touchdowns against the winless Cleveland Browns would cause the visitors at frigid Heinz Field to pack it in, they were mistaken.  The Browns rallied, took the Steelers to the wire, but couldn\u2019t come all the way back for their first win.  The Steelers held on to beat the Browns 28-24 to make the Browns the second 0-16 team in NFL history. The 2008 Detroit Lions also went 0-16.  \u201cThis is going to stay next to my name, this organization\u2019s name, this team\u2019s name for the rest of our lives,\u201d said Browns head coach Hue Jackson. \u201cNobody wants that. I can\u2019t do anything about it. We tried. We didn\u2019t do it. We didn\u2019t finish. We\u2019ll wear it until we can take it off, but we\u2019ll take it off soon. I promise you that.\u201d  The Steelers jumped out to a 14-0 lead, but the Browns came back to tie the score at 21 early in the third quarter. However, JuJu Smith-Schuster\u2019s 96-yard kickoff return on the ensuing kickoff put the Steelers back up 28-21 and the Browns could only add a 51-yard field goal and fell short once again.  The Browns had their chances in the fourth quarter, but a fumble by Duke Johnson Jr. at the Pittsburgh 31, a DeShone Kizer interception by Sean Davis at the Cleveland 47, and a dropped fourth-and-2 pass by Corey Coleman at the Pittsburgh 11 kept the Browns from winning their first game.  Coleman had to feel like Dennis Northcutt, who dropped a critical pass for the Browns during their last playoff game, which followed the 2002 season here at Heinz Field. Jackson said, \u201cI\u2019ll put my arms around him and say, \u2018You have to make those plays,\u2019 and he knows that. It\u2019s tough. That play will be remembered.\u201d  The Steelers didn\u2019t sense any quit in the beleaguered Browns, who outgained the Steelers 374-348 and converted 6-of-9 third downs in the second half.  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel any of that from them,\u201d said former Browns and current Steelers cornerback Joe Haden. \u201cThey just kept pushing, kept fighting all the way to the end.\u201d  The Steelers started Landry Jones at quarterback in place of Ben Roethlisberger and Jones completed 23-of-27 passes for 239 yards and a touchdown in guiding the Steelers to their 13th win of the season. His passer rating of 100.5 was second in his five-year career to the 103.1 rating he posted in last year\u2019s finale against the Browns.  \u201cThey\u2019re still paying us. Everyone\u2019s still professional,\u201d Jones said of the group of Steelers backups who replaced five healthy starters. \u201cI think it\u2019s funny sometimes. I got asked a question the other day, \u2018Are they going to allow you to throw the ball?\u2019 Uh, yeah. They\u2019re paying me good money to go out there and do a job. I\u2019m not surprised about the outcome today. We\u2019ve still got good players on this team that can get it done.\u201d  Jones drove the Steelers 72 yards on the opening drive for a touchdown. Stevan Ridley, playing for running back Le\u2019Veon Bell, ripped off runs of 13 and 16 yards to set up wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey\u2019s 29-yard touchdown run on a reverse for the early 7-0 lead.  The Steelers increased their lead to 14-0 early in the second quarter with a 20-yard Jones touchdown pass to Smith-Schuster.  The score was set up by a partially blocked punt by Tyler Matakevich, whose blocked punt in the opener in Cleveland gave the Steelers their first touchdown of the season.  The Steelers took the 27-yard punt at the Cleveland 28 and Jones hit a wide-open Smith-Schuster for the touchdown on a third-and-2 play with 13:26 left in the second quarter.  Refusing to pack it in for the winter, the Browns cut the lead in half on their next possession, with the help of their longest completed pass of the season, a 54-yarder from Kizer to Josh Gordon. It set up Johnson\u2019s two-yard touchdown run, after which he prayed for and paid tribute to injured Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier.  Johnson\u2019s touchdown cut the Steelers\u2019 lead to 14-7 with 11:46 left in the half.  The Steelers answered with a 75-yard touchdown drive, capped by Ridley\u2019s four-yard touchdown run to push the Steelers\u2019 lead to 21-7 with 7:59 left in the half. A roughing-the-passer penalty by defensive end Myles Garrett on a third-and-2 incompletion cost the Browns when Ridley scored on the next play.  The Browns topped their long pass of the season two snaps later when Kizer found Rashard Higgins for 56 yards. The wide receiver was isolated on outside linebacker T.J. Watt, who fell and Higgins outran the Steelers\u2019 safeties for the touchdown that cut the deficit to 21-14 with 7:22 left in the second quarter.  The Browns tied the game on their opening possession of the second half. A 34-yard pass to tight end David Njoku set up a 5-yard touchdown pass from Kizer to Higgins, his second touchdown of the game. It tied the score at 21 with 10:54 left in the third quarter.  But Smith-Schuster returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown, the Steelers\u2019 first kickoff return for a touchdown since Antonio Brown in 2010. It gave the Steelers a 28-21 lead with 10:42 left in the third quarter.  A 51-yard field goal by Zane Gonzalez of the Browns cut the lead to 28-24 with 2:04 left in the third quarter.  \u201cWe fought for it,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cWe really fought for it. Everybody showed up playing with heart, showing resiliency, showed determination to go try and get a win to finish this season on a good note. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t get the W, but you could see how close we were.\u201d  NOTES: Healthy Steelers scratches included starting QB Ben Roethlisberger, RB Le\u2019Veon Bell, C Maurkice Pouncey, RG David DeCastro and DT Cameron Heyward. Out injured was WR Antonio Brown. ... Steelers K Chris Boswell broke the team single-season scoring record \u2014 previously held by Norm Johnson with 141 in 1995 \u2014 with four points to give him 142 this season. ... The Steelers broke their team sack record of 55 (1994, 2001) with six sacks to give them 56 this season. Tyson Alualu\u2019s second sack was the record-breaker early in the fourth quarter. ... Browns QB DeShone Kizer entered the game with the worst passer rating (57.9) of a starting quarterback since JaMarcus Russell\u2019s 50.0 in 2009. ... Browns S Jabrill Peppers made his first career interception in the first quarter and had his first career sack in the second quarter. ... Steelers C B.J. Finney left the game in the second quarter with an injured right thigh. He was replaced by Chris Hubbard, a tackle who struggled at times with shotgun snaps. ... WR JuJu Smith-Schuster caught nine passes for 143 yards and a touchdown. He broke Jimmy Orr\u2019s team rookie receiving yards record with 917. Orr had 910 in 1958."

          "body": "Balanced attack leads No. 25 Creighton past Providence  OMAHA, Neb. \u2014 No. 25 Creighton bounced back from Thursday\u2019s hard-luck loss at Seton Hall with an 83-64 Big East Conference victory over Providence on Sunday.  Marcus Foster led five Creighton players in double figures with 18 points. Toby Hegner finished with 15 points and Martin Krampelj had 13 points and a team-leading eight rebounds. The 12 points by Davion Mintz and 11 for Khyri Thomas meant the Bluejays\u2019 starting five finished with 69 of Creighton\u2019s 83 points.  Providence center Nate Watson led all players with 20 points, and Friars forward Rodney Bullock had a game-high 10 rebounds to go with 15 points.  The Bluejays opened Big East play with a 90-84 road setback to the Pirates after leading the game by 13 points early in the second half. Meanwhile, the Friars got off to a roaring start in conference play with a 22-point road victory over St. John\u2019s.  \u201cObviously we were all very disappointed with the last three minutes and the way we played at the end of the Seton Hall game,\u201d Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to turn the page fast, and to these guys\u2019 credit, we watched the film in the morning, then went to work on Providence. I thought we really executed the plan well.\u201d  Creighton (11-3, 1-1 Big East) broke open a tight game with a 9-0 run in the middle of the first half that turned a two-point lead to a 25-14 advantage. Providence (10-5, 1-1) went 6:18 between baskets and was 5 of 22 (22.8 percent) from the field for the first 13-plus minutes of the game.  After missing 11 straight shots, the closest the Friars could get in the final six minutes before halftime was six points (27-21). The one consistent offensive threat Providence had was Watson, who led all players with 13 points in the opening 20 minutes.  \u201cI thought we left a lot of points on the board in the first half,\u201d Providence coach Ed Cooley said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get it together. Six missed layups, we had nine turnovers in the first half. I thought the game was still in hand at halftime (but) they came up with a five- or six-(point) run and that kind of put us behind the eight-ball. We could never catch up.\u201d  Creighton went to the intermission with a 39-29 lead. The Bluejays were 15 of 31 (48.4 percent) from the field, and Thomas led the Jays with nine points.  The Bluejays scored three times in the first 1:04 of the second half to take a 45-29 lead. Providence couldn\u2019t get closer than 13 points the rest of the way as the Bluejays continued to push the offensive pace.  \u201cThat\u2019s been a thing with us, coming out the second half and letting teams get a little more of what they want,\u201d Bluejays forward Ronnie Harrell Jr. said. \u201cSo we were very conscious of keeping each other locked in and knowing that if we mess up on communication, easy things like that can lead to an easy bucket.\u201d  McDermott was pleased to see the strong break from the halftime gate that allowed the Jays to keep playing their style the rest of the game.  \u201cOffensively I thought we did a pretty good job when they didn\u2019t score on their first four possessions you take a 10-point game and make it a 15-, 16-point game right away,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cNow they\u2019re playing catch up. That\u2019s really important.\u201d  Creighton\u2019s biggest lead was 23 points when a 3-pointer by Foster put the Bluejays ahead 80-57 with 3:54 remaining in the game.  NOTES: The victory improved Creighton\u2019s record in Sunday home games at CenturyLink Center to 32-1. The last time Creighton suffered a Sunday home loss was Jan. 9, 2005, when the Bluejays were still members of the Missouri Valley Conference, to Southern Illinois. Creighton has won 36 of 37 Sunday home games since Feb. 4, 2002. ... In November, the Friars set a school record by making 9 of 10 3-point attempts. In Sunday\u2019s loss the Friars made just 3 of 23 (13 percent) from behind the arc. ... The Bluejays have started Big East Conference play 1-1 for the third straight season. A loss Sunday would have put Creighton at 0-2 in the Big East for the first time since 2014-15, the Jays second season in the conference. ... The Bluejays host St. John\u2019s Wednesday before traveling to Georgetown for a Saturday afternoon showdown with the Hoyas. ... Providence will play two home games this week, hosting Marquette Wednesday before welcoming Xavier on Saturday."

          "body": "Celtics pushed before holding off Nets  BOSTON \u2014 It wasn\u2019t easy, but the Boston Celtics managed to turn back the clock to a special time in franchise history on Sunday.  Boston held off the feisty Brooklyn Nets 108-105 to improve to 30-10 on the season, with the franchise reaching 30 wins at the earliest date since 1964-65.  In fact, it was the third-earliest arrival at 30 victories in team history. The 1959-60 team got there on Dec. 28, the 1964-65 group on Dec. 30.  Both of those teams went on to win the NBA title.  And now, the first try at win No. 31 comes with the Cleveland Cavaliers visiting on Wednesday night.  \u201cReally, really tough task (against the Cavs), obviously,\u201d Boston coach Brad Stevens said after his team failed to hit a field goal for the final 4:27 on Sunday but still hung on. \u201cThey\u2019ve had everybody\u2019s number in the East for a couple of years now, and we\u2019re amongst that list. So we\u2019ll see \u2014 we\u2019ll see whatever Wednesday (brings).\u201d  The final day of the calendar year almost brought pain as the Celtics actually had to repel the Nets (13-23) on four different occasions.  The home team, getting out to a quick 16-5 lead through 4:54, led by 13 in the first half, then fell behind for the only time in the game before a 12-2 third-quarter spurt re-established control. Back came the Nets again, and Boston used a 9-0 run to take over yet again.  Brooklyn, ending a 1-4 road trip, trailed 98-84 with 5:59 left but had a chance for a tie when Spencer Dinwiddie fired up a long bomb off an inbounds pass with 14.5 seconds left that didn\u2019t come close.  \u201cI think it was open, I think he could\u2019ve gotten closer,\u201d Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. \u201cI think if he curled it tighter, that was the play for him to come off that screen. ... I think they botched a switch or whatever and he came off. Even so, it was longer than we wanted but it was an open catch and shoot. So I told him take it, come off that thing and take it. Wish it was a little closer.\u201d  Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving registered his 11th straight 20-point game, scoring 28 points and grabbing eight rebounds.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give credit to just how talented that team is,\u201d Irving said of the Nets. \u201cThey play extremely hard for all 48 minutes. Well-coached, and he gives them the utmost confidence and freedom to play to their strengths.  \u201cA few great takeaways from this game, but especially down the stretch. We\u2019ve just got to close out better.\u201d  Marcus Morris finished with 15 points off the Boston bench. Terry Rozier, another reserve, had 14 points, seven rebounds and three assists, while Jaylen Brown scored 13 points. Al Horford had 10 points, 10 rebounds and five assists, and Aron Baynes contributed 10 boards.  Talking about Morris, Rozier said: \u201cIt was great. We\u2019re a team that has a lot of players that can play. You never know who\u2019s going to give you a boost off the bench, and tonight it was Marcus Morris. He lifted us a lot.\u201d  Rondae Hollis-Jefferson led the Nets with 22 points and 12 rebounds. Caris LeVert, playing his second consecutive strong game off the bench despite a hip pointer, had 16 points, seven assists and six rebounds. Quincy Acy scored 14 points, DeMarre Carroll and Crabbe both scored 12, Carroll grabbing seven rebounds, and Dinwiddie had 10 points and nine assists.  \u201cJust about your focus,\u201d Hollis-Jefferson said of the late rally that came up just short. \u201cI think it\u2019s your preparation that at the end of the day we prepared for this before the game. It\u2019s about being locked in.  \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll have a slip-up like we did at the beginning of the first quarter, but it\u2019s the overall outcome that you kind of want to base it on and we kind of stayed with it, we locked in. So give them credit, Boston\u2019s a really good team.\u201d  NOTES: The normally turnover-prone Nets coughed it up only once in the first half. ... F Jaylen Brown (knee) returned to the Celtics\u2019 lineup after missing two games while F Semi Ojeleye (back) remained out but was improved. ... Nets coach Kenny Atkinson on his team: \u201cListen, I think like a lot of mediocre to below-average teams, we\u2019re searching for consistency. That\u2019s the magic sauce we\u2019re looking for.\u201d ... The Nets came in with the No. 2-scoring bench in the NBA. The Brooklyn bench outscored Boston\u2019s reserves 46-43. ... Brooklyn comes off its five-game trip and opens a five-game homestand against the Orlando Magic on Monday."

          "body": "* Protesters chant: \u201cReza Shah, bless your soul\u201d, breaking taboo  * Rouhani says Iranians have right to protest  * Rouhani also warns against violation of public order  * White House says that \u201cvoices deserve to be heard\u201d (Adds White House statement, paragraphs 15-16)  By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin  LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Anti-government protesters demonstrated in Iran on Sunday in defiance of a warning by authorities of a crackdown, extending for a fourth day one of the most audacious challenges to the clerical leadership since pro-reform unrest in 2009.  Giving his first public reaction to the protests, President Hassan Rouhani appealed for calm, saying Iranians had the right to protest and criticise the authorities.  But he warned, according to official media: \u201cThe government will show no tolerance for those who damage public properties, violate public order and create unrest in the society.\u201d  Tens of thousands of people have protested across the country since Thursday against the Islamic Republic\u2019s government and clerical elite.  Police in the centre of Tehran fired water cannons to try to disperse demonstrators, according to pictures on social media.  Demonstrations turned violent in Shahin Shahr in central Iran. Videos showed protesters attacking the police, turning over a car and setting it on fire. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.  There were also reports of demonstrations in the western cities of Sanandaj and Kermanshah as well as Chabahar in the southeast and Ilam and Izeh in the southwest.  Demonstrators initially vented their anger over economic hardships and alleged corruption, but the protests took on a rare political dimension, with a growing number of people calling on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down.  Iranian security forces appear to have shown restraint to avoid an escalation of the crisis. Two people have been killed and hundreds arrested.  The protests were the biggest since unrest in 2009 that followed the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Videos showed people in central Tehran chanting: \u201cDown with the dictator!\u201d in an apparent reference to Khamenei.  Protesters in Khorramabad in western Iran shouted: \u201cKhamenei, shame on you, leave the country alone!\u201d  The government said it would temporarily restrict access to the Telegram messaging app and Instagram, owned by Facebook Inc , state television said. There were also reports that mobile access to the internet was being blocked in some areas.  \u201cIran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday.  The White House said in a statement later on Sunday that the Iranian people\u2019s \u201cvoices deserve to be heard.\u201d  \u201cWe encourage all parties to protect this fundamental right to peaceful expression and to avoid any actions that contribute to censorship,\u201d the statement said.  An Iranian reached by telephone, who asked not to be named, said there was a heavy presence of police and security forces in the heart of the capital.  \u201cI saw a few young men being arrested and put into police van. They don\u2019t let anyone assemble,\u201d he said.  A video showed a protester being arrested by police while a crowd shouted: \u201cPolice, go and arrest the thieves!\u201d in the northwestern city of Khoy.  In the western town of Takestan, demonstrators set ablaze a Shi\u2019ite Muslim seminary and the offices of the local Friday prayers leader, state broadcaster IRIB\u2019s website said. Police dispersed protesters, arresting some, ILNA news agency said.  Demonstrators also shouted: \u201cReza Shah, bless your soul.\u201d Such calls are evidence of a deep level of anger and break a taboo. The king ruled Iran from 1925 to 1941 and his Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown in a revolution in 1979 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic\u2019s first leader.  High prices, alleged corruption and mismanagement are fuelling the anger. Youth unemployment reached 28.8 percent this year.  Economic indexes have improved under Rouhani\u2019s government and the economy is no longer in dire straits. But growth has been too slow for an overwhelmingly youthful population, far more interested in jobs and change than in the Islamist idealism and anti-Shah republicanism of the 1979 revolution.  The demonstrations are particularly troublesome for Rouhani\u2019s government because he was elected on a promise to guarantee rights to freedom of expression and assembly.  His main achievement is a deal in 2015 with world powers that curbed Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for a lifting of most international sanctions. But it has yet to bring the economic benefits the government promised.  Ali Asghar Naserbakht, deputy governor of Tehran province, was quoted as saying by ILNA that 200 protesters had been arrested on Saturday.  Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said some of those arrested had confessed \u201cthey were carried away by emotions and set fire to mosques and public buildings\u201d, adding they would face severe punishment.  \u201cAfter giving thousands of martyrs for the Revolution, the nation will not return to dark era of Pahlavi rule,\u201d he said.  Police and Revolutionary Guards have in the past crushed unrest violently. The new protests could worry authorities more because they seem spontaneous and lack a clear leader.  Yet analysts say Iran\u2019s leaders believe they can count on support from many of the generation that took part as youths in the 1979 revolution because of their ideological commitment and the economic gains they have made under the government.  In apparent response to the protests, the government backed down on plans to raise fuel prices, promised to increase cash handouts to the poor and create more jobs in coming years.  \u201cWe predict that at least 830,000 jobs will be created in the new year,\u201d government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on state television on Saturday night. He gave no details. About 3.2 million Iranians are jobless.  Protesters also expressed anger over costly interventions in Syria and Iraq, where Iran is engaged in a proxy war for influence against regional rival Saudi Arabia.  \u201cBig protests in Iran,\u201d Trump said in a tweet earlier on Sunday. \u201cThe people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism.\u201d  Rouhani said the U.S. president had no right to sympathise with Iranians since he \u201ccalled the Iranian nation terrorists a few months ago\u201d.

Kim said it is imperative to lower military tensions on the Korean peninsula and improve ties with the South, adding the path to dialogue was open.  Kim said he will consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics Games to be held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February.  \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to show unity of the people and we wish the Games will be a success. Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility,\u201d Kim said.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said North Korea\u2019s participation will ensure safety of the Pyeongchang Olympics and proposed last month that Seoul and Washington postpone large military drills that the North denounces as a rehearsal for war until after the Games.

          "body": "Golden Knights win seventh straight  LAS VEGAS \u2014 The expansion Vegas Golden Knights will head into 2018 with a three-point lead in the Pacific Division after defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-3 on Sunday afternoon at T-Mobile Arena.  Center William Karlsson scored his first career hat trick and the first in team history and Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, Erik Haula and Jonathan Marchessault also scored. Goalie Malcolm Subban stopped 19 of 22 shots for Vegas (26-9-2), which added to its Pacific Division lead over the idle Los Angeles Kings (23-11-5).  Vegas extended its winning streak to seven games, longest in NHL history for a team in its inaugural season. The Golden Knights also improved to 16-2-1 at T-Mobile Arena and are 11-0-1 in their last 12 games, not having lost a contest in regulation since falling at Atlantic Division leading Winnipeg, 7-4, on Dec. 1.  \u201cObviously, this streak is unbelievable,\u201d Vegas coach Gerard Gallant said. \u201cThe guys are playing well, they\u2019re playing great hockey every night, and they\u2019re competing. We\u2019ve got points in 12 straight games. You just keep working hard and battling hard, we\u2019re getting some puck luck and we\u2019re playing good hockey.\u201d  Auston Matthews scored two goals and Patrick Marleau added one for Toronto. Frederik Andersen finished with 25 saves in net for the Maple Leafs (23-15-2).  Vegas bolted to a 3-0 lead in the first period. Bellemare notched his fourth goal of the season with a backhand under the glove of Andersen off a pass from Alex Tuch just 2:24 into the game.  Karlsson made it 2-0 at 4:17 with a one-timer from the right circle off a pass from Reilly Smith to finish a two-on-one break.  Haula scored his 14th goal of the season when he picked up the puck at center ice and then fired a wrist shot that defenseman Ron Hainsey appeared to screen Andersen on.  \u201cWe knew they were going to come out strong and fast and they did,\u201d Marleau said. \u201cIt was a matter of us not getting the puck in and getting our forecheck going. Once they start rolling it makes it that much more difficult to get things going the other way.\u201d  Marleau scored his 15th goal of the season early in the second period to make it 3-1 when he took a pass from right wing Connor Brown in front of the net and spun around and slid the puck inside the left post.  Karlsson answered at 8:26 with a one-timer off a Marchessault pass from the behind the net.  The Maple Leafs closed to with 4-3 on a pair of goals by Matthews over a 74-second span, the first on a wrist shot followed by rebound of a Morgan Rielly shot just 27 seconds into the third period.  \u201cI got a little scared actually when they scored that third goal in the third period on that first shift,\u201d Gallant said. \u201cMatthews and that line were unbelievable. They\u2019ve got great puck possession and they make great plays.\u201d  But Marchessault made it 5-3 off a pass from Karlsson after an end-to-end rush by defenseman Shea Theodore, and Karlsson sealed it with an empty-netter at 18:24, outracing Rielly down the right side and then diving and flicking his stick at the puck in the right circle.  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever skated so fast in my life,\u201d Karlsson said. \u201cI really wanted it. I just threw myself and I whipped my stick at it. It was a great feeling to see it go in. It was pretty surreal to see all the hats falling down. You dream about that your whole life.\u201d  \u201cIt was great,\u201d Gallant said of Karlsson\u2019s hat trick. \u201cHe made an unbelievable effort to get that third goal. He dove and knocked the puck in, so it was a perfect ending.\u201d  NOTES: C William Karlsson now has nine first-period goals this season, which ties him with Washington\u2019s Alex Ovechkin for most in the NHL. ... Vegas returns to action on Tuesday with a home game against Nashville while Toronto opens a six-game homestand on Tuesday against Tampa Bay. ...

Not only did the Pacers take advantage of that injury absence in a 23-point road win on Oct. 24 in Minnesota, but they also set a franchise record for field-goal percentage (.667).  The situation was reversed on Sunday, when the Pacers were without injured leading scorer Victor Oladipo, and the Butler-led Timberwolves scored the first 17 points in a 107-90 road victory at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.  \u201cIt was like deja vu,\u201d said Timberwolves forward Taj Gibson, who had 17 points. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have Jimmy when they beat us, and then they lose Vic when they need him in this tough stretch.  \u201cIn the NBA, nobody is going to feel sorry for you. You have to come in and continue to play hard.\u201d  Butler, who averages 21.2 points, scored a game-high 26 points while center Karl-Anthony Towns added 18 points, a game-best 14 rebounds and six blocks.  \u201cWe watched film the last two days of their win earlier in the year, and it definitely wakes you up,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt was good to get back at them.\u201d  The Pacers missed their first 12 shots while the Timberwolves hit eight of their first 12.  \u201cI think that was more turnovers than shots,\u201d Pacers coach Nate McMillan said of the one-sided start, during which his team committed five turnovers.  Without Oladipo, who averages 24.9 points, the Pacers shot just 38.8 percent (33 of 85) from the floor, their lowest percentage in a home game this season.  \u201cWe made shots, they missed some they normally make, (it was) probably a combination of those two things,\u201d Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. \u201cThey made a run at us. I think they got it down to five, but we built (the lead) back up.\u201d  The Timberwolves (23-14) have won six of seven and 10 of 12.  The visitors pulled away for good after the Pacers closed the deficit to 30-25 in the second quarter. Minnesota led by 11 at halftime and put the game away with a 38-20 third quarter to take an 87-58 lead.  \u201cWe just moved the ball well and our defense was phenomenal,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cEverybody was just really in sync.\u201d  The Pacers (19-18) matched their longest losing streak of the season at four games, the last three without Oladipo, who has a sore right knee.  Oladipo\u2019s replacement, Lance Stephenson, made just 2 of 9 shots and finished with five points.  \u201cOne game can get us back on track,\u201d Indiana point guard Darren Collison said. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer, you win one game, start feeling good about yourself and get back on a streak.\u201d  Third-year reserve guard Joe Young led the Pacers with a career-high 20 points. Bojan Bogdanovic scored 13 points for Indiana, and Cory Joseph added 10.  \u201cWe just got to get a better start, and I feel like we\u2019re going to get better at it,\u201d Young said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to come together as a team. We\u2019re going through a little adversity, but we\u2019re going to overcome it.\u201d  NOTES: Indianapolis native Jeff Teague, who signed with the Timberwolves after playing for the Pacers last season, was disappointed about not being able to play against his former team in his hometown, so much so that he dressed for warm-ups. The point guard, who averages 13.4 points per game, missed his second straight game with a sprained left MCL and is out indefinitely. ... Minnesota has won five of six on the road. ... In his first start for SG Victor Oladipo on Wednesday, Lance Stephenson had his first double-double of the season, including a career-high 15 rebounds. He then matched his season high with 18 points in his second start, a Friday loss at Chicago. He led the Pacers in rebounding the previous three games. ... The Pacers lead the NBA in 3-point field-goal percentage (.385) and are 15-5 when making at least 10 3-pointers in a game, but have lost the last two games at home despite making 10 3-pointers."

          "body": "Carrington helps No. 23 Seton Hall dump St. John\u2019s  NEWARK, N.J. \u2014 Seton Hall\u2019s recipe during the first two months of the season has been to get the ball down low to its 6-foot-10 center Angel Delgado and let him take care of the rest. On Sunday, the No. 23 Pirates used their perimeter game to turn back St. John\u2019s 75-70 at the Prudential Center.  Led by Khadeen Carrington\u2019s 24 points, Seton Hall (13-2, 2-0 Big East) converted 13 of 29 (44.8 percent) shots from 3-point range to win its fourth straight game and ninth in its last 10. Carrington made 5 of his 10 shots from long distance.  Desi Rodriguez added 23 points and nine rebounds, and Delgado recorded the 61st double-double of his career with 12 points and 12 rebounds. He also played the role of facilitator, dishing out a team-high six assists, many off a double-team to open outside shooters.  St. John\u2019s (10-4, 0-2) was without its leading scorer, Shamorie Ponds, who was out with an injured knee he suffered against Providence on Thursday. Ponds is averaging 20.1 points per game.  The Red Storm were led by Tariq Owens\u2019 19 points and career-high 14 rebounds. Marvin Clark added 18 points and Bashir Ahmed scored 16 points.  \u201cHe\u2019s (Ponds) is day-to-day,\u201d said St. John\u2019s coach Chris Mullin. \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, but I\u2019ve been injured a lot. I know a lot about that, and we\u2019re not gonna jeopardize his health.\u201d  Carrington\u2019s two free throws with 1:24 to play moved Seton Hall\u2019s lead to 72-65.  After the Red Storm pulled to within 63-62, the Pirates reeled off five straight points for a 67-62 lead with 3:38 to go.  St. John\u2019s put together a 15-2 blitz to get within 60-58 at the 7:07 mark with Clark igniting it with three 3-pointers.  \u201cI thought we got in a good rhythm midway through the second half,\u201d said Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard. \u201cThen Owens hit that three that went from 15 to 12. I give St. John\u2019s a lot of credit. They really battled. Defensively, without their guards, they\u2019re really long and tough to score on.  \u201cWe got beyond the arc early and you always worry, does that carry over? They did a good job of protecting the lane with Owens and (Kassoum) Yakwe.\u201d  The Red Storm blocked seven shots, four by Owens. They are sixth in nation, averaging seven blocks a game.  A quick eight-point burst over 1:08 brought the Red Storm to within 45-43 early in the second half, but the Pirates responded with an 13-0 run to move their lead to 58-43.  Seton Hall relied on blistering perimeter shooting in the first half, making 10 of 18 (55.6 percent) from beyond the 3-point line for a 43-33 cushion at the break. Myles Powell was 3 of 3 and Carrington was 4 of 7 from beyond the arc.  \u201cThey (Seton Hall) came out and made 10 threes in the first half, and a lot of teams would have got discouraged,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cWe maintained our defensive intensity and worked our way back in the game, and made some free throws when we had to.  \u201cPregame, I just wanted (us) to compete. That\u2019s all I wanted. I told them, \u2018If we come out and compete, we\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 That\u2019s what I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d  The Pirates took their biggest lead of the half, 36-29, thanks to five straight points from Rodriguez.  Carrington deposited two straight 3-pointers for a 31-26 Seton Hall lead with 6:05 left in the half.  Three straight 3-pointers, two from Powell and one from Rodriguez, tied it at 14-14 for the Pirates with 11:25 left in the half. They took the lead on a Rodriguez jumper, capping an 11-0 run.  St. John\u2019s grabbed an early 14-5 lead, with Owens scoring nine of those points. Seton Hall went 4:08 without a basket, committing five turnovers, three by Delgado, who was double-teamed.  NOTES: St. John\u2019s is ranked first in the Big East in scoring defense, field-goal percentage defense, blocked shots and steals. ... Seton Hall C Angel Delgado is second in the Big East rebounding and fourth in the nation in offensive rebounds ... This was the 98th meeting between the two schools."

Tres Tinkle scored 14 points, and Stephen Thompson Jr. added 13 and Drew Eubanks had 10 for Oregon State, which shot 41.8 percent for the game.  David Collette had 12 points for Utah.  The Beavers made five of eight field goals to start the second half and took 43-41 lead with 15:41 to go.  Oregon State pushed its lead to 51-45 on a tip-in by Ethan Thompson.  The Beavers outscored the Utes 19-7 to open the second half.  The Utes led for most of the first half thanks to their long-range shooting.  Utah made 10 3-pointers to just two for the Beavers in the first half, and the Utes led 38-32 at the break.  After Oregon State scored the game\u2019s first five points, the Utes made four 3-pointers during a 12-4 run.  Kolbe Caldwell\u2019s 3-pointer with 10:18 to go in the first half put Utah up 22-13.  The Utes were 10 of 17 from deep in the opening 20 minutes, while the Beavers made just 2 of 7.  The Beavers, who open Pac-12 play with three straight home games, host Oregon on Friday.  Utah returns home to take on No. 17 Arizona on Thursday."

          "body": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - World number one Rafa Nadal, who is struggling to get any match practice before the Australian Open, will play an exhibition event at Melbourne Park in the week leading up to the season opening grand slam, organizers said on Monday.  The 31-year-old Spaniard has not played since he withdrew from the season-ending World Tour Finals in London in November with a knee injury.  He had already withdrawn from an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi, this week\u2019s Brisbane International and another event in Sydney, citing a lack of time to properly prepare.  However, the 16-times grand slam winner will be part of the winner-takes all Tie Break Tens event at Melbourne Park on Jan. 10, five days before the Australian Open begins.  \u201cTie Break Tens is a great concept and we will see and play some exciting matches,\u201d Nadal said in a statement.   \u201cThe field is fantastic and I expect some tough competition which will be great for the Aussie fans.\u201d  The eight-man field includes Novak Djokovic, three-time grand slam winner Stan Wawrinka, Australia\u2019s Nick Kyrgios, and former world number one Lleyton Hewitt.  Each match is comprised solely of super tie breaks to 10 points. The knockout tournament provides a winner take-all purse of $250,000.  \u201cIt really will be an intriguing contest,\u201d Australian Open Tournament Director Craig Tiley said.  \u201cThese guys are all coming in at different stages of their preparation, but once their competitive instincts kick in, which will be almost instant in this format, there will be some absorbing contests.  \u201cRemember, there is not much room for error. You lose the tie break and you are out.\u201d  Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Rory Carroll"

          "title": "Retooled line leads Ducks past Coyotes",
          "body": "Retooled line leads Ducks past Coyotes  Anaheim Ducks coach Randy Carlyle only wishes every move he makes paid off as quickly and as decisively as the game-altering decision he made Sunday.  Cam Fowler scored the go-ahead goal midway through the third period, and a streaking Rickard Rakell scored two more goals, leading the Ducks past the Arizona Coyotes 5-2 in Anaheim, Calif.  Anaheim (18-14-8) won its fourth in five games but only its 10th in 21 home games.  Ducks goaltender John Gibson made 23 saves, and Anaheim got three goals in the final nine minutes.  Arizona dropped its second in a row and 10th in 12 games. The Coyotes are 9-27-5 at the midpoint of coach Rick Tocchet\u2019s first season.  Carlyle\u2019s pregame move of shifting Antoine Vermette from fourth-line center to right wing on the Rakell-Ryan Getzlaf No. 1 line paid off immediately. The three combined for seven points.  \u201cWe were trying to find balance in the lineup and put people in places where they\u2019re comfortable ... and can have success,\u201d Carlyle said. \u201cWhen you have as much depth as possible in your forward lines, you have a chance to spread minutes out. We\u2019re kind of a work in progress.\u201d  About five minutes after Arizona\u2019s Clayton Keller tied the score at 2-2 in the third, Fowler found himself undefended above the circles. He beat goaltender Antti Raanta at 11:51 of the third with a hard wrist shot created by Jakob Silfverberg\u2019s pass from behind the goal line.  Coyotes forward Josh Archibald backed off his coverage of Fowler as the teams battled for the puck behind the net.  Fowler said it was a case of simply shooting the puck hard rather than worrying about trying to aim it.  \u201cMy focus was putting it through him (Raanta) and not picking spots,\u201d Fowler said.  Tocchet said it simply was a case of the Coyotes making yet another key mistake at the wrong time.  \u201cWe had a couple of breakdowns and crucial mistakes at the wrong time and it\u2019s in our net, and that seems to be the story of this team,\u201d Tocchet said. \u201cWe have five or six chances and miss the net, and Fowler has one chance and, boom, it\u2019s in the net.\u201d  Silfverberg put the game away by scoring his 10th of the season with 2:47 remaining, with Fowler and Gibson assisting. Vermette added an empty-net goal with 57 seconds to play for his third point of the game.  \u201cIt was a lot of fun. They\u2019re great players and they make a lot of room,\u201d Vermette said of playing with Getzlaf and Rakell. \u201cI thought we fed off each other, finding lanes and making plays with speed. I thought it was a good night. ... You want to contribute and chip in and make an impact, and tonight we needed scoring.\u201d  Rakell opened the scoring with his team-high 13th of the season, off a shot turned aside by Raanta (21 saves) before deflecting off defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson\u2019s skate and into the net with 4:02 gone.  Arizona, coming off a 7-4 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday, came back with only its second goal in its last 16 power-play chances when defenseman Alex Goligoski, between the circles, set up Brendan Perlini at the top of the right circle for a hard shot that scooted along the ice and past Gibson at 11:04.  \u201cI tried to get it to the net quick and it slid all the way on the ice, but I\u2019ll take it,\u201d Perlini said.  As the Coyotes have done all season, they gave up a goal almost as quickly as they scored one. Only 43 seconds later, Getzlaf dug out the puck behind the net and fed Rakell, who was open in the right circle for a one-timer and his sixth goal during a five-game goal-scoring streak. Rakell has a team-high 14 goals.  Keller tied it at 6:52 of the third with Arizona\u2019s second power-play goal of the game, a deflection of Derek Stepan\u2019s shot after Stepan took the puck away from Anaheim\u2019s Adam Henrique. Keller has a team-high 14 goals and three goals during an eight-game scoring streak.  NOTES: Coyotes D Niklas Hjalmarsson, out since Nov. 28 with an upper-body injury, is practicing again and is close to returning, but did not play. ... The Coyotes played a road-heavy schedule during the first half of the season, but now return home to play the Nashville Predators (Thursday) and the New York Rangers (Saturday) ahead of their bye week. ... Arizona couldn\u2019t hold a 4-1 lead and lost its season opener 5-4 at Anaheim on Oct. 5, Rick Tocchet\u2019s first game as the Coyotes\u2019 coach. ... Anaheim didn\u2019t go on the power play until Coyotes LW Jordan Martinook took a hooking penalty 1:24 into the third period. ... The Ducks play their next five on the road."

          "title": "Wizards' Beal scores 39 in win over Bulls",
          "body": "Wizards\u2019 Beal scores 39 in win over Bulls  WASHINGTON \u2014 Based on how the Washington Wizards ended 2017, perhaps they can skip a formal New Year\u2019s resolution about stepping up their game against opponents with losing records.  Bradley Beal scored 17 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter, and John Wall had 21 as the Washington Wizards rallied past the Chicago Bulls for a 114-110 win on Sunday.  The Wizards (21-16) moved in front for good on Wall\u2019s three-point play with 29.4 seconds remaining for a 112-110 lead. Mike Scott scored 17 points for the Wizards, who ended 2017 with back-to-back wins.  Nikola Mirotic scored 21 points for the Bulls (13-23). Chicago had won 10 of 12 games since Dec. 8 with the only losses coming against Eastern Conference contenders Boston and Cleveland.  Washington entered Sunday as one of six teams with a losing record (9-10) against teams under .500. The other five teams have 12 wins or fewer on the season.  The Wizards\u2019 dynamic backcourt filled up the stat sheet to help avoid another maddening loss.  Beal sank 7 of 13 3-point attempts and came up one rebound and one assist shy of a triple-double. After Scott\u2019s jumper with 8:25 remaining gave Washington\u2019s its first lead since 6-5 at 94-93, Beal scored the Wizards\u2019 next 15 points.  \u201cThat\u2019s just being in the zone, being locked in,\u201d Beal said of fourth-quarter flourish from the field. \u201cI really wanted to win this game. That was a team that competed their tails off from start to finish.\u201d  Wall also had nine assists and four blocks. The Wizards are 7-3 since the point guard returned from a nine-game injury absence on Dec. 13.  Kris Dunn had 19 points and 11 assists for the Bulls, but he missed a jumper with 25.4 seconds remaining.  Chicago fouled Beal, who missed a pair of free throws with 19 seconds left, but the Bulls lost possession in the backcourt. Wall pushed the lead to four with two from the free-throw line with 9.1 seconds remaining.  Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 12 points for the Wizards, who finished 16 of 36 from beyond the arc. The Bulls shot 8 of 35 on 3-pointers and 46.7 percent overall.  \u201cI thought earlier we had some really good looks. They got out, they amped up their defense and really pressured us,\u201d Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said of Chicago\u2019s struggles from deep. \u201cThat was a part of it as well. Give them credit for amping up their pressure the way they did but early on. I thought we had some great looks. We just didn\u2019t knock them down.\u201d  Robin Lopez had 16 points for the Bulls, whose only losses in the current 13-game stretch have come on the road against Eastern Conference contenders.  \u201cI think we\u2019ve been unselfish, we\u2019ve been playing together, we\u2019ve been resilient,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe found a really nice formula right now, and I think what\u2019s good about it is that it\u2019s been consistent, for the most part.\u201d  The Bulls continued their surging ways in the first half with 38 points in the opening quarter and an eventual 12-point lead. Washington\u2019s defense improved from there. Chicago went 7 of 18 from the field in the fourth quarter while missing 6 of 7 3-point tries.  \u201cThat first quarter they moved us around. We couldn\u2019t stay in front of them,\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cWe\u2019re a good team when we get stops. We keeping harping on it and finally did it. In the fourth quarter, we got a lot of stops.\u201d  The Wizards rallied in the first half behind a small-ball lineup that included the 6-foot-8 Scott at center. Scott made all five of his field-goal attempts in the first half and scored 13 points as the Wizards trailed 63-59.  At the end, for once, they didn\u2019t trail a team with a losing record.  \u201cWe played hard,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cMuch has been said and should be said. We were 9-10 (against teams under .500) going into this game. ... We stuck with it. We kept battling. A couple of times it didn\u2019t look good, but we kept fighting and coming back with good defensive pressure and made big plays and big plays for each other.\u201d  Lauri Markkanen, Justin Holiday and David Nwaba each scored 11 for Chicago.  NOTES: The Bulls\u2019 bench outscored the Wizards\u2019 reserves 46-32. ... Wizards F Mike Scott returned to the team after missing the Friday win over the Houston Rockets for the birth of his second child. ... Bulls G Kris Dunn played 32 minutes after sitting out the Friday game with left patellar tendinitis. ... G Bradley Beal recorded his first 30-point scoring game since tallying 34 in Washington\u2019s Dec. 7 win at the Phoenix Suns. ... The Bulls kick off 2018 Monday in Chicago against the Portland Trail Blazers. ... Washington hosts the New York Knicks on Wednesday."

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts said on Sunday he would launch a review in 2018 of how the federal judiciary handles sexual harassment, following the recent resignation of a U.S. appeals court judge amid allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and comments.   In his annual year-end report on the federal judiciary, Roberts said the judicial branch of government was not immune to incidents of sexual harassment and addressing it would be a new challenge in the coming year.   Allegations of systematic sexual harassment and assault  that surfaced against movie producer Harvey Weinstein earlier this year galvanized women to speak out about instances of sexual harassment in the media, government and workplaces across the country.  Earlier this month, renowned San Francisco-based federal appeals judge Alex Kozinski, 67, retired from his lifetime appointment after over a dozen women came forward to accuse him of inappropriate sexual conduct or comments.  In a statement announcing his resignation, Kozinski said that while friends and family had urged him to stay on and defend himself, he could not \u201cbe an effective judge and simultaneously fight this battle.\u201d Reuters has not verified any of the accusations.  \u201cThe judiciary will begin 2018 by undertaking a careful evaluation of whether its standards of conduct and its procedures for investigating and correcting inappropriate behavior are adequate to ensure an exemplary workplace for every judge and every court employee,\u201d Roberts wrote in his report.   Roberts said he asked the federal judiciary\u2019s director of the administrative office to form a working group to examine the courts\u2019 practices and recommend necessary changes to codes of conduct, employee guidance on reporting misconduct and its own rules for investigating complaints.  \u201cI am sure that the overwhelming number have no tolerance for harassment and share the view that victims must have clear and immediate recourse to effective remedies,\u201d he wrote.

          "body": "Vikings win, likely end tenure of Bears\u2019 Fox  MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 While the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 defense remains rock-solid, there were a few flaws in their offense and special teams revealed during Sunday\u2019s 23-10 win over the Chicago Bears.  Luckily for the Vikings, they will have an extra week to work on those things before opening the playoffs at home in two weeks.  The Vikings (13-3) clinched a first-round bye with the win over Chicago and may have spelled the end for Bears coach John Fox, who is widely expected to be dismissed after his team finished 5-11.  Minnesota was dominating on defense, as has become the calling card of these Vikings, holding Chicago to 201 yards of offense \u2014 most of it in the second half when the result was no longer in doubt.  \u201cYou get to this point and have an opportunity to get a first-round bye is like winning two games if you can win this one,\u201d said Vikings defensive end Brian Robison, who had his team\u2019s lone sack in the game. With the Super Bowl set to be played in Minnesota, the Vikings are eyeing a playoff run featuring three home games.  \u201cIt was huge for us to be able to come back here in our place, second round of the playoffs and hopefully have a chance to play playoffs throughout here.\u201d  Vikings running back Latavius Murray had a pair of touchdowns, while quarterback Case Keenum was 21 of 29 for 189 yards and one touchdown. Murray had 111 yards rushing on 22 carries.  Bears rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, playing behind a patchwork offensive line, was 20 of 36 for 176 yards and was sacked once. He also gave up a safety.  \u201cMy hat\u2019s off to every guy in that locker room. They battled, they fought and we saw some more of that today,\u201d said Fox, who will be fired soon, according to multiple media reports. \u201cThe tale of our season is just not generating enough offensive points. The coaches did a good job of preparing, particularly on special teams.\u201d  Minnesota did what it could to eliminate any drama early, scoring touchdowns \u2014 both via 1-yard runs by Murray \u2014 on two of the Vikings\u2019 first three offensive possessions and taking a 14-0 lead in the second quarter. Chicago\u2019s offense managed just one first down in its initial four possessions, but the Bears special teams got them on the board when Bryce Callahan returned a Minnesota punt 59 yards for a touchdown.  The Vikings got two more points before halftime, pressuring Trubisky in the end zone and forcing the rookie quarterback to throw the ball away. He was called for intentional grounding, which gave the Vikings a safety and a 16-7 lead. It was one of seven penalties for 91 yards whistled against Chicago in the first half, compared to just 53 yards of offense.  \u201cEverybody was covered and I started to scramble a little bit and I was in the end zone,\u201d Trubisky said of the safety. \u201cI thought I had a guy as a check down, so I flipped it to him but it was a lineman, not a receiver.\u201d  Keenum hit Stefon Diggs in the back of the end zone on Minnesota\u2019s final play of the third quarter for a 15-yard touchdown and a 23-7 lead. Chicago\u2019s offense finally scored with 8:22 to play via a 55-yard Mike Nugent field goal. Trubisky led two sustained fourth-quarter drives for Chicago, but got no points when the Bears failed to convert on fourth-and-goal plays from the 6-yard line and from the 2-yard line.  \u201cI thought we played exceptionally on defense, the two goal-line stands and we did a good job in field position most of the day with special teams,\u201d Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer said after his team finished with the second-best record in franchise history for a 16-game season. \u201cOffensively, we started fast and then we ended up messing up a little bit, getting some penalties, so those are some things we need to clean up.\u201d  Minnesota\u2019s last bye in the first round came in the 2010 playoffs. The Vikings beat Dallas at home and then lost at New Orleans in overtime of the NFC Championship Game.  NOTES: The Vikings encouraged fans to arrive a minimum of 45 minutes before kickoff to ensure they could get through security. Despite the minus-11 temperature outside at the start of the game, all fans were required to open their coats for inspection. ... Chicago was without regular offensive linemen Bobby Massie and Josh Sitton. ... John Fox\u2019s record in three seasons as the Bears head coach is 14-34. His first season in Chicago was his best, with a 6-10 record. ... Bryce Callahan\u2019s punt-return touchdown for Chicago was the first of his career. ... Vikings FB C.J. Ham left the game in the first half with a neck injury and did not return. He had one reception for 1 yard in the game."

The AFC East champion Patriots wrapped up their regular season at 13-3 to secure the conference\u2019s top spot for a second consecutive season and the seventh time overall.  Dion Lewis totaled 133 yards (93 rushing, 40 receiving) and scored two touchdowns while Tom Brady completed 18-of-37 passes for 190 yards and two touchdowns for the Patriots.  The 40-year-old Brady came out of the game in favor of backup Brian Hoyer with 5:59 left in the fourth quarter.  New York (5-11) finished last in the AFC East for the second straight season and the third time in four years.  Vikings 23, Bears 10  Minnesota had a few flaws in their offense and special teams during a 23-10 win over the Chicago Bears, but the Vikings will have an extra week to work on them before opening the playoffs at home.  The Vikings (13-3) clinched a first-round bye with the win over Chicago and may have spelled the end for Bears head coach John Fox, who is widely expected to be dismissed after his team finished 5-11.   Minnesota\u2019s last bye in the first round came in the 2010 playoffs.  Steelers 28, Browns 24  The Pittsburgh Steelers beat Cleveland 28-24 to make the Browns the second 0-16 team in NFL history. The 2008 Detroit Lions also went 0-16.  The playoff-bound Steelers started Landry Jones at quarterback in place of Ben Roethlisberger and Jones completed 23-of-27 passes for 239 yards and a touchdown in guiding the Steelers to their 13th win of the season.  Colts 22, Texans 13  Indianapolis running back Frank Gore rushed for 100 yards on 24 carries to help lead the Colts to a 22-13 victory over the Houston Texans at Lucas Oil Stadium.  The Colts limited the Texans to 209 total yards and got a safety. Each AFC South team finished with a 4-12 record.  Jacoby Brissett completed 15-of-24 passes for 114 yards and one touchdown for Indianapolis.  Lions 35, Packers 11  Matthew Stafford threw three touchdown passes and also caught a two-point conversion as the Detroit Lions closed out their season with a 35-11 romp over the depleted Green Bay Packers at Ford Field.  Kenny Golladay had a 54-yard touchdown catch for the Lions (9-7) in what may have been head coach Jim Caldwell\u2019s final game with the franchise. There has been heavy speculation that Caldwell will not be retained for a fifth season.  Cowboys 6, Eagles 0  Quarterback Dak Prescott threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Brice Butler early in the fourth quarter and the Dallas Cowboys held on for a 6-0 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles at frigid Lincoln Financial Field.  Despite having already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Cowboys still finished with a winning record at 9-7.  After last week\u2019s ineffective performance in a 19-10 win over the Oakland Raiders, coach Doug Pederson opted to bring back starter Nick Foles against the Cowboys.  Foles didn\u2019t perform well once again, going 4 of 11 for 39 yards, one interception and a miniscule 9.3 quarterback rating.  Giants 18, Redskins 10  The New York Giants scored two touchdowns in just over two minutes as they topped the Washington Redskins 18-10 at MetLife Stadium.  New York quarterback Eli Manning made his 216th appearance, which ties Hall-of-Fame defensive end Michael Strahan\u2019s franchise record for the most games played in a Giants uniform.

That is exactly what took place.  Dion Lewis totaled 133 yards and scored two touchdowns, Tom Brady tossed a pair of touchdown passes and the Patriots locked up the AFC\u2019s No. 1 seed with a 26-6 victory against the New York Jets in arctic conditions at Gillette Stadium.  \u201cI mean, we\u2019re 13-3. That\u2019s the best in the AFC,\u201d Brady said after the victory. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re playing for, and that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d  Needing a win or a Pittsburgh loss among other scenarios, the AFC East champion Patriots clinched home-field advantage and the conference\u2019s top spot for a second consecutive season and the seventh time overall.  Only San Francisco and Denver have claimed more No. 1 seeds, with eight each.  \u201cIt\u2019s important, but it\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s important,\u201d Lewis said of having the No. 1 seed. \u201cWe definitely are happy to have home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, but ... you\u2019re guaranteed to have it just one game.  \u201cSo we have it for one game in two weeks that we know we are going to be home for.\u201d  New England begins its playoff push for a sixth Super Bowl championship on either Jan. 13 or 14 at Gillette Stadium.  Lewis rushed for 93 yards and had 40 receiving while Brady completed just 49 percent of his passes (18 of 37) to lead the Patriots.  The 40-year-old Brady came out of the game in favor of backup Brian Hoyer at the start of the Patriots\u2019 final drive with 5:59 left in the fourth quarter.  By that point, with the game easily in hand, Brady was happy to be off the field and done playing in the bitterly-cold weather.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a challenge, I think, for everyone \u2014 mentally, physically,\u201d Brady said of the inclement conditions. \u201cBut it was great to get a win.\u201d  New York (5-11) finished last in the AFC East for the second straight season and the third time in four years.  The Jets are on the outside of the playoff picture for the seventh straight season, with their last playoff triumph being a 28-21 win at New England in the AFC divisional round on Jan. 16, 2011.  \u201cWell, we are 5-11, record-wise, we are far away,\u201d Jets head coach Todd Bowles said. \u201cBut, you know, chemistry-wise we are there. We have a few pieces here and there that we will assess in the offseason. And you kind of go from there. Obviously, I think we have a building block that we\u2019ll go off of and we will go from there.\u201d  Jets quarterback Bryce Petty finished 19 of 36 for 232 yards. Five of those passes went to Neal Sterling, who had a team-high 74 receiving yards. Bilal Powell led the Jets with 46 rushing yards.  The Patriots outgained the Jets in total yardage 330-247 and held New York to 0 of 12 on third down.  \u201cThat\u2019s just due to being in third-and-long situations,\u201d Jets wide receiver Jermaine Kearse said of New York\u2019s third-down woes. \u201cIn those situations, it\u2019s hard to convert. We just have to get better there, focus and finish.\u201d  Five-time Pro-Bowl linebacker James Harrison made his Patriots debut after signing with the team on Dec. 26 following his release from the Steelers. Harrison had five tackles and two sacks, both on back-to-back plays to end the game.  \u201cIt felt really good (to play),\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIt was just rushing outside and they were passing a lot, so I had good opportunities to get around the corner (on the sacks).\u201d  Stephen Gostkowski\u2019s 21-yard field goal with 1:29 remaining in the third quarter accounted for the period\u2019s only score and extended New England\u2019s lead to 24-3.  Chandler Catanzaro\u2019s second field goal of the day, this from 35 yards out, brought New York within 24-6 at the 10:28 mark of the fourth quarter.  Eric Lee sacked Petty in the end zone for a safety with 6:04 to go in the game, making it 26-6.  The Patriots led 21-3 at halftime.  New England was off and running after receiving the opening kickoff, driving 75 yards on 13 plays to score a touchdown on Lewis\u2019 3-yard rush with 9:30 left in the first quarter.  After Catanzaro\u2019s 48-yard field goal made it 7-3 with 1:42 to go in the first quarter, the Patriots effectively put the game out of reach with a pair of second-quarter touchdowns.  Brady found Brandin Cooks for a 5-yard scoring connection at 4:14 of the second quarter before Lewis reached the end zone for the second time on another 5-yard pass from Brady with 20 seconds to play in the half.  NOTES: With the thermometer reading 13 degrees at kickoff, Sunday\u2019s game was the coldest regular-season home game in Patriots history. ... The Patriots passed out 65,000 hand warmers to fans before the game. ... Jets S Marcus Maye was ruled out with an ankle injury and WR Robby Anderson sustained a concussion on a hit in the third quarter. ...

          "body": "Gore-led Colts dispatch Texans  INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 At 34, Indianapolis Colts running back Frank Gore showed he still has a pep in his step even in the final game of a losing season.  Gore rushed for 100 yards on 24 carries to help lead the Colts to a 22-13 victory over the Houston Texans on Sunday. Each team finished with a 4-12 record. The Colts ended a six-game losing streak while the Texans lost their last six games.  Gore, who had 88 yards in the second half, finished 39 yards short of a 1,000-yard season.  \u201cHe\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Colts head coach Chuck Pagano said, before being fired shortly after the game. \u201cHe\u2019s simply amazing, poetry in motion. He\u2019s a warrior. He runs like a man possessed. To do what he did today, 100 yards. He eclipsed another milestone with 14,000 yards.  \u201cHe laid it on the line. They all did. T.Y. (Hilton), A.C (Anthony Castonzo), Jack Doyle and that quarterback (Jacoby Brissett), No. 7, coming into these circumstances. That guy is a warrior. He\u2019s a winner.\u201d  Gore became the fifth NFL player to rush for 14,000 career yards.  Pagano said immediately after the game he had not heard from Colts owner Jim Irsay or general manager Chris Ballard. Less than two hours after the game, the Colts later released a statement that Pagano has been let go after six seasons.  \u201cWe talked about finishing all week long and I\u2019ve never been around a group of guys, players and coaches, faced so much adversities, so many ups and downs, so many disappointing Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays,\u201d Pagano said before learning his fate. \u201cBut what a way to go out. They can walk out of here winners with their head held high.\u201d  Brissett, who was acquired from New England just befoer the season started, replaced starter Scott Tolzien in the opener, and started every game since. Andrew Luck missed the entire season with a shoulder injury. Brissett completed 15-of-24 passes for 114 yards and one touchdown.  \u201cThose five minutes in the locker room (after the game) were the best Christmas gift, New Year\u2019s gift, just to see the smiles and have the feeling of finally finishing.\u201d Brissett said  Brissett said the sentiment that Pagano stressed was to win for the team, not for the embattled coach.  \u201cWe want to win for us and end the season off on the right note,\u201d Brissett said.  The Colts limited the Texans to 209 total yards and got a safety.  Texans head coach Bill O\u2019Brien didn\u2019t want to address his future after the game.  \u201cI want to reflect on this one, think about improvements that need to be made and go from there,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI don\u2019t control that. I\u2019m the head coach. I have a boss and he controls everything. I\u2019ll meet with him at some point and we\u2019ll decide what direction he wants to go.\u201d  It was announced after the game that Texans general manager Rick Smith is taking a leave of absence to care for his wife, Tiffani, who is battling breast cancer.  The Colts went ahead 14-13 on Marlon Mack\u2019s 1-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. Earlier in the drive, Colts receiver Hilton and Texans cornerback Johnathan Joseph exchanged punches, drawing offsetting penalties  Gore had runs of 16, 13 and 8 yards on that drive.  In the fourth quarter, Colts tackle Hassan Ridgeway sacked T.J. Yates in the end zone for a safety to take a 16-13 lead.  Adam Vinatieri\u2019s 54-yard field goal pushed the lead to 19-13 midway through the fourth quarter. Vinatieri added a 22-yard field goal with 31 seconds left to seal it.  Yates completed 10-of-15 passes for 112 yards to lead Houston to a 13-7 halftime lead. He finished 14 of 24 for 137 yards and was intercepted on the game\u2019s last play.  \u201cI thought the guys battled hard,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI appreciate the way they fought.\u201d  The Texans took a 3-0 lead on a 52-yard field goal by Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn. The Colts took a 7-3 lead on the first play of the second quarter on a 6-yard touchdown pass from Brissett to Doyle.  Houston went ahead 10-7 on a 2-yard touchdown run by Alfred Blue.  The Texans added a 46-yard field goal by Fairbairn with 1:44 left in the second quarter.  NOTES: Colts CB Kenny Moore suffered a concussion in the first half. ... Texans WR Will Fuller V suffered a knee injury in the first half and was ruled out for the rest of the game. ... Texans WR DeAndre Hopkins was inactive because of a calf injury. It was the first game he has missed in his five-year career, starting all 79 games. Entering Sunday\u2019s action, Hopkins led the NFL with 13 touchdown catches ... Colts WR Donte Moncrief, who was a limited practice participant during the week, sat out for his fourth consecutive game with an ankle injury. ... Colts RB Frank Gore became the first running back to start all 16 games in a season at age 34 or older."

          "title": "Winless Browns join 2008 Lions as worst NFL team, going 0-16",
          "body": "(Reuters) - The wretched Cleveland Browns completed a season of complete futility when they lost again on Sunday, if only narrowly, which means coach Hue Jackson can go jump in the lake.  After Cleveland went 1-15 in the 2016 season, Jackson vowed that he would swim in icy Lake Erie if the team did not improve in 2017.  But improve it did not. Instead, the Browns pulled off the difficult feat of actually regressing, becoming only the second team in NFL history to go 0-16, joining the 2008 Detroit Lions.  \u201cLet\u2019s just be honest and put it out there, I\u2019m disappointed, I\u2019m pissed off, because I never saw this being this way in two years here, ever.\u201d Jackson said recently.  \u201cI made that statement (about swimming in the lake). I got to back it up.\u201d  Whether he does so during the frigid winter, or waits for balmier weather and warmer water remains to be seen.  Early on in 2017 it seemed the Browns would win a game or two. Their first seven games included four narrow defeats by three points, but a promising autumn subsequently gave way to a bitter winter of discontent and a series of embarrassing defeats, culminating in a four-point loss against a second-string Pittsburgh team on Sunday.   \u201cThis is going to stay next to my name and the organization\u2019s name for the rest of our lives,\u201d Jackson said after Sunday\u2019s game.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. We\u2019ll turn the page on this and move forward.\u201d  Not that the team\u2019s long suffering fans will expect much difference in 2018, even though the Browns, with the first and fourth picks in the upcoming draft, should improve if they make wise choices, a big \u201cif\u201d based on recent history.  The Browns have missed the playoffs in 15 successive seasons, and have just one winning season in that stretch, going 67-173.   So why have the Browns remained so perennially bad when their poor record has given them so many high draft picks?  The reasons are somewhat debatable, but some bad draft choices (and non-choices) have not helped, none more disastrous than overlooking Ohio\u2019s very own Ben Roethlisberger in the 2004 draft.  Big Ben instead went to the nearby Pittsburgh Steelers, and the rest is history (two Super Bowl championships).  On the other side of the ledger was the decision to take another quarterback, college football Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel, in 2014, with a view to making the quarterback the face of the franchise, only to watch him self-destruct with a series of off-field problems that left him unemployed two years later.  The quarterback issue still has not been solved. In the past couple of years the Browns have passed on the likes of Deshuan Watson and Carson Wentz, who have blossomed with other teams, while DeShone Kizer labored in his first season.  Coach Jackson is not immune from blame either, but owner Jimmy Haslam should ultimately shoulder most of the responsibility since he bought the team from Randy Lerner in 2012.  Hindsight is always easy, but it cannot be denied that Haslam has made some questionable decisions, not least putting together a front office that realized too late that jettisoning so many veterans in favor of young players who were not NFL-ready was a dubious strategy.

          "body": "Stafford leads Lions past depleted Packers  DETROIT \u2014 Jim Caldwell\u2019s job probably wasn\u2019t saved by the Detroit Lions\u2019 performance on Sunday. The Lions did save their most entertaining play of a disappointing season until the finale.  Quarterback Matthew Stafford caught a two-point conversion pass during the fourth quarter of a 35-11 romp over the depleted Green Bay Packers at Ford Field. Wide receiver Golden Tate threw it to Stafford after running back Ameer Abdullah took the snap and pitched it to Tate on the trick play. Stafford was wide open in the end zone.  \u201cWe practiced it a bunch,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cI\u2019m just happy (offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter) called it. Guys were fired up in the huddle that he called it. It\u2019s a fun way to end it.\u201d  Before he turned into a receiver, Stafford overwhelmed the injury-riddled Packers with his rocket arm. He threw three touchdown passes and completed three passes of over 50 yards. Overall he went 20 of 29 through the air for 323 yards.  It was a bittersweet day for the Lions, who were eliminated from playoff contention with a loss at Cincinnati the previous week.  \u201cWe won\u2019t be in the playoffs, but we had some things to play for,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cWe had a chance to sweep the Packers. We had a chance to finish 5-1 in our division. We had a chance to finish with a winning record. We work really hard at this and I\u2019m proud of the way our guys showed up and played.\u201d  Tate caught seven passes for 104 yards, including a 71-yard touchdown reception. Marvin Jones Jr. hauled in four passes for 81 yards and a touchdown. Both receivers exceeded the 1,000-yard mark for the season.  Kenny Golladay had a 54-yard touchdown catch for the Lions (9-7) in what may have been Caldwell\u2019s final game as head coach. There has been heavy speculation that Caldwell will not be retained for a fifth season.  Asked if he would be around the Lions\u2019 offices tomorrow, he responded, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d  If it was his last hurrah, the team gave him a nice sendoff.  \u201cThis is a group that has shown that they can deal with anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey focus together and play well together. They\u2019ll be fine. You can tell the guys have a great sense of one another, when they come together and play in a game like this and play well.\u201d  Ziggy Ansah led the Lions defense with three sacks.  Brett Hundley completed 14-of-24 passes for 172 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions for Green Bay (7-9), which finished the season on a three-game losing streak. Jamaal Williams gained 82 yards rushing and caught three passes for 31 yards.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t make the playoffs, we didn\u2019t finish strong, we didn\u2019t win our last two, we finished 7-9,\u201d Hundley said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you want and that\u2019s not what we wanted, so from here we\u2019ve just got to regroup and figure some stuff out and go from there.\u201d  Along with quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was placed on injured reserve prior to last week\u2019s shutout loss to Minnesota, Green Bay played without a large chunk of its top offensive players. Receivers Jordy Nelson and Davante Adams, running back Aaron Jones, guard Jahri Evans and tight end Richard Rodgers were all inactive.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t come out to play today, then the results showed,\u201d Packers safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come out to play today and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d  The Lions led 20-3 at halftime with the aid of three Packers turnovers.  Mason Crosby\u2019s 41-yard field goal gave Green Bay the early lead, but Detroit dominated the remainder of the half.  Stafford\u2019s longest completion of the season made it 27-3 late in the third quarter. He connected with Tate along the left sideline. Tate eluded cornerback Davon House near the 10-yard line to complete the 71-yard play.  NOTES: The Lions swept the season series with the Packers for the first time since the 1991 season. ... The Packers finished the season 3-5 on the road. It\u2019s the first losing road record since they went 3-5 in 2010. ... Detroit posted back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1994-95. ... Lions CB Nevin Lawson sat out the game due to a concussion. S Don Carey left the game in the first quarter with a knee injury. ... Green Bay placed LB Nick Perry (ankle, shoulder) on injured reserve Saturday."

The televised New Year\u2019s speech was the 40-year-old president\u2019s first year-end address following his electoral victory in May. Macron made clear he would tackle even potentially thorny domestic issues, like a new immigration law.      Macron, who left political rivals reeling when he won power barely a year after launching a new centrist movement, has already rattled his way through an overhaul of French labor rules, in spite of street protests and a pushback from unions.  \u201cI will ensure all voices, including contrary ones, are heard. But all the same, I will not stop acting,\u201d Macron said, seated a marble table in his office at the Elysee Palace. The formula of the speech was largely in keeping with the one favored by many of his predecessors, despite speculation Macron would seek to shake up France\u2019s New Year presidential rite of passage too.   With parties to his left and right divided or scrambling to regroup under new leaders, Macron will benefit from a window of opportunity at home to push through more reforms in 2018 as the opposition flounders, analysts say.   Macron\u2019s popularity ratings have recently recovered from a slump as he tries to carve out an international profile and starts delivering on campaign pledges.  But his next steps also carry risks as he seeks changes that could spawn more of a popular backlash than he has previously faced, including a proposed overhaul of unemployment benefits which aims to tighten conditions for these subsidies.

          "title": "Likud party calls for de-facto annexation of Israeli settlements",
          "body": "LOD, Israel (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party unanimously urged legislators in a non-binding resolution on Sunday to effectively annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, land that Palestinians want for a future state.  By enacting civilian law over settlements, the move could streamline procedures for their construction and expansion. That land is currently under military jurisdiction and Israel\u2019s defense minister has a final say on building there.  The settlers are subject to Israeli civilian law.  \u201cWe will now promote the recognition of our sovereignty of the Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank). ... We must begin to enact this sovereignty, we have the moral right and obligation towards our settler brothers,\u201d Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan told a meeting of Likud\u2019s Central Committee.  Netanyahu is not bound to follow the resolution. He did not attend the meeting, which attracted several hundred delegates including ministers, legislators and party officials. The Likud Central Committee is the party\u2019s governing body.  At least two previous Likud Central Committee decisions have been ignored by party leaders:  In 2002, it voted against the creation of a Palestinian state, but then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he would act as he saw fit and Netanyahu in 2009 voiced conditional support for the establishment of a Palestinian state in a landmark speech.  Political commentators said the decision might bolster right-wing support for Netanyahu, who could seek a public mandate in an early election as he awaits possible criminal indictments against him on corruption suspicions. He denies wrongdoing.   Although parliamentary elections are not due until November 2019, the police investigations in two cases of alleged corruption against Netanyahu and tensions among partners in his governing coalition could hasten a poll.     Most countries view settlements that Israel has built on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war as illegal. Israel disputes that and cites biblical, historical and political links to the West Bank, as well as security interests.  About 400,000 settlers and 2.8 million Palestinians live in the West Bank. The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital.  In 1981, Israel enacted civilian law on the Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria in 1967, a de-facto annexation of the strategic plateau. The move has not won international recognition.  Israeli settlements have been one of the main stumbling blocks in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that have been frozen since 2014. Efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s envoys to restart them have not yet shown any progress. Trump this month recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, reversing decades of U.S. policy.  Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Peter Cooney"

          "body": "Cowboys hold off Eagles  PHILADELPHIA \u2014 As the playoffs loom, the Philadelphia Eagles must find a way to fix their offense.  For the second straight game, the Philadelphia offense sputtered badly. If it happens in two weeks, the Eagles could be bounced quickly from the playoffs.  This time, the Dallas Cowboys blanked the Eagles 6-0 Sunday at frigid Lincoln Financial Field.  \u201cAs a whole, it\u2019s not exactly what we want,\u201d Eagles quarterback Nick Foles said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to build on and I\u2019m confident we will build on it.\u201d  Quarterback Dak Prescott threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Brice Butler early in the fourth quarter and the Cowboys held on for the shutout victory.  Despite having already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Cowboys still finished with a winning record at 9-7.  \u201cToday was not perfect by any means,\u201d Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett said. \u201cI thought we fought and battled.\u201d  Running back Ezekiel Elliott was a bright spot with 27 carries for 103 yards. It was an interrupted season for Elliott, as the second-year player missed six games due to a suspension.  \u201cI\u2019m actually sad that the season is over,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cI wish we were playing in the playoffs right now. I\u2019m going to use that as fuel for next year.\u201d  After last week\u2019s ineffective performance in a 19-10 win over the Oakland Raiders, head coach Doug Pederson opted to bring back Foles to start against the Cowboys.  Foles did not perform well once again, going 4 of 11 for 39 yards, one interception and a miniscule 9.3 passer rating.  \u201cWe as an offense expect to execute better,\u201d Foles said.  Third-stringer Nate Sudfeld started the second quarter and played the rest of the game. Sudfeld went 19 of 23 for 134 yards with most of the completions coming on short passes.  \u201cI felt confident before today that I could go in and do my part and help this team win,\u201d Sudfeld said. \u201cStacking some reps together is awesome. I\u2019m more confident than ever in my ability and I know that I can help this team out if they need me.\u201d  The Eagles struggled mightily on third down (2-for-11) after going 1-for-14 last week.  Though the Eagles already own home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, they had a chance at their first 14-win regular season in franchise history. Instead, they wound up 13-3 and were shut out for the first time since the regular-season finale on Jan. 3, 2010, a 24-0 loss at Dallas.  \u201cI know this whole locker room feels confident because of the body of work we have put in all season,\u201d Eagles defensive end Chris Long said. \u201cWe have stuck together and we continue to do so. We\u2019ll put in the extra work to get ready for the postseason.\u201d  The teams remained scoreless through three quarters and the stadium began to empty out quickly.  Then, the Cowboys took over at their own 1-yard line and marched 99 yards in 12 plays with Butler hauling in a 12-yard touchdown pass from Prescott with 12:19 remaining. Butler broke free from cornerback Rasul Douglas and went into the end zone untouched. Kicker Dan Bailey sent the extra point wide left, leaving Dallas with a 6-0 advantage.  Neither team could mount any kind of offense in the first half and the game was scoreless at halftime for the first time in the history of the Cowboys-Eagles rivalry. This was also the first NFL game to be scoreless at the half since Week 14 of the 2011 season when the Chicago Bears and Denver Broncos played.  The Cowboys and Eagles combined for 216 net yards, nine punts and eight penalties in the first half.  NOTES: Eagles CB Sidney Jones made his debut against the Cowboys. Jones was the team\u2019s second-round pick in the 2017 draft, but sat out the first 15 games with an injured Achilles. ... Multiple reports are linking Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz as the possible next head coach of the New York Giants. ... Cowboys WR Cole Beasley (illness) wasn\u2019t active for the regular-season finale. Beasley had 36 catches for 314 yards and four touchdowns this season. ... Other key players out for the Cowboys included LT Tyron Smith (back) and CB Orlando Scandrick (back). Both were placed on injured reserve. ... The Eagles rested a number of players such as S Rodney McLeod, RB Jay Ajayi, DE Brandon Graham, DT Tim Jernigan and DE Derek Barnett, among others."

          "body": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis in his year-end message said that 2017 had been marred by war, lies and injustice, and he urged people to take responsibility for their actions.  At his last public event of the year, an evening vespers service in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, the pontiff said that humanity had \u201cwasted and wounded\u201d the year \u201cin many ways with works of death, with lies and injustices\u201d.  While war was the most obvious sign of \u201cunrepentant and absurd pride\u201d, many other transgressions had caused \u201chuman, social and environmental degradation\u201d.   \u201cWe must take responsibility for everything before God, our brothers and our creation,\u201d he said.  While the pope did not mention any specific events from 2017, he had made his voice heard on many of the world\u2019s biggest issues over the course of the year.  In April, Francis condemned the \u201cunacceptable massacre\u201d of innocent civilians in a chemical weapons attack in Syria. Just a month ago, he visited Myanmar, where more than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya people have been forced from their homes and into neighboring Bangladesh, speaking with authorities in an attempt to mitigate the crisis.  The pope also sought to encourage peace in Colombia during a trip in September and lobbied U.S. President Donald Trump to address climate change issues in May. Amid heightening tensions between North Korea and the West, Francis expressed concern about nuclear arsenals.  At the end of the service, Francis walked across St. Peter\u2019s Square, stopping to shake hands and pose for pictures, as he paid a brief visit to the life-size nativity set up outside.

In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January.  When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress.  President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense \u201cdiscretionary\u201d spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection.  \u201cThe (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: \u2018We\u2019re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,\u2019\u201d Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program.  \u201cNow, Democrats are saying that\u2019s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don\u2019t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people\u2019s money,\u201d he said.  Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party\u2019s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt.  \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,\u201d Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS.  Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich.  \u201cThis is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we\u2019ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we\u2019re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,\u201d Crowley said.  Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or \u201centitlement reform,\u201d as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018.  In Republican parlance, \u201centitlement\u201d programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy.  Democrats seized on Ryan\u2019s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs.  But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown.  Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the \u201cDreamers,\u201d people brought illegally to the country as children.  Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits.  The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers.  Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. \u201cWe need to do DACA clean,\u201d she said.   On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said.  Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.

          "body": "No. 2 Michigan State steamrolls Savannah State  EAST LANSING, Mich. \u2014 No. 2 Michigan State certainly had one reason to be nervous about Savannah State despite its 3-11 record going into their meeting on Sunday.  For all its success so far this season, Michigan State at times has struggled to defend the 3-point shot, and seeing a Savannah State team that chucks the ball up from 3-point range early and often created some fears for the Spartans.  Sure enough, Savannah State got hot from the outside in the first half and was only down a point as halftime neared in front of what became a more nervous than usual home crowd on hand for the New Year\u2019s Eve matinee.  But Michigan State alleviated fears from there, ending the first half on a 14-2 run in the final 4:22 to gain some separation and then dominated the second half to secure a 108-52 win over Savannah State in the final nonconference game of the regular season for the Spartans.  Michigan State (14-1) won its 13th straight game since its only loss of the season to Duke on Nov. 14.  \u201cWe still have a lot of sophomores and freshmen playing, and we played like it for the first half,\u201d Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo said. \u201cHalftime was a teaching moment.\u201d  Thanks to eight 3-pointers in the first half, Savannah State led 20-18 with 11:17 remaining in the first half and was only down 37-36 with 4:22 left in the first half.  Savannah State entered the game leading the country in 3-point attempts with 563 and was third nationally with an average of 11.9 shots made per game from behind the 3-point line through 14 games.  \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard for those guys to get up for Savannah State and I think that\u2019s the only advantage we had in this game,\u201d Savannah State head coach Horace Broadnax said. \u201cSometimes you take smaller teams lightly.\u201d  But for the rest of the first half, Michigan State clamped down defensively and got into a better rhythm in its half-court sets, taking a 51-38 lead at halftime.  Michigan State\u2019s momentum continued in the second half, with the Spartans taking a 76-49 lead with 9:23 left and a 40-point lead at 92-52 with 5:55 remaining.  Sophomore center Nick Ward scored 21 points on 9-of-9 shooting from the field and added 10 rebounds, sophomore forward Miles Bridges had 19 points and a career-high 21 rebounds, sophomore guard Cassius Winston scored 16 points and had a career-high 13 assists, and junior guard Matt McQuaid added 14 points to lead the offensive onslaught for the Spartans.  \u201cThat was a funny team to play,\u201d Izzo said of Savannah State. \u201cThey shoot 3s from everywhere.\u201d  Michigan State\u2019s nonconference schedule was a success despite the loss to Duke.  The Spartans posted lopsided wins over North Carolina and Notre Dame to put on their resume, and with Villanova\u2019s loss to Butler on Saturday, odds are good that Michigan State will start the New Year ranked No. 1.  Michigan State now turns its attention to the resumption conference play attempting to win its first outright Big Ten title since 2009. Michigan State\u2019s last conference title in 2012 was shared with Ohio State and Michigan.  The Spartans will host Maryland on Thursday and are already 2-0 in conference play after a home win over Nebraska on Dec. 3 and a win at Rutgers on Dec. 5.  \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out where my team is a little bit just because of these last three or four games,\u201d Izzo said, referring to inferior opponents. \u201cNow we will know because this week things will change a little bit. We are looking forward to it.\u201d  Savannah State dropped to 3-12, although the game against Michigan State was the sixth time already this season the Tigers have played a ranked opponent.  Junior guard Dexter McClanahan had 14 points to lead Savannah State.  Asked how valuable the experience of playing another ranked team like Michigan State was, Broadnax joked that it was \u201csix-figures valuable\u201d before going on to say it should prepare his team better for conference play.  \u201cWe just ran out of gas,\u201d Broadnax said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to take a moral victory. The guys played well in the first half.\u201d"

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean authorities have seized a Panama-flagged vessel suspected of transferring oil products to North Korea in violation of international sanctions, a customs official said on Sunday.  The seizure was the second to be revealed by South Korea within a few days, as the United Nations steps up efforts to squeeze essential oil supplies to the reclusive North following its nuclear or ballistic missile tests.  The ship, KOTI, was seized at Pyeongtaek-Dangjin port, the official told Reuters, without elaborating, due to the sensitivity of the issue. The port is on the west coast, south of Incheon.   A marine official also confirmed the seizure, which he said was done \u201crecently\u201d.   The KOTI\u2019s estimated time of arrival at the port was Dec. 19, according to VesselFinder Ltd., a tracking service provider,   The ship can carry 5,100 tonnes of oil and has a crew mostly from China and Myanmar, Yonhap News Agency reported, adding that South Korea\u2019s intelligence and customs officials are conducting a joint probe into the vessel.  A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed the probe, declining to provide details.   \u201cThe government has been in close consultations with related countries and ministries to thoroughly implement the sanctions by the U.N. Security Council,\u201d the spokesman said.  On Friday, South Korea said that in late November it seized the Hong Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore, which is suspected of transferring as much as 600 tons of oil to the North Korea-flagged Sam Jong 2.  The U.N. Security Council last month unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.  The United States has also proposed that the United Nations Security Council blacklist 10 ships for transporting banned items from North Korea, according to documents seen by Reuters on Tuesday.  The Lighthouse Winmore is one of the 10 ships proposed to be blacklisted. The KOTI does not seem to be included on the list.   On Thursday, China blocked a U.S. effort at the United Nations to blacklist six foreign-flagged ships, a U.N. Security Council diplomat said.  China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, responding to a question from Reuters on the blocking, said Beijing always fully and strictly implemented Security Council resolutions.  \u201cAt the same time, any measures taken by the Security Council must have a basis in conclusive and actual proof. China will continue to participate in the work of the relevant Security Council sanctions committee on this principle,\u201d it said in a short statement, without elaborating.   China also denied reports it had been illicitly selling oil products to North Korea in defiance of U.N. sanctions, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was unhappy that China had allowed oil to reach the isolated nation.       Russian tankers have supplied fuel to North Korea on at least three occasions in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea, breaching U.N. sanctions, sources told Reuters.

          "title": "Congolese forces kill at least seven during anti-government protests: U.N.",
          "body": "KINSHASA (Reuters) - Security forces killed at least seven people in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday during protests against President Joseph Kabila\u2019s refusal to step down from office, United Nations peacekeepers said.  A police spokesman said three people had been killed in altercations with security forces in the capital, Kinshasa, and that two of the deaths were being investigated.    Catholic activists had called for protests after Sunday worship, one year after Kabila committed to holding an election to choose his successor by the end of 2017 - an election that has now been delayed until December 2018.   The delay has fueled suspicions that Kabila will try to remove constitutional term limits that forbid him to run again, as presidents in neighboring countries have done. That in turn has raised fears that Congo will slide back into the kind of civil war that killed millions at the turn of the century.  Florence Marchal, spokeswoman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, said security forces had shot dead at least seven people in Kinshasa. Another person was killed in a protest in the central city of Kananga, she said, although the cause of death was not yet clear.  U.N. observers documented at least 123 arrests across the country and a number of serious injuries, Marchal added.   In tweets, the U.N. human rights office in Congo condemned \u201cthe use of force against peaceful demonstrators\u201d and the \u201cviolent suppression of fundamental rights and freedoms by security forces\u201d.  Pierrot Mwanamputu, the national police spokesman, said one person had died in Kinshasa when security forces were attacked by young men, some of them carrying firearms and bladed weapons. He said the other two deaths occurred during an altercation and that the police had opened an investigation.   At the Paroisse Saint Michel Catholic church in Kinshasa\u2019s Bandalungwa district, security forces fired teargas into the building, creating panic, opposition leader Vital Kamerhe, who was present at the mass, told Reuters.   The police had banned the demonstrations and said that all gatherings of more than five people would be dispersed to ensure public order. Across Kinshasa, police and soldiers searched vehicles and checked passengers\u2019 identifications.  Authorities on Saturday ordered all internet and SMS services cut until further notice.  At the Notre Dame du Congo cathedral in Kinshasa\u2019s Lingwala district, where opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi was attending mass, dozens of police and soldiers blocked the path of more than 100 opposition supporters as they prepared to try to march.  But Tshisekedi, who had backed the activists\u2019 call to march, left the church in a vehicle, spurring angry shouts from the crowd, which said he was abandoning them.   At another church in the working-class district of Barumbu, a Reuters correspondent saw a few dozen police officers using teargas and stun grenades against some 300 churchgoers, who waved bibles and sang religious songs as they tried to march.  Some 40 percent of Congo\u2019s population is Roman Catholic and the Church, which has mediated in the dispute with Kabila, enjoys some public credibility, even though its leadership has not formally backed the protests.

          "body": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced a 40 percent increase to the minimum wage as of January, a move that will foment what many economists already consider hyperinflation in the oil-rich but crisis-stricken nation.      In his televised year-end address, leftist Maduro said the new wage level would protect workers against what he calls Washington\u2019s \u201ceconomic war\u201d to sabotage socialism.      \u201cGood news!\u201d said the former bus driver and union leader, speaking next to a Venezuelan flag in a midday address.      Most economists say the government is in fact fomenting a vicious cycle in a country already wrestling with the world\u2019s fastest inflation.  To counter those price increases, Maduro has been raising the minimum wage, but quickening inflation coupled with a depreciating bolivar currency has plunged millions into poverty.  Venezuelans will now earn some 797,510 bolivars a month, factoring in food tickets, or just over $7 on the widely used black market index. Millions will still be unable to afford three meals a day, while the increase is likely to stoke inflation further.    Prices went up 1,369 percent between January and November, according to figures released earlier this month by the opposition-led Congress, which estimated the 2017 rate would top 2,000 percent. The Venezuelan government no longer publishes inflation data on a regular basis.      Opposition politicians say Maduro\u2019s refusal to overhaul Venezuela\u2019s state-led economic model and stop excessive money printing will only create more misery in 2018.      Maduro, however, spent much of his half-hour address blaming others for the country\u2019s woes. He said foreign and local media were spreading \u201cnegative propaganda,\u201d while Venezuela was facing \u201cattacks\u201d on its currency and attempts to \u201csabotage\u201d its oil industry.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday.  Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference.  \u201cThis investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,\u201d Graham said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation news program.  \u201cAnd we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he\u2019s the right guy at the right time.\u201d   The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump\u2019s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller\u2019s team of bias against the Republican president.  Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was \u201cgoing to be fair.\u201d     Russia\u2019s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.   Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election.  Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI\u2019s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller\u2019s inquiry.    On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.   \u201cI want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,\u201d Graham said.  But he said the Russia investigation must continue. \u201cAs a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,\u201d he said.

          "title": "Trump, Republican allies endorse Iranian protesters",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers offered implicit support on Sunday to tens of thousands of Iranians protesting against the Islamic Republic\u2019s unelected clerical elite and Iranian foreign policy in the Middle East.  \u201cBig protests in Iran,\u201d Trump said in a tweet from his private club in Palm Beach, Florida. \u201cThe people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism.  \u201cLooks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!\u201d   Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said in a statement: \u201cThe Iranian government is being tested by its own citizens. We pray that freedom and human rights will carry the day.\u201d  The protests, which initially focused on economic hardships but now include anti-government messages, appeared to resume for a fourth day on Sunday despite Tehran\u2019s warnings of a crackdown and restrictions on messaging apps used by the demonstrators.  The protests are the biggest since unrest in 2009 that followed the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Trump\u2019s endorsement of some of the protesters\u2019 aims differs from how his predecessor, Barack Obama, initially reacted to the widespread \u201cGreen Movement\u201d demonstrations that rocked Iran in 2009.  Obama at first muted his response, fearing that support from Washington could backfire and allow the Iranian government to paint the protesters as tools of the United States.  Some Iranian officials already are blaming \u201cforeign agents\u201d for the latest unrest.  Trump has taken a more hawkish line with Tehran than Obama. In October, he refused to certify that Iran was complying with its 2015 nuclear deal, even though international weapons inspectors said it was.  He also has pledged to work with Gulf Arab states and Israel to curb what they say are Iran\u2019s attempts to extend its influence in the region.

Tens of thousands of people have protested across the country since Thursday against the Islamic Republic\u2019s unelected clerical elite and Iranian foreign policy in the region.

          "body": "KINSHASA (Reuters) - Security forces killed at least seven people in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday during protests against President Joseph Kabila\u2019s refusal to step down from office, United Nations peacekeepers said.  A police spokesman said three people had been killed in altercations with security forces in the capital, Kinshasa, and that two of the deaths were being investigated.    Catholic activists had called for protests after Sunday worship, one year after Kabila committed to holding an election to choose his successor by the end of 2017 - an election that has now been delayed until December 2018.   The delay has fueled suspicions that Kabila will try to remove constitutional term limits that forbid him to run again, as presidents in neighboring countries have done. That in turn has raised fears that Congo will slide back into the kind of civil war that killed millions at the turn of the century.  Florence Marchal, spokeswoman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, said security forces had shot dead at least seven people in Kinshasa. Another person was killed in a protest in the central city of Kananga, she said, although the cause of death was not yet clear.  U.N. observers documented at least 123 arrests across the country and a number of serious injuries, Marchal added.   In tweets, the U.N. human rights office in Congo condemned \u201cthe use of force against peaceful demonstrators\u201d and the \u201cviolent suppression of fundamental rights and freedoms by security forces\u201d.  Pierrot Mwanamputu, the national police spokesman, said one person had died in Kinshasa when security forces were attacked by young men, some of them carrying firearms and bladed weapons. He said the other two deaths occurred during an altercation and that the police had opened an investigation.   At the Paroisse Saint Michel Catholic church in Kinshasa\u2019s Bandalungwa district, security forces fired teargas into the building, creating panic, opposition leader Vital Kamerhe, who was present at the mass, told Reuters.   The police had banned the demonstrations and said that all gatherings of more than five people would be dispersed to ensure public order. Across Kinshasa, police and soldiers searched vehicles and checked passengers\u2019 identifications.  Authorities on Saturday ordered all internet and SMS services cut until further notice.  At the Notre Dame du Congo cathedral in Kinshasa\u2019s Lingwala district, where opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi was attending mass, dozens of police and soldiers blocked the path of more than 100 opposition supporters as they prepared to try to march.  But Tshisekedi, who had backed the activists\u2019 call to march, left the church in a vehicle, spurring angry shouts from the crowd, which said he was abandoning them.   At another church in the working-class district of Barumbu, a Reuters correspondent saw a few dozen police officers using teargas and stun grenades against some 300 churchgoers, who waved bibles and sang religious songs as they tried to march.  Some 40 percent of Congo\u2019s population is Roman Catholic and the Church, which has mediated in the dispute with Kabila, enjoys some public credibility, even though its leadership has not formally backed the protests.

Tamil Nadu, which accounts for the bulk of India\u2019s automobile exports, has been in political limbo since the death of Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa in December 2016. Jayalalithaa was a popular actress before joining politics.  Rajinikanth, called the \u201csuperstar\u201d by his fans, enters the  political scene at a time Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s party is looking to make inroads into the southern state that\u2019s been ruled by two south Indian parties for decades.  Over the past five decades, Tamil Nadu has chosen between the two Dravidian parties, both of which claim anti-caste social justice and secularism as their core ideology.  Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not win a seat in Tamil Nadu\u2019s 2016 elections. The next state election is due in 2021.  \u201cI\u2019ll push for spiritual politics without caste or religious leanings,\u201d Rajinikanth said. \u201cIf I come to power and am not able to deliver in three years, I\u2019ll resign. Democracy is in a state of distress in the state.\u201d  In Tamil cinema, Rajinikanth often plays larger-than-life characters that project him as a savior of the masses. The actor, who has been in a few Hindi movies, has created a frenzy among fans ahead of every release.  But opponents say politics would be different.  Subramanian Swamy, a BJP leader, dismissed Rajinikanth\u2019s plunge into politics as \u201cmedia hype\u201d.  Tamil Nadu, a state of more than 70 million people, is sometimes called the \u201cDetroit of Asia\u201d.

The 24-year-old, who struggled with a back injury last season, claimed the first set 6-3 before Cornet prevailed by the same score in the second to force the decider in the all-French encounter.  Garcia appeared to be suffering from some discomfort and took a medical timeout before the final set. She tried to hit a couple of serves before deciding she could not continue and retired in tears.  \u201cI\u2019ve always had some issues with my back,\u201d Garcia told reporters.  \u201cAt the beginning of the match I felt a pain in my lower back and it was different than it is normally. It was getting worse and worse and in the end I couldn\u2019t really move. There was no point to keep going.\u201d   She was hopeful the injury would not affect her Australian Open prospects next month.  \u201cI mean, it\u2019s in two weeks, so it\u2019s a long time... with the back it\u2019s always complicated,\u201d she added. \u201cEspecially mine, it\u2019s really something I take care of, so it\u2019s kind of surprising for it to show up like this. But we\u2019ll do the best that we can.\u201d  Cornet will met Mirjana Lucic-Baroni in the second round after the Croatian, who travels full-time with her daughter, overcame Germany\u2019s Tatjana Maria 6-4 4-6 6-0.  \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for Caroline. I know what it\u2019s like to have back pain,\u201d Cornet, who went down to Karolina Pliskova in last year\u2019s final, said in a courtside interview.  \u201cI hope she recovers for the next tournament in the Australian Open. I cannot say I\u2019m glad to be through this way, but the adventure continues for me.   \u201cLast year, I had a super run to the final and I have very good memories.

          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s Nippon Life Insurance Co [NPNLI.UL], which recently struck a deal to buy about a quarter of U.S. investment firm TCW Group, is scouting for opportunities to buy boutique managers of bonds and alternative assets, its president said.  \u201cAsset management is a business that can generate synergy with life insurance and it needs to be operated globally. We have been looking widely for potential partners,\u201d Yoshinobu Tsutsui told Reuters in an interview.  The bulking up of asset management overseas by Japan\u2019s largest private-sector life insurer comes as the nation\u2019s insurers are increasingly shifting money away from Japanese government bonds (JGBs), their main investment, into riskier but higher-yielding ones such as foreign corporate bonds to diversify their returns.  Insurers in Japan have been hurt by diminishing investment returns after the Bank of Japan launched aggressive monetary easing in April 2013.  In December, Nippon Life announced a deal to acquire 24.75 percent of TCW from private equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O). Nippon Life has about 74 trillion yen ($653.25 billion) in assets.  Tsutsui said potential targets are likely to be asset management companies with bond investment expertise, as the insurer\u2019s portfolio has been traditionally made up of fixed-income products.  He also said the company is looking for specialists in alternative investments, whose real estate and other portfolios offer diversification from conventional bond and stock investments.  \u201cAs we have to diversify investment assets globally, alternative is a very important field,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States has a very big and deep market for asset management. There are huge companies but there are also small but unique boutiques. We would like to keep looking there,\u201d he said.  Tsutsui said while his company will curb fresh investment in JGBs further, U.S. interest rate rises pose a challenge to its effort to increase foreign bond holdings.  \u201cHedging costs will rise with U.S. rate increases, that will diminish returns (from U.S. Treasuries),\u201d he said. Japanese insurers usually hedge against currency swings when they buy foreign assets to protect their yen-denominated value.   \u201cThere is an issue of how to build foreign bond portfolios and French government bonds are in the spotlight now,\u201d said Tsutsui, 63, who took over the helm of the company in 2011.  Sources with the direct knowledge have said Nippon Life is in talks to buy a majority stake in the Japanese unit of U.S.-based MassMutual Financial Group in an attempt to boost its bancassurance sales.  Tsutsui declined to confirm the MassMutual talks but said his company has been searching for ways to build up domestic sales channels in addition to traditional door-to-door sales representatives.  \u201cFor bank branch sales channel, we are thinking about mergers and acquisitions,\u201d he said.

Nearly 450 couples gathered in a large tent in the city center just hours before midnight to pray with their families before signing marriage certificates. Government officials oversaw each brief ceremony.   \u201cWe wanted an unforgettable experience and we\u2019re so happy that we decided to participate today,\u201d said Hartiningish, a 38-year-old East Javanese bride, while a live band played a set of traditional and pop music in the background.   Her husband, Ricky Rangga, 30, said the couple was grateful to the city administration for making the wedding possible.  Many couples wore matching colors and colorful traditional Indonesian outfits, with some brides donning elaborate headdresses and grooms carrying traditional daggers called keris.  Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan congratulated those taking the plunge and said the city would now host the event every New Year\u2019s Eve. The city government raised donation funds to pay for token gold dowries for the couples to exchange.   Grooms in Indonesia traditionally present gold jewelry or money to brides on the wedding day.  \u201cWe\u2019re planning to do this every year,\u201d Baswedan said, after posing for photographs with some couples.  Security was tight around the event\u2019s venue in the heart of the city, which took place just a few meters from the site of a militant attack in January 2016, when Islamic State-linked radicals killed four people using guns and bombs.   Tens of thousands of police and military personnel have been deployed in Jakarta and across the country to safeguard holiday celebrations as the country remains on high alert.  One young pair from west Jakarta said they were looking forward to their honeymoon in the holiday island of Bali, where an active volcano, Mount Agung, remains on alert for an imminent eruption.  \u201cIf we\u2019re together, there\u2019s no need to be afraid of (the volcano), we will just enjoy,\u201d Ruri Nurhayati, 22, said, just minutes after marrying her partner Andrianus, who goes by one name.

Police said they did not know the cause of the crash, nor the identities of the five passengers, but were speaking with several witnesses who were in boats on one of the waterways\u2019 busiest days of the year. The pilot was the sixth victim.  Several Australian media reported that four of the victims were British nationals, although that was not immediately confirmed by police.

More than 119,000 came to Italy by boat this year after a record 181,000 made the crossing in 2016, the ministry said in a statement. Since July, arrivals have declined by more than two thirds versus a year earlier.  \u201cWe were able to govern the flow because we were the first to believe that an agreement with Libya was a turning point,\u201d Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Corriere della Sera, commenting on the decline.  In February, Italy signed an agreement with the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, promising aid, equipment and training in exchange for its help in fighting people smuggling. The deal was endorsed by the European Union.  Since then, armed groups supported by the Tripoli government have forced smugglers in the city of Sabratha - a key hub on the western coast - to stop sending out boats. Italy has also bolstered the Libyan coastguard\u2019s ability to turn back boats.  But rights groups and humanitarian organizations operating rescue ships in the Mediterranean have criticized the policy, saying that it traps migrants in a country where they face appalling treatment, including rape, torture and forced labor.    While criticized by some, the figures are considered good news for the ruling Democratic Party (PD) ahead of a national election in March. More than 600,000 migrants have reached Italy by boat over the past four years, making immigration a hot-button political issue.   More than 20,000 are estimated to have died attempting the crossing to Italy, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates, making it the deadliest border for migrants in the world.  But deaths at sea have declined as well, according to the IOM, with 2,833 this year, down more than 38 percent from 4,581 last year.    Reporting by Steve Scherer; Editing by Gareth Jones"

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, under mounting pressure after three months of failing to form a new conservative-led coalition, vowed on Sunday to address growing social divisions.  In her annual New Year\u2019s address, Merkel promised increased investment in security and defense, improved health care and education, and efforts to overcome growing urban-rural disparities.  \u201cThe world won\u2019t wait for us. We must create the conditions now that ensure that Germany continues to prosper in 10, 15 years,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Germany will only prosper if its success serves all people and improves and enriches our lives.\u201d  Merkel, seeking a fourth term in office, is trying to  persuade the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) to extend the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that has ruled for the past four years, even though both blocs suffered big losses in September\u2019s election.   Party leaders will meet on Jan. 3, with exploratory talks scheduled from Jan. 7 to 12.   Former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, now president of the lower house of parliament, on Saturday said he could not rule out a minority government if no deal emerged.  The mainstream parties fear that a new election could hand further gains to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has entered parliament for the first time amid concerns about Merkel\u2019s decision in 2015 to welcome over a million mainly Muslim migrants to Germany.

          "body": "SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Four Indian paramilitary policemen and two militants were killed in a gunbattle that ensued after militants stormed into a police training center in Kashmir on Sunday, a police official said.   At least two militants entered the building at around 2:30 a.m. at Letpora, south of Srinagar, Rajesh Yadhav, a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) spokesman told Reuters.  The militants fired indiscriminately and lobbed grenades before heading into the center, Yadhav said.   He said two militants and four police were killed in the gunbattle.  SN Srinvastav, special director general of the CRPF, said that there could be one or more militants still hiding.  \u201cWe hope that we will conclude the operation as soon as possible\u201d, he said.  S P Vaid, director general of Jammu and Kashmir police, said that a search operation was going on, adding that they had received tip-offs about an impending militant strike in the Kashmir for the past three days.   \u201cThey (militants) were trying. They probably could not get a place and time earlier. So, they struck last night,\u201d Vaid said.  Militants have targeted police camps in Kashmir in recent months. Eight Indian police officials were killed when Jaish-e-Mohammad militants attacked a security camp in southern Kashmir in August.  Indian troops have killed 206 militants this year, Vaid said. Last year\u2019s total was 150.  India accuses Pakistan of training and arming militants and helping them infiltrate across the Line of Control that divides Kashmir. Pakistan denies those allegations.  The South Asian neighbors have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part.

Mitsubishi Aircraft said the order has not yet been canceled.  Overall, the Mitsubishi unit has orders for 233 of the 90-seat aircraft, the company has said previously, and aims to sell more than 1,000 of the planes over two decades.  Buyers such as ANA Holdings (9202.T) have said they have no plans to cancel orders despite the delays.

          "body": "CARACAS (Reuters) - A former oil minister excoriated Venezuelan President NicolasMaduro in a newspaper column on Sunday, accusing the leftist leader of behaving like biblical King Herod and plunging the oil-rich nation into economic devastation.      Rafael Ramirez, who was the all-powerful head of the oil ministry and state energy company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] for a decade, has long been a rival of Maduro.      In recent months, Ramirez has grown increasingly critical of Maduro\u2019s handling of a fourth straight year of recession that has triggered malnutrition, widespread food and medicine shortages, the world\u2019s steepest inflation, and a surge in emigration.      A furious Maduro ordered Ramirez to resign as the nation\u2019s United Nations ambassador in New York last month after an article entitled the \u201cThe Storm\u201d was perceived as an attack on his government.  Ramirez fled the United States in December for an undisclosed location before Venezuela\u2019s state prosecutor accused him of corruption during the time he commanded the world\u2019s largest crude reserves.      In his sharpest critique to date, Ramirez on Sunday published a 3,000-word column in local newspaper Panorama, comparing Maduro to Herod, the Roman-appointed king of Judea who was accused of mass infanticide.      \u201cYou are killing the revolution,\u201d Ramirez wrote, without  using Maduro\u2019s name.      \u201cWith a mix of arrogance, ignorance, incompetence, cynicism, and a lot of irresponsibility, you have brought our people to an unimaginable level of suffering and humiliation,\u201d he added, also accusing Maduro\u2019s inner circle of corruption and authoritarianism.      \u201cIf our Commander (late leader Hugo Chavez) were with us, standing in line for food, or walking the streets of Caracas seeing children looking through garbage, what would he do?

The political opposition says Ramirez is a hypocrite who is also responsible for Venezuela\u2019s economic meltdown. They say he destroyed PDVSA by filling the company\u2019s roster with political loyalists and letting at least $11 billion go \u201cmissing\u201d during his tenure.      Insiders say accusations against Ramirez stem from a turf war among ruling Socialists, especially ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election, rather than a real desire to root out graft.      In recent months authorities have spearheaded an anti-graft purge of the oil sector, jailing 69 top managers including two former oil ministers. Critics say the arrests are designed to consolidate the unpopular Maduro\u2019s control of the industry which brings in over 90 percent of foreign currency.      In the latest development, anti-government union leader Ivan Freites, who frequently gave information about problems at Venezuela\u2019s ailing refineries, said on Twitter over the weekend he had been summoned by intelligence agents. Political sources said he had left the country.     Reuters was unable to verify the information or contact Freites.      In his article, Ramirez urged top government officials to speak out against Maduro\u2019s purge before it is too late.    \u201cToday it\u2019s me, tomorrow it will be you,\u201d Ramirez wrote.

          "body": "(Repeating story sent earlier to additional subscribers)  * Initial evidence indicates sprinklers failed-investigator  * Mall alarm was not connected to SSI offices-investigator  * Investigator says few SSI staff attended last fire drill  * SSI says impartial probe will show it complied with rules  * SSI says cooperating with government agencies in investigation  By Neil Jerome Morales  DAVAO CITY, Philippines, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A government investigator into a blaze that led to the deaths of 37 staff at the southern Philippines offices of an American market research firm says there are indications of fire safety lapses that may have contributed to the tragedy.  The Dec. 23 blaze in Davao City broke out at a furniture and fabric store on the third level of a mall, the New City Commercial Center (NCCC), and then engulfed the offices of the U.S. firm, Research Now SSI, on the fourth floor of the same building in choking smoke.  The only person among the 38 killed in the fire who didn\u2019t work at the firm was a mall security officer. More than 100 SSI employees who were on duty that day managed to escape, of whom six were injured.  Initial evidence from an ongoing investigation by Philippine government agencies indicates sprinkler systems on the 3rd and 4th floors of the building weren\u2019t working as their valves were closed, said Senior Superintendent Jerry Candido, who is director of logistics at the Philippines\u2019 Bureau of Fire Protection and one of the lead investigators into the fire.  Candido said that Research Now SSI employees may have been unaware of the fire beneath them for some time because their office had its own alarm that was not connected to the system used by the mall. \u201cThat explains why people inside the SSI were not aware that fire is happening just below their floor,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  His comments are the most extensive yet made publicly on the progress of the investigation.  In a statement issued in the United States on Friday, Research Now SSI said it is working with the authorities involved in the probe into the fire and is \u201cconfident that an impartial investigation will reveal that it has complied with all the security and safety requirements required by law\u201d.  \u201cWe are focused on helping our employees and the victims\u2019 families, and cooperating with the government agencies, over the coming weeks and months,\u201d said the firm\u2019s CEO Gary Laben.  Privately-held Research Now SSI is the result of a merger between Plano, Texas-based Research Now and Shelton, Connecticut-headquartered Survey Sampling International, which had operated the Davao call centre, only three days before the fire. The merged company\u2019s major shareholders are the private equity firms Court Square Capital Partners and HGGC.  Darry Gallego, assistant vice president of corporate services at NCCC, said the mall could not comment on an ongoing investigation, but stressed that safety requirements had been met, including having a sprinkler system.  \u201cThe mall had passed through all the needed safety examinations and was certified by the authorities as being safe to operate and serve the public,\u201d Gallego said in an email.  Candido cautioned that the investigation is still some way from being completed and it has yet to reach firm conclusions, particularly on the issue of liability.  SSI, which rented the offices from NCCC, needed to have its own operating sprinkler system to get its annual fire safety inspection certificate, which was in turn required for its yearly business permit renewal, Candido said.  Investigators will look into whether there were any questions that came up when NCCC and SSI were granted these certificates this year and in previous years, he said.  NCCC last got the certificate in April 2017 and SSI in September 2017, according to Honee Fritz Alagano, Davao City fire marshall and spokeswoman for the Bureau of Fire Protection in the city. That was after passing the Davao City Bureau of Fire Protection\u2019s annual inspections, she said.  Candido said it was the responsibility of both building owners and tenants to make sure that alarm and sprinkler systems were installed and operating. Under the nation\u2019s fire code, if there were two alarm systems they should be integrated so that the mall\u2019s would have triggered SSI\u2019s, and vice-versa.  Barbara Palmer, SSI\u2019s senior vice president for global marketing, said in an email response to a series of Reuters\u2019 questions about fire safety at its Davao offices that the firm could not address them specifically while the investigation is ongoing.  Gallego from NCCC also declined to comment on specific safety issues.  Candido said investigators are also looking at whether the ceiling material in the call centre was flammable but haven\u2019t drawn any conclusions yet.  He also said that the investigation was looking at some major structural questions concerning the SSI offices and how they related to the rest of the mall \u2013 issues that may not have put anyone in breach of regulations.  For example, while SSI\u2019s fire exits would have passed inspection, only one of them had stairs leading directly outside the building. The others, he said, headed back into the mall. These areas quickly filled up with smoke making them useless as a means to escape, he said.  Indeed, the position of the offices in the mall may have put them at high risk as the smoke from a fire elsewhere in the building would be funneled towards the offices, Candido said.  \u201cWhen fire occurred in any part of the mall, SSI will be fully engulfed. That explains why the exits were not used because they were cut off by the smoke,\u201d he said.  Candido separately told reporters that initial findings indicated the fire was caused by an electrical problem in the ceiling at the furniture and fabric store, exacerbated by the failure of the sprinkler system on that same floor.  He also said the Research Now SSI records showed that the firm\u2019s latest fire drill was poorly attended. He did not say when the exercise took place. \u201cOut of hundreds of personnel, less than 10 participated,\u201d he said, adding that three of those died in the blaze.  NCCC\u2019s Gallego and SSI\u2019s Palmer declined to comment on Candido\u2019s assertions.  Alagano, the fire marshall, said that soundproofing in SSI\u2019s offices meant that staff may not have heard the alarm go off in the mall. She also said it is clear that some employees went to their lockers to get their mobile phones before trying to evacuate, wasting precious time.  The probe will also be looking at how long it took the mall to call the fire brigade. Alagano said the fire likely started some time between 9.40 a.m. and 9.48 a.m., but the fire service database showed it didn\u2019t get the call until 10.05 a.m and firefighters arrived five minutes after that.  SSI says it has operations across the world and more than 3,500 market research, consulting, media, healthcare and corporate clients. It had about 500 employees at the Davao operation.  It is part of the Philippines\u2019 $23 billion business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. That is a vital source of jobs and foreign exchange, providing incomes key to driving what is one of Asia\u2019s fastest growing economies, though wages for call centre workers are low at around $3,000-$5,000 a year, depending on location and experience.  The sector employs about 1.15 million people providing services to mostly international firms, with the United States its biggest market. The industry expects that to grow to 1.8 million people by 2025 amid plans to expand beyond its mainstay call centre services.  Reuters reached out to numerous SSI employees in Davao in person and via their social media accounts but none of them agreed to be interviewed.  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who was Davao\u2019s mayor for 22 years and was credited with boosting its economy by luring BPO firms, has promised relatives of victims that the truth will come out.

          "title": "UK may use taxes to get tech giants to do more to fight extremism, minister says",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain may impose new taxes on tech giants like Google and Facebook unless they do more to combat online extremism by taking down material aimed at radicalizing people or helping them to prepare attacks, the country\u2019s security minister said.  Ben Wallace accused tech firms of being happy to sell people\u2019s data but not to give it to the government which was being forced to spend vast sums on de-radicalization programs, surveillance and other counter-terrorism measures.  \u201cIf they continue to be less than co-operative, we should look at things like tax as a way of incentivizing them or compen\u00adsating for their inaction,\u201d Wallace told the Sunday Times newspaper in an interview.   His quotes did not give further details on tax plans. The newspaper said that any demand would take the form of a windfall tax similar to that imposed on privatized utilities by former Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s government in 1997.  Wallace accused the tech giants of putting private profit before public safety.  \u201cWe should stop pretending that because they sit on beanbags in T-shirts they are not ruthless profiteers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will ruthlessly sell our details to loans and soft-porn companies but not give it to our democratically elected government.\u201d  Facebook executive Simon Milner rejected the criticisms.  \u201cMr Wallace is wrong to say that we put profit before safety, especially in the fight against terrorism,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested millions of pounds in people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content.\u201d  YouTube, which is owned by Google, said it was doing more every day to tackle violent extremism.  \u201cOver the course of 2017 we have made significant progress through investing in machine learning technology, recruiting more reviewers, building partnerships with experts and collaboration with other companies,\u201d a YouTube spokeswoman said.  Britain suffered a series of attacks by Islamic extremists between March and June this year that killed a total of 36 people, excluding the attackers.   Two involved vehicles ramming people on bridges in London, followed by attackers stabbing people. The deadliest, a bombing at a concert in the northern city of Manchester, killed 22 people.  Following the second bridge attack, Prime Minister Theresa May proposed beefing up regulations on cyberspace, and weeks later interior minister Amber Rudd traveled to California to ask Silicon Valley to step up efforts against extremism.  \u201cWe are more vulnerable than at any point in the last 100 years,\u201d said Wallace, citing extremist material on social media and encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp as tools that made life too easy for attackers.  \u201cBecause content is not being taken down as quickly as they could do, we\u2019re having to de-radicalize people who have been radicalised. That\u2019s costing millions. They can\u2019t get away with that and we should look at all the options, including tax.\u201d  Facebook said it removed 83 percent of uploaded copies of terrorist content within one hour of its being found on the social media network.  It also highlighted plans to double the number of people working in its safety and security teams to 20,000 by the end of 2018.  YouTube said that progress in machine learning meant that 83 percent of violent extremist content was removed without the need for users to flag it.

          "body": "* Geopolitics, slumping economic growth weighed on Gulf bourses  * Saudi index edged up just 0.2 pct in year, Dubai fell 4.6 pct  * Valuations, higher state spending should help markets in 2018  * Saudi\u2019s National Commercial Bank surges on bonus share issue  * Dar Al Arkan pulls back after news of unit\u2019s IPO plan  By Andrew Torchia  DUBAI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Middle Eastern stock markets far underperformed the rest of the world in 2017 but as the year ended, beaten-down valuations for shares and plans for higher government spending gave investors reason to expect a better 2018.  Egypt\u2019s stock index surged 21.7 percent in 2017 as economic reforms bore fruit, but the picture in the Gulf was little short of disastrous because of geopolitical tensions, sluggish economic growth and sagging real estate prices.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s index edged up just 0.2 percent during the year compared to a 34 percent leap for MSCI\u2019s emerging markets index. Among other major Gulf markets, Dubai fell 4.6 percent and Qatar, hit by a boycott imposed by other Arab states, lost 18.3 percent.  The new year looks unlikely to be as poor in the Gulf, however, partly because many share valuations have been beaten down to stand in line with, or even below, other emerging markets.  Also, a rise of oil prices in the last few months has let Gulf Cooperation Council governments slow austerity drives that have slashed economic growth and damaged corporate earnings. Growth is widely projected to pick up moderately in 2018.  \u201cWith this backdrop and underpinned by undemanding valuations, we are generally optimistic on the GCC for the year 2018, with the outlook ranging from slightly negative to moderately bullish across the board,\u201d said Bader al-Ghanim, head of GCC asset management at Kuwait\u2019s Global Investment House.  A Reuters poll of 13 leading Middle Eastern asset managers, released on Sunday, found 54 percent expect to raise allocations to regional equities over the next three months and none to cut them, the most positive balance since August.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s index edged down 0.1 percent on Sunday as real estate developer Dar Al Arkan, the most heavily traded stock, sank 5.0 percent despite saying it would offer 30 percent of Dar Al Arkan Properties, a property management firm with assets of 2.68 billion riyals ($715 million), to the public. It did not specify a date.  The stock had more than doubled in the past three months, partly in anticipation of the IPO.  National Commercial Bank, the biggest bank, climbed 2.7 percent in active trade. Its board proposed increasing the bank\u2019s capital by 10 billion riyals to 30 billion riyals by issuing bonus shares funded from retained earnings.  Qatar\u2019s index edged down 0.03 percent on Sunday as the biggest lender, Qatar National Bank, slipped 0.8 per cent.  The year\u2019s final day of trade for markets in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait was Thursday.  * The index edged down 0.1 percent to 7,226 points.  * The index edged down 0.03 percent to 8,523 points.  * The index edged up 0.01 percent to 15,019 points.  * The index surged 2.0 percent to 1,332 points.  * The index added 1.0 percent to 5,099 points.

          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An oil pipeline company established decades ago by Israel and Iran, and a new Israeli company that is meant to replace it, can continue to operate secretly, an Israeli parliamentary committee ruled on Sunday.  The Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC) was a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil via Israel to the Mediterranean. Ties were cut after Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic revolution, and the enemies are now locked in arbitration that could be worth billions of dollars.  Although Iranian oil no longer flows through the pipeline, EAPC has become a major distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a leading trade hub.  It also added a reverse-flow system so oil from the Black or Caspian Seas can be shipped from Eilat, Israel\u2019s southernmost city and port, to southern Asia and the Far East, and increased its storage capacity for traders in the region.  Israel, worried about national security, maintains tight control over EAPC, to the extent that articles about its business dealings must pass through the military censor.   Instead of renewing EAPC\u2019s concession, which came up this year, Israel formed a new company with the same initials, the Europe Asia Pipeline Co, owned by the government. It will take over the original EAPC\u2019s responsibilities by September, with an option to extend the handover period an additional six months.  Parliament\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee said in a statement on Sunday that it had extended the gag order on EAPC for five more years and broadened it to include the new company, known as EAPC-B, as well.  Calls to end the secrecy surrounding EAPC emerged after its pipe burst in 2014, spilling millions of liters of oil into a desert nature reserve in Israel\u2019s worst spill.  After an Israeli environmental group petitioned the Supreme Court, the gag order was narrowed slightly to exclude issues like environmental impact and safety measures. The company\u2019s primary dealings, including the sources of oil and how it is used, are still under censorship.  Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch, editing by Larry King"

          "body": "(Refiles to make clear 3.2 million Iranians are jobless)  By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin  LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Protesters in Iran who have staged three days of demonstrations over economic hardship and alleged corruption should pay a high price if they break the law, the government said on Sunday.  The wave of anti-government demonstrations in several cities are the biggest challenge to Iran\u2019s leaders since unrest in 2009 that followed the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went on for months.  Protesters have attacked banks and government buildings and burned a police motorcycle. Two protesters were shot dead in the western town of Dorud on Saturday night. The deputy governor of Lorestan province blamed foreign agents for the deaths.  \u201cNo shots were fired by the police and security forces. We have found evidence of enemies of the revolution, Takfiri groups and foreign agents in this clash,\u201d Habibollah Khojastehpour said in an interview on state television on Sunday. Takfiri is a term for Sunni militants especially the Islamic State.  State media also quoted Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli as saying: \u201cThose who damage public property, violate law and order and create unrest are responsible for their actions and should pay the price.\u201d  Ahmad Khatami, a hardline cleric who leads Friday prayers in the capital Tehran, said the protests were similar to those in 2009 over alleged electoral fraud.  He called for capital punishment for those chanting slogans against the values of the Islamic Republic.  The protests have included chants and slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the clerical leadership in power since 1979 revolution.  Videos posted on social media showed people chanting: \u201cMullahs, have some shame, let go of the country.\u201d  Protests defied the police and  Revolutionary Guards who have used violence to crush previous unrest because they are motivated by economic grievances and have no clear leader.  They are also difficult for the government of President Hassan Rouhani because he was elected on a promise to guarantee rights to freedom of expression and assembly.  Rouhani\u2019s main achievement, a 2015 deal with world powers that curbed Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for a lifting of most international sanctions, is yet to bring the economic benefits the government promised.  Unemployment rose to 12.4 percent this fiscal year up 1.4 percentage points, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran. 3.2 million Iranians are jobless. (Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)"

          "body": "KHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian police on Saturday freed the remaining hostages being held in a post office by an man believed to be strapped with explosives, and arrested the hostage taker after an hours-long standoff in the city of Kharkiv.   \u201cAll hostages freed in Kharkiv. The assailant was arrested,\u201d President Petro Poroshenko wrote on Twitter, while Interior Minister Arsen Avakov published a picture of the man, with blood streaming down his face, being held by a policeman.  None of the hostages were harmed. A Reuters witness saw special force police in green camouflage rushing to the entrance of the post office, a yellow-and-white building at a road junction in the northeastern city near the Russian border.  In earlier statements, police said the man had entered the post office wearing a mask and taken 11 people hostage with the intention of robbing the place. Five of the hostages \u2014 three women and two children \u2014 were released early.   Regional police chief Oleg Bekh told reporters the man had a history of antisocial behavior and drug-related offences.   \u201cHe probably needs the help of a psychiatrist,\u201d Bekh said. \u201cDuring the detention, he received minor injuries. He was not in a normal state ... the hostages said he was drinking alcohol.\u201d  Police were able to enter the building after one of the hostages opened the door for them, Kharkiv regional prosecutor Yuriy Danylchenko told reporters.   Police earlier said they had been in contact with the man via the telephones of the hostages, describing his manner as calm and not making any demands.  Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Avakov, said employees at the post office and customers had been among the hostages. One of them had managed to call the police from inside the building.  \u201cThe patrolmen came to the place of the robbery in a few minutes,\u201d Gerashchenko wrote on Facebook. \u201cThe robber realized that he could not now safely leave the crime scene with the loot and he decided to declare that he was taking everyone hostage.\u201d   One of the children released by the hostage taker told local media that the man had put explosives into two bottles and threatened to blow himself up if police did not listen to him. The man also said he had brain cancer, according to the child.   The man at one point voiced concern about the recent prisoner exchange between the Ukrainian authorities and pro-Russian separatists and thought more prisoners should have been released, police said.   Ukraine and the separatists swapped hundreds of prisoners on Wednesday in the biggest such exchange since the outbreak of a conflict in the eastern Donbass region that has killed more than 10,000 people.

Singapore\u2019s trade-reliant economy has enjoyed a boost this year from an improvement in global demand, particularly for electronics products and components such as semiconductors.  \u201cOur economy grew by 3.5 percent, more than double our initial forecast,\u201d Lee said in his New Year message to the nation, adding that incomes have risen across the board.  \u201cWe have benefited from the global economic upswing.

The government is due to release its advance estimates for GDP in the fourth quarter and the whole of 2017 on Jan. 2.  The GDP data is expected to show that the economy lost some steam in the October-December quarter after recording its fastest year-on-year growth in nearly four years in the third quarter.

          "body": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece dismissed Turkish anger on Sunday over its decision to grant asylum to a soldier who Ankara accuses of involvement in the abortive coup against President Tayyip Erdogan in July 2016.  Turkey said on Saturday the decision by a Greek asylum board undermined relations between the two countries. The soldier was one of eight who fled after the July 15 coup attempt.  It also accused Athens of harboring \u201ccoup plotters\u201d, a charge Greece denies. The countries are at odds over a host of issues from ethnically split Cyprus to sovereignty over airspace, but their relations had improved in recent years.  The asylum board rejected the applications by the other seven soldiers, and the Greek government has appealed the decision to grant the soldier asylum and sought its annulment. But it says the country\u2019s judiciary is independent.  \u201cOur faith in democratic principles and practices is not a weakness, but a source of strength,\u201d the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday.  \u201cDemocracies do not threaten, or can be threatened,\u201d the foreign ministry said.   \u201cOn the contrary, they work responsibly and methodically to promote understanding and entrench stability and good neighborly relations. Greece will continue this path ...and hopes its neighbors will do the same.\u201d  The eight soldiers had flown by helicopter to Greece in the early hours of July 16, 2016, as the attempted coup against Erdogan crumbled. They had denied involvement in the attempt.  Reporting By Michele Kambas, editing by Larry King"

          "body": "The Kansas City Chiefs won\u2019t be at full strength for their regular-season finale Sunday against the host Denver Broncos in hopes of ensuring they are as healthy as possible for the playoffs. The Chiefs, who are locked into the AFC\u2019s No. 4 seed, will rest quarterback Alex Smith and potentially several other key players.  Patrick Mahomes II will start in place of Smith, making him the first rookie quarterback to start for Kansas City in a non-strike game since Steve Fuller did it in 1979. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position where we can do that,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid told reporters. \u201cIt gives the kid some experience. That\u2019s the reason. Listen, the Broncos are a good football team, real good defense. It\u2019ll be a great experience for him to go against that crew.\u201d The Broncos will take a look at a young quarterback of their own, giving Paxton Lynch his fourth career start and second of the season. The Chiefs have won four straight meetings, including a 29-19 home win in Week 8 in which the Broncos committed five turnovers.  TV: 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS. LINE: Broncos -3.5. O/U: 38.5  ABOUT THE CHIEFS (9-6): Kansas City has won three straight and appears to be back on track following a stretch of six losses in seven games. The offense is clicking again, but it will be interesting to see how effective it is with Mahomes under center and other key players likely playing limited roles. The defense has seen a dramatic turnaround, holding three straight opponents under 350 total yards and forcing nine turnovers after ranking near the bottom of the league in total defense for most of the season.  ABOUT THE BRONCOS (5-10): Denver ranks second in total defense but 22nd in scoring defense, due in large part to the offense\u2019s 31 turnovers setting up opponents with favorable field position. The Broncos hope Lynch can do a better job of taking care of the ball than Trevor Siemian and Brock Osweiler did. Unfortunately for Lynch, he is likely to be without No. 2 receiver Emmanuel Sanders, who has torched the Chiefs for 188 receiving yards in his last two games against them.  1. Kansas City TE Travis Kelce has averaged 131.3 receiving yards in his last three games against Denver.  2. Denver RB C.J. Anderson needs 54 yards to become the team\u2019s first 1,000-yard rusher since Knowshon Moreno in 2013.  3. Broncos WR Demaryius Thomas needs 108 receiving yards for his six consecutive 1,000-yard season.  PREDICTION: Chiefs 23, Broncos 20 "

          "body": "While neither team has anything for which to play, there is one notable storyline when the New York Giants host the Washington Redskins in Sunday\u2019s regular-season finale between the bitter NFC East rivals. There\u2019s a chance that both quarterbacks \u2014 Washington\u2019s Kirk Cousins and New York\u2019s Eli Manning \u2014 could be with different teams next season.  The Redskins have used the franchise tag on Cousins in each of the past two seasons, so speculation already has begun on whether he will end up on the free-agent market. \u201cI\u2019m looking at the future as Sunday against the New York Giants,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cThat\u2019s really where my future is right now.\u201d Among the many lowlights for New York was the controversial one-game benching of Manning, who, like Cousins, prefers to focus on the immediate task at hand \u2014 avenging a 20-10 loss in Washington on Thanksgiving Day. \u201cI think in football you never know when your last game is going to be,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt\u2019s a physical game, so you always treat it like it\u2019s your last. So, I\u2019m just going about it, try to play well and move the offense.\u201d  TV: 1 p.m. ET, NBC. LINE: Redskins -3. O/U: 37.5  ABOUT THE REDSKINS (7-8): Cousins, who needs 65 passing yards to reach 4,000 for the third straight season, rallied Washington past New York with a pair of second-half touchdown passes in the previous meeting. After a pair of rocky performances in back-to-back drubbings at Dallas and the Los Angeles Chargers, he has five touchdowns against one interception in home wins over Arizona and Denver the past two weeks. Wideout Jamison Crowder was a bright spot on Thanksgiving with seven catches for 141 yards and a touchdown while rookie Samaje Perine ran for 100 yards. Washington notched four of its 40 sacks on Thanksgiving.  ABOUT THE GIANTS (2-13): Losers of five in a row, New York had the look of a team playing out the string in a meek 23-0 setback in Arizona last week that dropped the team to 0-3 under interim coach Steve Spagnuolo. Manning was benched following an ugly performance in the first matchup against Washington, when he was limited to a season-low 113 yards passing. Manning could be without his leading receiver in tight end Evan Engram (bruised ribs) and can\u2019t rely on a running game that is ranked 29th with an average of 85.9 yards. New York also will be without safety Landon Collins and cornerback Janoris Jenkins.  1. Manning has thrown for 879 yards and six TDs in his last three at home versus the Redskins.  2. A win will give Washington three consecutive years without a losing season for the first time since 1999-2001.  3. New York benched CB Eli Apple on Wednesday due to conduct detrimental to the team.

          "body": "With a playoff berth already secured, the New Orleans Saints aim for the NFC South title when they visit the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. The Saints need just a victory to claim the crown but also would finish atop the division with either a loss by Carolina or a tie by both clubs.  New Orleans put itself in position to win the division by bouncing back from a loss at Atlanta in Week 14 with victories over the New York Jets and Falcons. The title would be the first since 2011 for the Saints, who went 7-9 in four of their last five seasons - including each of the last three. Tampa Bay hopes to avoid ending the campaign with a six-game losing streak, as it has not been victorious since recording a 30-20 win at Miami on Nov. 19. Each of the Buccaneers\u2019 last four setbacks has been by fewer than seven points, including last week\u2019s 22-19 defeat at Carolina.  TV: 4:25 p.m. ET, FOX. LINE: Saints -6.5. O/U: 50.5  ABOUT THE SAINTS (11-4): Drew Brees eclipsed 70,000 career passing yards last week, joining Peyton Manning and Brett Favre as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to accomplish the feat. With his 239 yards against Atlanta, he raised his season total to 4,089 - extending his league record to 12 consecutive campaigns of 4,000 or more. Michael Thomas (98) is one of two players to have at least 90 receptions in each of his first two seasons in the NFL and needs five catches to surpass Jarvis Landry (194 from 2014-15) for most in his first two campaigns.  ABOUT THE BUCCANEERS (4-11): Mike Evans leads the team with 946 receiving yards and can join Randy Moss and A.J. Green as the only players in NFL history with at least 1,000 in each of their first four seasons. Jameis Winston lost three fumbles in last week\u2019s setback and has gone eight consecutive starts without a victory. Rookie Chris Godwin suffered an ankle injury against Carolina and has not practiced this week while fellow wide receiver DeSean Jackson hopes to return from a similar ailment that kept him out of action versus the Panthers.  1. Brees leads the NFL with a 71.9 completion percentage and can eclipse Sam Bradford\u2019s 71.6 mark last season for the best in league history.  2. Tampa Bay\u2019s Gerald McCoy leads all NFL defensive tackles with 39.5 sacks since 2013.  3. New Orleans RB Alvin Kamara is tied for first among NFL rookies with 75 receptions.

The 23rd-ranked Bluejays attempt to improve to 9-0 in Omaha in 2017-18 on Sunday when they host Providence in an early Big East tilt.  Creighton has held a halftime lead in 12 of its 14 games - including at least a seven-point advantage in each of its last three contests against Top 25 foes - only to watch its first-half superiority go for naught in those critical matchups. \u201cWe always talk about wanting to be a great team. In order to be a great team, we are going to have to get over these little humps. We are going to have to figure out how to beat these teams,\u201d Bluejays guard Marcus Foster told reporters after Thursday\u2019s 90-84 loss at No. 24 Seton Hall. The Friars endured a bit of a rocky road during non-conference action, but they enjoyed arguably one of their finest all-around efforts of the season while dismantling St. John\u2019s 94-72 in Thursday\u2019s conference opener. Providence outscored the Red Storm 53-32 in the second half and caught fire from the perimeter over those final 20 minutes, connecting on 11-of-16 of its 3-point attempts.  TV: 2:30 p.m. ET, Fox Sports 1  ABOUT PROVIDENCE (10-4, 1-0 Big East): Kyron Cartwright (9.5 points, 6.4 assists) returned from a one-game absence due to an ankle injury Thursday and was masterful in leading the offense, finishing with a season-high 21 points as well as 15 assists - tied for the fifth highest single-game total ever by a Friar. Sophomore guard Alpha Diallo (10.8 points, 5.5 rebounds), who had been rendered ineffective for most of the previous four games with his own ankle injury, tallied 16 points and a career-high 12 boards in his return for his second career double-double. Rodney Bullock (team-leading marks of 17.0 points, 6.5 rebounds) has scored at least 20 points in three straight outings, shooting 51.7 percent from the field over that span.  ABOUT CREIGHTON (10-3, 0-1): Foster (team-high 19.1 points) injured his right knee early in the first half and scored only two of his 14 points Thursday after halftime, going 1-for-6 from the floor over the final 20 minutes and partially explaining the Bluejays\u2019 most recent second-half collapse against a ranked foe. Martin Krampelj (12.6 points, team-leading 7.8 rebounds) picked up the offensive slack for the Big East\u2019s fifth-leading scorer, posting his third double-double of the season after scoring a career-high 23 points and collecting 10 boards. Reigning co-Big East Defensive Player of the Year Khyri Thomas (15.1 points) has reached double figures in all but one contest this season and drained at least one 3-pointer in 26 of Creighton\u2019s last 27 games.  TIP-INS  1. Creighton has owned a lead of 25 points or more at some point in the first half in each of its last three home games.  2. The Friars rank second in the Big East and 20th in Division I in 3-point accuracy (41.1).  3. The Bluejays, who rank fifth nationally in scoring offense (91.7 points), are outscoring opponents by over 32 points per game at home this season.  PREDICTION: Creighton 93, Providence 87 "

Tampa Bay dropped a 5-3 decision to Philadelphia on Friday for its second loss in 12 games while the Blue Jackets coughed up a lead in the 5-4 setback at Ottawa the same night.  The Lightning, who boast a league-best 56 points, had won eight straight games at home before allowing two power-play goals and 29 shots on net in the final two periods against the Flyers. \u201cWhen you win games a lot of things get swept under the rug, by you and the video as a team, by the media.

Tyler Johnson takes an 11-game point streak into Columbus after his 99th career goal Friday gave him six tallies and 10 assists during his run. Goalie Peter Budaj (left leg) was placed on injured reserve Saturday and Tampa Bay recalled Louis Domingue from Syracuse of the American Hockey League to back up No. 1 Andrei Vasilevskiy (league-best 24 wins, 2.08 goals-against average, .934 save percentage).  ABOUT THE BLUE JACKETS (22-14-3): Sergei Bobrovsky, who boasts 199 career victories, has struggled to an .896 save percentage over the last five games after giving up five goals on 28 shots Friday. Left wing Artemi Panarin owns three goals and three assists over the last four games to push his team-leading total to 34 points - 10 more than anyone else on the roster - while Sonny Milano has three goals in the past two contests.

Edmonton fell 4-3 in overtime to Chicago at home Friday after a 4-3 loss at Winnipeg on Wednesday, which followed a four-game winning streak. \u201cWe were able to come back and earn the point, but it was a frustrating night for our team and for some individuals,\u201d Edmonton coach Todd McLellan told the media afterward.  TV: 7 p.m. ET, Sportsnet  ABOUT THE JETS (22-11-6): Connor and forward Blake Wheeler each finished with two points Friday, in the first game since linemate and center Mark Scheifele was lost for six-to-eight weeks with an upper-body injury. Goaltender Connor Hellebuyck was solid in making 42 saves Friday and is tied for third in the NHL in wins with 20. One area of concern is away from home, as Winnipeg has won just once in its past nine road contests.

Goaltender Cam Talbot allowed four goals for the second consecutive game, dropping his record to 14-11-2 one season after he shared the NHL lead with 42 wins.

          "body": "The Pittsburgh Steelers have secured a first-round bye and still have an outside shot at the No. 1 seed when they host the winless Cleveland Browns in Sunday\u2019s regular-season finale. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin is unsure how much he will play his starters versus Cleveland, which is trying to avoid becoming the second NFL team to finish 0-16.  Pittsburgh\u2019s only chance at wresting the top overall seed from New England is to have the Patriots lose at home to the New York Jets. Tomlin said it will likely be an \u201c11th-hour decision\u201d as to how much playing time to give his starters but insisted there will be no \u201cempathy\u201d toward the plight of the Browns factoring into his thoughts. \u201cMore important than anything is we lay a foundation of our plan and get going in terms of things we need to do to play well. That\u2019s always been our mentality,\u201d Tomlin insisted. \u201cThose are things (playing) we\u2019ll decide later in the week.\u201d Cleveland is 1-30 under coach Hue Jackson, who said he expects to be back next season regardless of whether the Browns join the 2008 Detroit Lions as the only teams in history to go winless in a 16-game season.  TV: 1 p.m. ET, CBS. LINE: Steelers -11. O/U: 38  ABOUT THE BROWNS (0-15): Cleveland has lost five in a row to Pittsburgh, including a 21-18 setback at home in the season opener, and it\u2019s hard to envision that streak ending after the team has been limited to 10 points or fewer in four of the past six games. Quarterback DeShone Kizer has had a rocky rookie season with nine touchdowns versus a league-worst 21 interceptions, including two picks in each of the last three games. Running back Isaiah Crowell rushed for a career-best 152 yards in the 2016 regular-season finale against Pittsburgh, but he was held to 33 yards on 17 carries in the Week 1 loss. The defense has been stout against the run, yielding 97.1 yards per game.  ABOUT THE STEELERS (12-3): Star wide receiver Antonio Brown, who has 101 receptions and NFL-best 1,533 yards, already has been ruled out for the second straight game with a calf injury. Despite his absence, Pittsburgh rolled over Houston 34-6 last week as Ben Roethlisberger threw for 226 yards and two scores, including one to promising rookie JuJu Smith-Schuster, who has 32 of his 49 receptions over his past six games. Running back Le\u2019Veon Bell, the NFL\u2019s third-leading rusher with 1,291 yards, managed only 32 in the season opener and could be a candidate to sit out or see limited time. Pittsburgh\u2019s defense ranks second in the league with 50 sacks.  1. Roethlisberger has thrown as least two TD passes in seven straight games versus Cleveland.  2. Browns WR Josh Gordon has been quiet since returning from his suspension, but he has 21 catches in his last two versus the Steelers.  3. Pittsburgh went to the Super Bowl (2008, 2010) the last two times it earned a first-round bye.  PREDICTION: Steelers 23, Browns 16 "

          "body": "The Indiana Pacers are struggling to find a spark with top player Victor Oladipo sidelined with a knee injury and he is doubtful to return when they attempt to snap a three-game losing streak Sunday against the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves. Indiana missed Oladipo\u2019s scoring punch in a 98-94 loss at home against Dallas on Wednesday and then struggled to make stops in a 119-107 setback at Chicago on Friday.  \u201cThe effort was there sometimes, it just wasn\u2019t there for a whole 48 minutes,\u201d point guard Darren Collison told reporters Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do better, but we can\u2019t keep saying that. At some point we\u2019ve got to just go out there and do it.\u201d The Timberwolves had won five in a row before they opened a two-game road trip with a 102-96 loss at Milwaukee last time out. Three players scored at least 20 points for Minnesota, which blew a 20-point lead while scoring a season-low 12 in the fourth quarter one night after going to overtime to defeat Denver. \u201cI won\u2019t make excuses to be honest with you,\u201d guard Jamal Crawford told reporters when asked if fatigue was an issue. \u201cYou can say that, but we still built a big enough lead where we should have finished that game.\u201d  TV: 5 p.m. ET, FSN North (Minnesota), FSN Indiana  ABOUT THE TIMBERWOLVES (22-14): Point guard Jeff Teague was out against Milwaukee with a knee injury and Andrew Wiggins - who finished with 21 points - was forced to play through an ankle injury. Tyus Jones made his fourth start of the season in place of Teague and had six points, five assists and five steals, but he also had to power through the contest with a dislocated finger, according to coach Tom Thibodeau. Jimmy Butler scored 20 points in 43 minutes one night after playing 42 in the OT victory, and he entered Saturday ranked second in the NBA at 37.6 minutes per game.  ABOUT THE PACERS (19-17): Head coach Nate McMillan told reporters Friday that \u201cthere\u2019s some swelling\u201d in Oladipo\u2019s knee and the star guard will likely be reevaluated next week. Lance Stephenson has been starting in Oladipo\u2019s place and is averaging 17 points, 12 rebounds and four assists in the two games. Reserve guard Cory Joseph, who is averaging 9.3 points on 53.8 percent shooting over his last seven games, had a season-high 21 to help Indiana rout Minnesota 130-107 earlier this season in Minneapolis.  1. Timberwolves C Karl-Anthony Towns had a streak of four straight double-doubles snapped in the loss to Milwaukee but also matched a season high with four 3-pointers.  2. Collison is shooting 51.2 percent from 3-point range in December after posting 40.9 percent in November and 30.4 percent in October.  3. Butler, who missed the previous matchup against the Pacers, is averaging 29.3 points over a six-game span.  PREDICTION: Timberwolves 111, Pacers 109 "

          "body": "The Boston Celtics will try to avoid a letdown from a phenomenal comeback win when they host the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. After falling behind by 26 points to Houston on Thursday, the Celtics staged a memorable rally that was capped by Al Horford\u2019s go-ahead basket with 3.7 seconds left, lifting Boston in the opener of a four-game homestand.  \u201cI\u2019ve had a few comebacks, but this is a special one. From just how we started, it was just so ugly,\u201d guard Kyrie Irving told reporters after a 26-point effort. \u201cThey came out firing. We just had to battle back. It took a lot. It took everybody.\u201d It was just the second win in the last five home games for the Celtics, who entered Saturday having played two more games than any other team in the league. The Nets have had a busy pace as well with five games in an eight-day stretch - including four straight on the road capped by Friday\u2019s 111-87 victory in Miami, which represents Brooklyn\u2019s second-largest margin of victory this season. \u201cWe weren\u2019t perfect but we were more perfect than the other night,\u201d coach Kenny Atkinson told reporters, referring to a 15-point loss at New Orleans two nights earlier. \u201cThe challenge for us is to do it more consistently. That\u2019s what we\u2019re searching for.\u201d  TV: 5:30 p.m. ET, YES (Brooklyn), NBCSN Boston  ABOUT THE NETS (13-22): The most consistent performer of late has been forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, who made 8-of-9 shots and had 18 points and eight rebounds at Miami. The third-year pro is averaging 16.5 points and 8.3 boards over the last six games and recorded multiple steals in his last two contests. Joe Harris made all four of his 3-point attempts en route to a season-high 21 points versus the Heat, eclipsing the 19 points he scored in 20 minutes in a 109-102 loss to Boston on Nov. 14.  ABOUT THE CELTICS (29-10): Marcus Smart chipped in 13 points, six rebounds, five assists, three blocks and two steals against Houston, but it was his ability to draw two offensive fouls against Rockets superstar James Harden in the closing seconds that made headlines. \u201cIt just shows the value of Marcus Smart to our group and what he does for our team. It all started with him in the second half,\u201d Horford told the media. \u201cIt was just a domino effect. That\u2019s how special he is. And when he plays at that level we\u2019re just a different team.\u201d Rookie forward Jayson Tatum missed all six of his 3-point attempts over the last two games to fall into second place in the NBA at 47.5 percent from long range.  1. Nets G Caris LeVert had a career-high 11 assists Friday and scored at least 12 points - his average for the season - in seven consecutive games.  2. Celtics SG Jaylen Brown (knee) missed two straight games and is day-to-day.  3. Boston has won six straight meetings.  PREDICTION: Celtics 109, Nets 98 "

          "body": "The Oklahoma City Thunder had their six-game winning streak come to an end in controversial fashion, but they remain one of the hottest teams in the NBA. The Thunder will try to put the disappointing setback behind them and get back in the win column when they host the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday.  The NBA\u2019s last two minute report confirmed that Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo stepped out of bounds before his game-winning dunk in Oklahoma City\u2019s 97-95 setback on Friday. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see something on the ticker that says referees missed that one,\u201d Thunder forward Carmelo Anthony told reporters. \u201cWe can\u2019t do nothing about that at this point, so we might as well forget about it and move on and get ready for - who we play Sunday? Dallas? Get ready for Dallas.\u201d Oklahoma City will need to turn the page quickly to prepare for the Mavericks, who are riding a three-game winning streak and are coming off a 128-120 victory at New Orleans in which they buried a franchise-record 22 3-pointers. \u201cWe really moved the ball there, especially in the first half,\u201d Dallas forward Dirk Nowitzki told reporters. \u201cGuys just started to get hot. Devin (Harris) got hot, Wes (Matthews) hit like three or four in a row, and [Dennis Smith Jr.] was hot all night, stepping back behind a screen when they went under. That was beautiful to watch.\u201d  TV: 7 p.m. ET, FSN Southwest (Dallas), FSN Oklahoma  ABOUT THE MAVERICKS (12-25): Smith recorded his first career triple-double when he collected 21 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in Friday\u2019s win. \u201cThey were trying to press up at first, and I realized I could get to rack whenever I wanted,\u201d Smith told reporters. \u201cAfter I got the floater to go down, everybody started backing off and my jump shot was falling tonight. That really opened up the offense for everybody else.\u201d Smith was one of seven players to score at least 13 points as Dallas shot 55.4 percent from the floor and went 22-of-39 from beyond the arc on its record night, which lifted the team out of last place in the Western Conference.  ABOUT THE THUNDER (20-16): Oklahoma City\u2019s point guard knows all about triple-doubles, and Russell Westbrook\u2019s sensational play has been a key to the team\u2019s recent success. The reigning NBA MVP is averaging 31.4 points on 54.3 percent shooting, 10.1 assists and 9.1 rebounds over the last seven games, capped by 40 points, 14 boards and nine assists on Friday. The missing piece on Friday was forward Paul George, who sat out the contest with a knee injury and is not expected to be back on Sunday.  1. Thunder SG Andre Roberson (knee) is not expected to play Sunday.  2. Matthews went 4-of-7 from 3-point range on Friday after going 2-of-16 in the previous three games.  3. The home team took each of the first two meetings this season, with Oklahoma City earning a 112-99 win at home on Nov. 12.  PREDICTION: Thunder 106, Mavericks 102 "

          "body": "The Charlotte Hornets are coming off their best win of the season, just in time to face the suddenly-surging Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday. The Hornets knocked off the Golden State Warriors in the opener of their four-game California trip and are going up against a Clippers squad that won four of its last five contests.  Charlotte leaned on center Dwight Howard in its 111-100 win over the Warriors on Friday, which marked just their fifth win in the last 18 games. Howard scored a season-high 29 points to go with 13 rebounds and a season-high seven assists on Friday but is about to face a stiffer defensive challenge in Los Angeles center DeAndre Jordan. The Clippers\u2019 star center hauled in at least 14 rebounds in each of the last 12 games and got some support in the frontcourt on Friday with the return of power forward Blake Griffin (knee), who scored 24 points in 32 minutes in the 121-106 triumph over the Los Angeles Lakers after sitting out the previous 14 contests. \u201cOh, it was great,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers told reporters of Griffin\u2019s return. \u201cThe first eight minutes of the game, you couldn\u2019t ask for better basketball. They came out and attacked. What I liked most was Blake just kind of joined in.\u201d  TV: 7 p.m. ET, FSN Southeast (Charlotte), FSN Prime Ticket (Los Angeles)  ABOUT THE HORNETS (13-22): Charlotte will be trying to secure its first consecutive wins since a three-game streak from Nov. 18-22, and the team felt like it played its best on Friday. \u201cThere was a lot to like,\u201d associate head coach Stephen Silas told reporters. \u201cOur defense was really, really good. We got off to a slow start and the Warriors do what they do early in the game, but we just hung with it and stayed with our game plan. Got some big stops and that fueled our offense... Everybody played their part. It was a great, great win.\u201d The one point of concern is star guard Kemba Walker, who went 5-of-16 from the floor on Friday and is shooting 38.4 percent in December.  ABOUT THE CLIPPERS (15-19): Los Angeles went into a tailspin when Griffin first went down, dropping four straight and seven of 10, but began to play well two weeks ago with a stretch that includes a win over the Houston Rockets, and Griffin is just hoping to add to that success. \u201cIt felt good,\u201d Griffin told the Los Angeles Daily News. \u201cI didn\u2019t have second thoughts. I didn\u2019t have any moments where I didn\u2019t trust it, so that was important. Mostly it was important just mixing back in with the guys. I think we\u2019ve been playing really hard and playing the right way.\u201d The Clippers are averaging 118.2 points in the last five games after failing to score more than 91 in any of the previous three contests.  1. Clippers G Austin Rivers suffered a strained right Achilles on Friday and is day-to-day.  2. Howard is enjoying a string of three straight double-doubles.  3. Charlotte snapped a six-game losing streak in the series by easing past Los Angeles 102-87 at home on Nov. 18.  PREDICTION: Clippers 115, Hornets 108 "

          "body": "Already undermanned, St. John\u2019s could find itself without the services of its best player Sunday when it suits up against No. 24 Seton Hall in a Big East game. Shamorie Ponds injured his right knee in Thursday\u2019s loss to Providence and his status is uncertain for the game with the Pirates.  Ponds, a sophomore guard, does a little bit of everything for the Red Storm, including leading the team in points, assists and steals in addition to being second in rebounds. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s one of the best players on our team, one of the best players in our league,\u201d junior Marvin Clark II told the media of Ponds, who sat out the final nine minutes against Providence. \u201cBut everyone can bring something to the game.\u201d Chris Mullin\u2019s team was already without its second-leading scorer and one of its top defenders in sophomore Marcus LoVett, who missed his sixth straight game because of a strained left knee. The Pirates endured some defensive struggles by allowing 53 points in the first half to No. 23 Creighton, but righted the ship and overcame a 13-point deficit behind seniors Desi Rodriguez, Angel Delgado and Khadeen Carrington to prevail 90-83 on Thursday.  TV: 5 p.m. ET, Fox Sports 1  ABOUT ST. JOHN\u2019S (10-3, 0-1 Big East): The return of LoVett could offset the possible loss of Ponds, but if neither is available, it would put pressure on Clark, Justin Simon, Bashir Ahmed and others to carry the load. Clark had 20 points and eight rebounds against Providence and has shown he can score when given the green light to shoot, and Simon can stuff the stat sheet, but has not proven to be an explosive scorer like Ponds, who has seven games with 20 or more points this season. Ahmed is more of a complementary player given his inability to shoot for a high percentage and junior forward Tariq Owens, who has had at least four rebounds and two blocked shots in every game this season, is on the court more for defense than for offense.  ABOUT SETON HALL (12-2, 1-0): Michael Nzei may have earned himself a few more games in the starting lineup after his performance against Creighton. The junior forward from Nigeria, starting in place of Ismael Sanogo who returned from a one-game suspension but did not start, had seven points and 14 rebounds, the latter matching Delgado\u2019s total. \u201cWe\u2019re coming for everybody\u2019s head right now,\u201d Delgado, who had a team-high five assists in addition to 18 points and 14 rebounds, told the media after Pirates rallied against Creighton. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up. That\u2019s how it is in this league. If you sleep, they eat you.\u201d  TIP-INS  1. The Red Storm ranked sixth nationally in blocks per game (6.62), No. 19 in steals per game (8.85) and 27th in field goal defense (38.8 percent) entering Saturday.  2. The Pirates have won three straight games at home and four of six overall against the Red Storm, but still face a 59-38 deficit in the series.  3. Carrington produced his eighth straight game in double figures to become the 18th player in Seton Hall history with 1,500 career points while also surpassing 500 career field goals.

The Eagles aim to give the fickle faithful at Lincoln Financial Field reason for optimism heading into the playoffs in the regular-season finale against the rival Dallas Cowboys.  Philadelphia, which is the top scoring team in football, looked out of sorts by mustering just 13 points and 216 total yards on offense while going 1-for-14 on third-down conversions against what has been a forgiving defense in Oakland last week. \u201cI didn\u2019t play good enough,\u201d quarterback Nick Foles said on the heels of a 19-10 win over the Raiders. \u201cI have to play cleaner and, obviously, play better. Third down is a big thing with a quarterback: pinpoint accuracy, making good decisions. I\u2019ll look at the film. I\u2019ll improve.\u201d Dak Prescott sang a similar tune while placing the results of his sophomore campaign against those of last season, when he received NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. \u201cHaving a first year like I did, I think you almost want to take things for granted,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cAnd then you come in the second year and a lot of things just go against you and it\u2019s tough. On the field, off the field \u2014 you have to battle through it, and I feel like I\u2019ve done that. I\u2019ve given my all, I\u2019ll learn from it and get better.\u201d  TV: 1 p.m. ET, FOX. LINE: Cowboys -3. O/U: 39.5  ABOUT THE COWBOYS (8-7): Prescott\u2019s low point this season came in a disastrous outing against Philadelphia in a 37-9 rout on Nov. 19, in which he threw a career-high three interceptions and lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown on his way to a personal-worst 30.4 passer rating. Prescott saw his fifth multi-interception game come to fruition on Sunday, with Justin Coleman returning the ball 30 yards for a touchdown in Seattle\u2019s 21-12 win that ended both Dallas\u2019 three-game winning streak and any slim chance for the playoffs. Ezekiel Elliott returned from a six-game suspension with 97 yards on 24 carries on Sunday, moving him within 120 of joining Hall of Famer Tony Dorsett as the only running backs in franchise history to begin their careers with consecutive 1,000-yard seasons.  ABOUT THE EAGLES (13-2): Tight end Zach Ertz has recorded 27 receptions for 264 yards and two touchdowns in his last four games and figures to be busy for however long he plays on Sunday as Philadelphia attempts to re-establish its offensive rhythm. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re in panic mode by any means,\u201d the 27-year-old Ertz said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a lot of good players on the team and I think we have a lot of guys with a lot of pride that are going to figure this thing out.\u201d Ertz reeled in 13 catches for 139 yards and two scores in his last home game versus Dallas, although he had just two catches for eight yards in the first meeting this season. Alshon Jeffery had a touchdown reception in that encounter and found the end zone seven times in seven games before being held without a catch on two targets versus the Raiders last week.  1. Philadelphia QB Nate Sudfeld is expected to receive his first action of the season after Foles and the rest of the starters depart.  2. Dallas LB Sean Lee has 41 of his team-leading 93 tackles in the last three games.  3. Eagles rookie DE Derek Barnett had two sacks and a forced fumble in the first encounter versus the Cowboys.

The Seahawks also need Atlanta to lose to Carolina in order to grab the NFC\u2019s final wild-card berth.  Russell Wilson has passed for 3,762 yards and 32 touchdowns but has been shaky over the last two weeks with efforts of 142 and 93 yards. \u201cI think we can be a little bit better and I think I can be a little bit sharper,\u201d Wilson said at a press conference. \u201cOther than that, we\u2019ve been very successful throwing the ball all year. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that we\u2019re doing or anything like that, I think we just have to be a little bit sharper.\u201d Arizona will miss the playoffs for the second straight season, and coach Bruce Arians is shooting down rumors that Sunday will be his final game with the team. \u201cI\u2019m getting a little tired of it, yeah,\u201d Arians told reporters. \u201cThere will come a time and place when we decide what we are going to do.

O/U: 38.5  ABOUT THE CARDINALS (7-8): Fitzgerald signed a contract for next year but hasn\u2019t yet committed to playing despite another standout campaign that includes 101 receptions for 1,101 yards. The 34-year-old is the fifth player in NFL history to record five straight 100-catch seasons, and his first against the Seahawks - provided he doesn\u2019t get shut out - will stretch his streak to 211 games with a reception, which would tie Tony Gonzalez for the second-longest in league history. Pass rusher Chandler Jones, who has registered a league-leading 15 sacks, has recorded 5.5 and two forced fumbles in four career games against Seattle.  ABOUT THE SEAHAWKS (9-6): Wilson has been impressive in the fourth quarter with a league-best 18 touchdown passes, and he also has terrorized the Cardinals with nine TDs and zero interceptions over the last four meetings. The lack of a running game - Wilson\u2019s 550 yards are nearly three times as many as any running back on the active roster - has helped drag down the passing attack, and Seattle ranks 16th in total offense at 332.7 yards per game. Pass rushers Frank Clark (nine sacks) and Michael Bennett (8.5) are having big seasons for a defensive unit that hopes to have middle linebacker Bobby Wagner (team-best 130 tackles) closer to full strength from his hamstring injury.  1. The Cardinals are 3-1 in Seattle during Arians\u2019 tenure.  2. Seattle TE Jimmy Graham has recorded 10 touchdown receptions, including two in a 22-16 road win over the Cardinals on Nov. 9.  3. Arizona S Antoine Bethea (pectoral) was placed on injured reserve, ending a season in which he made a career-best five interceptions.  PREDICTION: Seahawks 19, Cardinals 13 "

Jacoby Brissett will make his 15th start of the season for the Colts, whose last win was a 20-14 decision at Houston. Brissett threw a pair of scoring passes in that game to T.Y. Hilton and surpassed 300 yards for the only time in his career. The Texans will turn to T.J. Yates under center after both Tom Savage and Taylor Heinicke were sidelined with concussions.

The Texans have surrendered 79 points in the past two outings while Yates has completed just 19 of 47 passes for 211 yards over that span.  AB0UT THE COLTS (3-12): Sunday could mark the end of the line for coach Chuck Pagano, who is on the hot seat as his team will miss the playoffs for the third straight year. Indianapolis has already locked up at least the third pick in the next NFL draft and could grab the second pick if it loses and Giants beat the Redskins on Sunday. The game could also be the finale in Indianapolis for running back Frank Gore, who said he wants to return for a 14th season but would like to play for a team with a stronger quarterback and offensive line.  1. Texans RB Alfred Blue rushed for a season-high 108 yards on 16 carries in last week\u2019s 34-6 loss against the Steelers.  2. The Colts\u2019 20-14 win earlier in the season snapped a three-game losing streak in the series.  3. Colts TE Jack Doyle had eight receptions for 63 yards in the team\u2019s first meeting.

          "body": "Rickard Rakell is heating up and so are the Anaheim Ducks as they look for a third victory in four games when they host the struggling Arizona Coyotes on Sunday. Rakell has scored in four straight games - the second time in his career he\u2019s done so - to increase his team-leading goal total to 12 as Anaheim continues its climb up the playoff position ladder in the Western Conference.  Some of Rakell\u2019s success can be traced to linemate and captain Ryan Getzlaf, who returned strong from missing 19 games with a facial injury and has 11 points in his past eight contests. Arizona had won two of its previous three games before Thursday\u2019s 7-4 loss to Toronto and has an NHL-worst 23 points while allowing a league-most 3.5 goals per game. \u201cI\u2019m running out of words to say what the problem is,\u201d the Coyotes\u2019 Jordan Martinook told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re such a fragile group when something bad happens to us.\u201d Anaheim claimed the first of four 2017-18 meetings by opening the season with a 5-4 victory Oct. 5 and has won six of the last seven encounters, including four straight at home.  TV: 4 p.m. ET, FSN Arizona, FSN West (Anaheim)  ABOUT THE COYOTES (9-26-5): Clayton Keller boasts team bests of 13 goals and 18 assists as his 31 points is third among NHL rookies, but his minus-18 rating is the worst of all Calder Trophy candidates. Rookie Christian Fischer is next with 10 goals, including three in his last five games, and his four power-play goals are tied for the team lead with Oliver Ekman-Larsson. Derek Stepan (eight goals, 23 points) has three goals and one assist in his last five games and owns an even rating during that span after he was a minus-16 in his first 35 contests this season.  ABOUT THE DUCKS (17-14-8): Ryan Kesler, who is set to play his 900th game Sunday, is a minus-3 in two games since making his season debut following offseason hip surgery, but showed why he is among the toughest two-way centers in the game when he fought Matthew Tkachuk on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s the type of player (he is),\u201d coach Randy Carlyle told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s an all-business type of player. He takes no prisoners and he plays the game that way. And that\u2019s why he\u2019s been a perennial Selke finalist. He\u2019s been a guy that\u2019s always on the other team\u2019s radar as far as a hard guy to play against.\u201d Cam Fowler has scored twice in the last three games, including his 50th career goal to join Francois Beauchemin (55) and Scott Niedermayer (60) as the only defenseman to reach that plateau with Anaheim.  1. Ducks RW Ondrej Kase (nine goals, 15 points in 26 contests) has matched his point total from his 53-game rookie season of 2016-17.  2. Ekman-Larsson is an NHL-worst minus-29 with teammates Keller, F Christian Dvorak (minus-18), F Brad Richardson (minus-17), D Alex Goligoski (minus-16) and Stepan also in the bottom 10 entering Saturday.  3. Anaheim RW Corey Perry (six goals, 22 points in 31 games) is expected to miss his ninth contest Sunday with a knee injury, but will accompany the team on its three-game trip through Western Canada that begins Tuesday in Vancouver.

          "body": "Kentucky comes into its SEC opener at home Sunday against Georgia following arguably its most impressive performance of the season, a 90-61 rout of in-state rival Louisville on Friday that drew praise from head coach John Calipari. The No. 15 Wildcats looked sluggish in their loss to UCLA last week, but Calipari lauded his team\u2019s effort from start to finish as freshman Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the way with a career-best 24 points.  \u201cWe just played about as well as we can play, and mainly because we finally competed and battled for an entire game,\u201d Calipari told reporters after the game. The Wildcats now begin pursuit of their fourth consecutive regular-season SEC title against a Georgia team that is off to its best start since 2010-11 and owns three victories against 2017 NCAA tournament qualifiers. The Bulldogs have won five of their past six and also played perhaps their best game of the season in their last outing, an 84-66 victory over Temple on Dec. 22. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned how to take care of the basketball and play with a little more discipline,\u201d Georgia coach Mark Fox told the media after the win.  TV: 6 p.m. ET, ESPN  ABOUT GEORGIA (9-2): Reigning SEC player of the week Yante Maten leads the Bulldogs in scoring (20.2 points, second in the league) and rebounds (9.3, tops in the conference), and the senior center is one of the top players in the SEC. Junior guard William Jackson has solidified the backcourt, scoring 12.1 points per game while reaching double figures nine times after scoring 10 points or more only twice in his first 66 career games. Georgia ranks 45th nationally in field-goal percentage defense (39.7 percent) and averages 40.5 rebounds per contest (28th in the country).  ABOUT KENTUCKY (10-2): Freshman Hamidou Diallo leads five Wildcats in scoring at 15.3 points per game, sparking an offense averaging 81.5 points per contest and shooting 49.4 percent from the field (29th nationally). Gilgeous-Alexander hit 9-of-16 shots from the field against Louisville and is shooting 51.6 percent for the season. Freshman PJ Washington scored 16 points with seven rebounds against the Cardinals and has reached double figures scoring in three of his past four games.  TIP-INS  1. After allowing UCLA to hit 12-of-30 3-point attempts, the Wildcats limited Louisville to 3-of-25 shooting from long range.  2. Georgia\u2019s bench has outscored its past two opponents (Georgia Tech and Temple) by a combined 33 points.  3. Kentucky has won nine of its past 10 meetings against Georgia and owns a 60-5 advantage at home.  PREDICTION: Kentucky 74, Georgia 70 "

          "body": "The Buffalo Bills find themselves in unfamiliar territory as they remain in contention for a playoff berth entering the final week of the regular season. The Bills will look to end a 17-year playoff drought on Sunday with a win over the Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium, but they\u2019ll need some help to boot.  In addition to completing a season sweep of Miami, Buffalo would require a Baltimore loss to Cincinnati or have Tennessee and the Los Angeles Chargers lose to Jacksonville and Oakland, respectively. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting, I\u2019ve got to believe, for this city,\u201d Bills coach Sean McDermott said. \u201c(This organization is) in a position that we haven\u2019t been in, this city hasn\u2019t been in, for a number of years.\u201d Unfortunately for the Dolphins, they are in a familiar position as losses in seven of nine games have the team set to miss the playoffs for the 14th time in the last 16 seasons. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve let a lot of things slip through our fingers and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve got to understand, when you\u2019re a young player, sometimes you forget how valuable every game is,\u201d Dolphins coach Adam Gase said.  TV: 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS. LINE: Bills -2.5. O/U: 42.5  ABOUT THE BILLS (8-7): LeSean McCoy resides fourth in the league in rushing with 1,128 yards, although the six-time Pro Bowl selection was limited to just 50 yards on 20 carries in Buffalo\u2019s 24-16 win over Miami on Dec. 17. McCoy was still productive with a rushing and receiving touchdown in that contest while also eclipsing 10,000 career yards, causing the 29-year-old to breathe a sigh of relief. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor tossed a touchdown pass and rushed for another against Miami, but was held out of the end zone the following week in a 37-16 rout by New England.  ABOUT THE DOLPHINS (6-9): Gase and Jarvis Landry each downplayed a deeper meaning to a sideline spat in last week\u2019s 29-13 loss at Kansas City, with the coach saying \u201cit\u2019s part of the game - it just happens\u201d while the wideout said he was merely having a conversation. Landry recorded 10 of his NFL-leading 103 catches in the last meeting with Buffalo while running back Kenyan Drake erupted for 113 scrimmage yards and a rushing score in that contest. Drake, who has found his stride since the in-season trade of Jay Ajayi to Philadelphia, got off to a fast start with runs of 31 and 19 yards in the first quarter.  1. Miami QB Jay Cutler benefited from plenty of short-yardage completions in the encounter versus Buffalo, but was done in by three interceptions.  2. Bills WR Deonte Thompson had four catches for 91 yards last week after mustering five receptions for 77 yards in his previous four games.  3. The Dolphins are minus-13 in turnover differential, while their 28 turnovers are tied for second most in the league.  PREDICTION: Dolphins 20, Bills 16 "

For the Titans, it means much, much more, as they can clinch a wild-card berth with a victory.  Tennessee, which has gone eight straight seasons without a playoff appearance, needs to break out of its funk in a hurry as it enters the matchup having lost three in a row - including last week\u2019s 27-23 home setback against the Los Angeles Rams. The Titans also would reach the postseason with losses by Buffalo and the Los Angeles Chargers, but they may have to play their season finale without DeMarco Murray after the running back suffered a torn MCL versus the Rams. Jacksonville, which is locked in as the third seed in the AFC, will be fielding its starters as it attempts to avenge a 37-16 home loss to Tennessee in Week 2. The Jaguars lead the NFL in sacks (52) and rank second in points allowed (253) despite last week\u2019s 44-33 defeat at San Francisco.  TV: 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS. LINE: Titans -3. O/U: 42  ABOUT THE JAGUARS (10-5): Leonard Fournette needs to gain 29 yards on the ground to join Fred Taylor (1,223) as the only rookies in franchise history to rush for 1,000. The 22-year-old from LSU also aims to record a rushing touchdown for the fourth consecutive game. Blake Bortles, who threw for a career-high 382 yards last week, has passed for 995 and nine touchdowns with only one interception in his last three visits to Tennessee.  ABOUT THE TITANS (8-7): With Murray\u2019s status in question, Derrick Henry is prepared to carry the load against the Jaguars. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many carries I\u2019m going to get,\u201d Henry, who leads the club with 693 rushing yards, told the team\u2019s website. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to make the most of my opportunities, and it\u2019s all about how we execute those.\u201d In addition to Murray, Tennessee also could be without cornerback Logan Ryan, who missed the loss to the Rams with an ankle injury and has not practiced this week.  1. Defense is not their only strong suit as the Jaguars top the league with an average of 145.3 rushing yards.  2. Tennessee S Kevin Byard is tied for second in the NFL with six interceptions.  3.

The high-scoring third-year guard attempts to guide his team to their first three-game winning streak of the season Sunday when they host the 76ers.  Phoenix is 5-2 over its last seven contests following Friday\u2019s 111-101 triumph at the Sacramento Kings and Booker is averaging 29 points in two games since he came back in a Dec. 26 victory against the Memphis Grizzlies. He erupted for a season-high 46 in the game before getting hurt in Philadelphia on Dec. 4, torching the 76ers for 32 points in the second half alone to lead the Suns to a 115-101 win - their largest margin of victory this season. Despite resting Joel Embiid in the first half of a back-to-back Saturday, Philadelphia put a halt to its struggles this month with a 107-102 road triumph against the Denver Nuggets - improving to 4-10 in December. Dario Saric led six 76ers in double figures with 20 points and added nine rebounds to go along with six assists.  TV: 8 p.m. ET, NBCSN Philadelphia, FSN Arizona (Phoenix)  ABOUT THE SIXERS (16-19): Embiid (back) flew directly from Portland to Phoenix and is expected to play his normal allotment of minutes Sunday after the former No. 3 overall pick buried a career-high six 3-pointers and tallied 29 points in Thursday\u2019s loss to the Trail Blazers. Despite being listed as doubtful for Saturday\u2019s contest with finger and knee injuries, Robert Covington posted his second double-double of the month and his third of the season with 15 points and 10 rebounds - recording three fewer points and two more boards than he did in the previous three games combined. Saric produced his 15th consecutive game with at least 10 points Saturday and is averaging 17.1 points, 8.3 boards and 3.9 assists over that span.  ABOUT THE SUNS (14-23): Phoenix improved to 8-0 this season when T.J.

Tyson Chandler (9.5) Alex Len (9.0) and Greg Monroe (8.3) are each averaging at least eight rebounds and only one other time in the last 40 years (2007-08) has Phoenix accomplished that feat over a full season.  1. During the Suns\u2019 5-2 stretch, their bench is averaging 45.7 points and 12 assists while shooting 91.9 percent from the foul line.  2.

Chicago began its trek with three consecutive losses over which it scored a total of three goals before edging Edmonton 4-3 in overtime on Friday.  The Blackhawks squandered a two-goal lead in the final 2:19 of the third period before Patrick Kane scored 50 seconds into the extra session, giving the team just its second victory in its last eight road games (2-5-1). Calgary is hoping to end its three-game slide (0-2-1) as it begins a string of three straight contests at Scotiabank Saddledome. Each of the Flames\u2019 setbacks during the skid were one-goal decisions, including Friday\u2019s 2-1 defeat at Anaheim.

I\u2019m sure if I didn\u2019t have any shots, I would have been sitting there wondering what\u2019s going on. It kind of felt routine after that.\u201d Fifteen of Chicago\u2019s 18 game-winning goals have been recorded by the trio of Artem Anisimov (six), Brandon Saad (six) and Kane.  ABOUT THE FLAMES (18-16-4): Calgary added depth on the blue line Saturday, acquiring Dalton Prout from New Jersey for goaltender Eddie Lack.

But the Huskies, who opened league play with an impressive 88-81 victory at USC, can match that total the first weekend of this season when they play at UCLA on Sunday night.  Washington, which finished 9-22 overall and 2-16 in the Pac-12 in Lorenzo Romar\u2019s final season, have turned things around quickly under first-year head coach Mike Hopkins, a longtime assistant to Jim Boeheim at Syracuse.

Thomas Welsh, a 7-foot senior center and one of the top mid-range shooters in college basketball, is second in scoring (13.1) and leads the team in rebounding (10.9) while freshman guards Jaylen Hands (12.8 points) and Kris Wilkes (12.5) are also averaging in double figures.  TIP-INS  1. Holiday became the first UCLA player to record at least 33 points and 11 rebounds in a game since Ed O\u2019Bannon had 37 points and 13 rebounds in a 100-77 victory over Duke on Feb. 26, 1995.  2. Washington had 16 steals and 15 blocks in its 106-55 win over Bethune-Cookman on Dec. 19, the only NCAA team since the 2011-12 season to accomplish that feat.  3. Thybulle is tied for second in the NCAA in steals (44).  PREDICTION: UCLA 83, Washington 78 "

          "body": "The Sacramento Kings showed what they are capable of with a victory over Cleveland on Wednesday and displayed their inconsistency two days later, losing by 10 points to Phoenix at home. The Kings look to find their top form when they continue a six-game homestand Sunday night against the Memphis Grizzlies, who reside in the Western Conference cellar.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Kings guard Bogdan Bogdanovic told the Sacramento Bee on Friday after scoring 13 points. \u201cI can see we were emotional (Wednesday against the Cavaliers) and we lost a lot of energy, but you\u2019ve got to find a way to be ready in two games against different teams.\u201d The Kings - last in the league in scoring at 97 points per game - have dropped three of their last four overall and hope to take care of business against Memphis, which is 1-2 on its five-game Western road trip after a 141-128 loss at Golden State on Saturday. Marc Gasol and Tyreke Evans combined for 49 points in the loss as the Grizzlies scored 13 more than their previous season high, but gave up 10 makes from 3-point range by Stephen Curry. Memphis, which came into the game against Golden State fifth in the league in scoring defense at 101.2, has won only four of its last 25 games.  TV: 7 p.m. ET, FSN Southeast (Memphis), NBCSN California (Sacramento)  ABOUT THE GRIZZLIES (11-25): Gasol drained 10-of-13 from the field, including 4-of-4 from 3-point range, while Evans continued his hot streak with 22 points Saturday as his average slipped slightly to 26.4 over the last five games. Rookie guard Kobi Simmons produced a season-high 17 points against Golden State and former first-round pick Deyonta Davis, a 6-11 center, has drained 8-of-10 from the field and averaged 12 points the last two games - eight above his season mark. Forward JaMychal Green scored 12 on 6-of-16 from the field Saturday after missing three games with a knee injury.  ABOUT THE KINGS (12-23): Veteran forward Zach Randolph tops the team in scoring (15.4) and rebounding (6.8), but has connected on only 19 of his 51 shots in the last four contests. Center Willie Cauley-Stein has picked up some of the slack inside by averaging 16 points and hitting 57.4 percent from field over the last five games while Bogdanovic is shooting 60 percent from the floor in the same span. Buddy Hield (12.5 points) has drained 10-of-20 from behind arc the last four games and fellow guard George Hill is only 1-for-10 in the last three despite shooting 46.1 percent from long range overall.  1. Memphis F Chandler Parsons, who is averaging 8.8 points, missed Saturday\u2019s game with knee soreness and is questionable for Sunday.  2. Sacramento\u2019s rookie PG De\u2019Aaron Fox (quad) has been participating in practice, but is expected to miss his sixth straight game.  3. The Grizzlies have won six of the last eight meetings, but the teams split four contests last season.  PREDICTION: Grizzlies 102, Kings 96 "

The Chargers rebounded from an 0-4 start to remain alive in Week 17 as they seek their first playoff appearance since 2013.  In addition to beating Oakland, the Chargers need Jacksonville to defeat Tennessee and have either Baltimore beat Cincinnati or Miami knock off Buffalo to land a berth. \u201cThe one common denominator is us winning. I can\u2019t find one yet where we can lose and still make it,\u201d quarterback Philip Rivers said at a press conference. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to take care of our business. Obviously, we\u2019re all playing at the same time. We can only control what we can control.\u201d While Los Angeles has a lot for which to play, the Raiders are wrapping up a highly disappointing campaign and looking to end a three-game losing streak. \u201cMy mindset is to prepare like I always do and just go lay it all out there like I always try to,\u201d Oakland quarterback Derek Carr told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m pumped up to play against a division rival. They have a lot that they\u2019re playing for and we want to go in there and finish the season with a win.\u201d  TV: 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS. LINE: Chargers -8. O/U: 42  ABOUT THE RAIDERS (6-9): Carr (3,253 yards, 21 touchdowns) has topped 3,000 yards in all four of his NFL seasons, but this year\u2019s output was a step back from his stellar 2016 campaign in which he threw for 3,937 yards with 28 touchdowns and just six interceptions - half of this season\u2019s total of 12. Turnovers have been a constant problem - the Raiders are 29th in margin at minus-12 - and offensive coordinator Todd Downing accepted responsibility for the drop from sixth in total offense last season to tied for 19th this year. Star pass rusher Khalil Mack has 10.5 sacks, giving him 36.5 over the last three seasons.  ABOUT THE CHARGERS (8-7): Rivers has passed for 4,128 yards with 25 touchdowns and 10 interceptions in a standout campaign and needs just 39 yards to become the ninth player in NFL history to reach 50,000 for his career. Receiver Keenan Allen (93 catches, 1,260 yards) also is chasing a milestone as eight receptions will allow him to break LaDainian Tomlinson\u2019s mark of 100 in 2003 for most in a season in franchise history. The Chargers (plus-10) rank fifth in the takeaway category behind an opportunistic defense led by pass rushers Joey Bosa (11.5 sacks) and Melvin Ingram (10) and cornerback Casey Hayward (four interceptions).  1. The Chargers posted a 17-16 win over Oakland on Oct. 15 to halt a four-game slide in the all-time series.  2. The Raiders are tied for last in the league with five interceptions as CB Sean Smith is the team leader with two.  3. Los Angeles RB Melvin Gordon (1,012 rushing yards) is expected to play despite suffering a sprained left ankle in last Sunday\u2019s win over the New York Jets.  PREDICTION: Chargers 30, Raiders 24 "

Instead, both teams will be playing out the schedule when the Lions host the Packers on Sunday.  Green Bay\u2019s season went off the rails due to injury, with quarterback Aaron Rodgers the most significant of the bunch, and coach Mike McCarthy is looking to give younger players like 24-year wide receiver Trevor Davis a chance in the finale. \u201cHe\u2019ll benefit from playing,\u201d McCarthy told reporters of Davis. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a one-dimensional player. If you look at Trevor\u2019s first two years, when he comes into the game, everyone identifies the speed. He has to be able to do the other things \u2014 the quick gain, the double moves and the ability to run the crossing routes, and route discipline that goes with it. You don\u2019t want to be a guy who can just run deep. He\u2019s doing (those things). He\u2019s working hard at it.\u201d The Lions go into the finale answering questions about the job security of head coach Jim Caldwell, who has yet to win a playoff game in four years with the team. \u201cI appreciate everything Coach Caldwell does,\u201d quarterback Matthew Stafford told reporters. \u201cI think he\u2019s a really good leader of men. I think he does a great job in our locker room, helping get us ready to go play football and the rest is up to the players to go out there and make plays and win games.\u201d  TV: 1 p.m. ET FOX. LINE: Lions -6.5. O/U: 43  ABOUT THE PACKERS (7-8): Green Bay placed Rodgers back on injured reserve and expects to be without several other players, but the healthy ones will play on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s important to play to win,\u201d McCarthy told reporters. \u201cTo me this isn\u2019t preseason. That would be the wrong message to send to locker room, and a terrible message to send to your fans. We\u2019re going there to win, and if our players are healthy I expect them to play.\u201d Brett Hundley will again get the start at quarterback but will likely be without wide receivers Jordy Nelson (shoulder) and Davante Adams (concussion).  ABOUT THE LIONS (8-7): Stafford heads into the final weekend of the season fourth in the NFL in passing yards at 4.123, but Detroit sits last in the NFL in rushing at an average of 78 yards. \u201cMy job is to do whatever I can to help us win games,\u201d offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter told reporters when asked about the struggles in the running game. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve won more than we\u2019ve lost. There\u2019s a bunch of things we could do better. ... We\u2019ve got to keep getting better at everything.\u201d One issue with the running game is a series of injuries along the offensive line, and center Travis Swanson (concussion), guard T.J. Lang (foot) and tackle Rick Wagner (ankle) are all questionable for Sunday.  1. Lions CB Nevin Lawson (concussion) is not practicing this week and is doubtful for the finale.  2. Packers RB Aaron Jones (knee) is doubtful.  3. Detroit snapped a three-game losing streak in the series with a 30-17 win at Green Bay on Nov. 6.  PREDICTION: Lions 27, Packers 21 "

The Vikings have even bigger fish to fry on Sunday, as they\u2019ll bid to secure a first-round bye with a victory over the visiting Bears at U.S. Bank Stadium.  \u201cI think this is the first time in my career where you can officially say this game counts as more than one,\u201d Minnesota tight end Kyle Rudolph said. \u201c... This week counts as two wins, essentially. If we can go out and get a win, it guarantees us that we get next week off.\u201d The Vikings are bidding for their fourth season sweep of the Bears since 2000, although they could also receive a first-round bye if Carolina falls to Atlanta. Chicago has won two of three in what has been another difficult season under the watch of John Fox, who has heard rumblings about his job after posting a 14-33 mark at the helm in the Windy City. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ve never had trouble getting employment in this league and I\u2019m not going to start worrying about it now,\u201d Fox said.  TV: 1 p.m. ET, FOX. LINE: Vikings -11.5.

Just letting the game slow down and just playing, instead of thinking.\u201d Trubisky completed just 12 of 25 passes for 128 yards with a touchdown and one interception in the first meeting, but has settled in to throw for a franchise rookie-best 2,015 yards.  ABOUT THE VIKINGS (12-3): Jerick McKinnon totaled his second-best career total in scrimmage yards with 146 in the previous encounter with Chicago, highlighted by a 55-yard touchdown run. Fellow running back Latavius Murray stepped in for flashy rookie Dalvin Cook and had 12 carries for 31 yards before slowly taking the reins in the backfield. A potent running game and stifling defense helped Case Keenum emerge victorious despite completing just 14 of 25 for 139 yards and a touchdown in Saturday\u2019s 16-0 win over Green Bay. Stefon Diggs found the end zone in back-to-back weeks, but was limited to just one catch for four yards in the previous meeting with the Bears.  1. Minnesota S Harrison Smith was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week after recording two interceptions versus Green Bay.  2. Chicago RB Jordan Howard, who has an NFL fifth-best 1,113 rushing yards, ran for two touchdowns last week and has 262 scrimmage yards and four rushing TDs in his past three games.  3.

The Falcons need a win or a Seattle loss to claim the final playoff spot in the NFC.  Atlanta was knocked out of contention for the division title with a 23-13 loss at New Orleans last week, while Carolina kept alive its hopes of a division crown when Cam Newton\u2019s rushing touchdown with 35 seconds left lifted the Panthers to a 22-19 win over Tampa Bay. The Panthers could still end up seeded anywhere from second to fifth in the NFC playoffs, though they need a win and some help from multiple other teams to improve upon the No. 5 seed they\u2019re in line for with a loss or a New Orleans victory at Tampa Bay. Regardless, Carolina plans to play its starters and play to win, perhaps while keeping one eye on the scoreboard in case the result becomes irrelevant. The Panthers, who have won seven of their last eight, snapped a three-game losing streak against the Falcons with a 20-17 home win in Week 9.  TV: 4:25 p.m. ET, FOX. LINE: Atlanta -4. O/U: 45.

The guys who power that ground game \u2013 Newton and running backs Jonathan Stewart and Christian McCaffrey \u2013 will be among the first relegated to the bench if the Saints open a big lead against the Buccaneers. The defense that was dominant early in the season has given up bigger chunks of yardage of late but also has forced 10 turnovers in the past three games.  ABOUT THE FALCONS (9-6): Atlanta has crept into the top 10 in the league in total offense after a slow start, but the Falcons managed only 331 total yards in last week\u2019s loss at New Orleans. Matt Ryan is likely to surpass 4,000 passing yards for the seventh straight season, but his numbers represent a big dropoff from a year ago, and star receiver Julio Jones is battling ankle and thumb injuries. The defense has been excellent against the run most of the season but especially of late, holding three straight opponents and four of the last five under 100 rushing yards.  1. Ryan has averaged 349.8 passing yards with nine touchdowns and two interceptions in his past four games against the Panthers.  2. Carolina DEs Julius Peppers (11) and Mario Addison (10.5) are the only pair of NFC teammates with double-digit sacks.  3.

The Jets are a bitter rival of the Patriots, who had to overcome a 14-point deficit in a 24-17 win over New York in Week 6.  New England knows the value of securing home field \u2014 it has advanced to the Super Bowl in five of the six seasons in which it had the No. 1 seed and hoisted the Lombardi Trophy three of those times (2003, 2014, 2016). Coach Bill Belichick was peppered with questions about the Patriots\u2019 surprise signing of veteran Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison earlier this week but left no doubt where his focus is. \u201cWell, we\u2019re playing the Jets this week,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what that has to do with it. Maybe I\u2019m missing something.

Christian Hackenberg, a second-round pick out of Penn State in 2016, has yet to take a snap in the NFL but reportedly has been working with the first team in practice this week and may see the field against New England. Tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins had eight catches for 46 yards and a TD in the first meeting while Jermaine Kearse and Robby Anderson combined for eight receptions for 155 yards. Defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson is expected to be inactive for the third straight game.  ABOUT THE PATRIOTS (12-3): Tom Brady leads the NFL with 4,387 yards passing, but he has four touchdowns and four interceptions over the past three games and completed only 52.8 percent of his passes in the earlier matchup against the Jets. One potential concern for New England \u2014 star tight end Rob Gronkowski, who snagged both of Brady\u2019s scoring passes in Week 5, was not at the portion of practice open to the media on Thursday, although he\u2019s not listed on the injury report. Running back Dion Lewis was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week after scoring twice and setting season highs with 129 yards on 24 carries in last week\u2019s 37-16 win over Buffalo. The Patriots rank among the bottom fourth in the league with an average of 119.7 yards rushing allowed.  1. Brady has 11 TD passes and zero interceptions in his last five home games versus New York.  2. Jets RB Bilal Powell, who missed the earlier matchup, has rushed for a TD in three of his last four games.  3. The Patriots have won lost 11 of the last 13 regular-season meetings.

          "body": "(Repeats to additional clients; no change in text.)  LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Britain may impose new taxes on tech giants like Google and Facebook unless they do more to combat online extremism by taking down material aimed at radicalising people or helping them to prepare attacks, the country\u2019s security minister said.  Ben Wallace accused tech firms of being happy to sell people\u2019s data but not to give it to the government which was being forced to spend vast sums on de-radicalisation programmes, surveillance and other counter-terrorism measures.  \u201cIf they continue to be less than co-operative, we should look at things like tax as a way of incentivis\u00ading them or compen\u00adsating for their inaction,\u201d Wallace told the Sunday Times newspaper in an interview.  He accused the tech giants of putting private profit before public safety.  \u201cWe should stop pretending that because they sit on beanbags in T-shirts they are not ruthless profiteers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will ruthlessly sell our details to loans and soft-porn companies but not give it to our democratically elected government.\u201d  Britain suffered a series of attacks by Islamic extremists between March and June this year that killed a total of 36 people.  Two involved vehicles ramming people on bridges in London, followed by attackers stabbing people. The deadliest, a bombing at a concert in the northern city of Manchester, killed 22 people.  Following the second bridge attack, Prime Minister Theresa May proposed beefing up regulations on cyberspace, and weeks later interior minister Amber Rudd travelled to California to ask Silicon Valley to step up efforts against extremism.  The Sunday Times quoted Wallace as saying that reliance on the internet made Britain vulnerable to terrorists and rogue states.  \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me awake at night. We are more vulnerable than at any point in the last 100 years,\u201d he said.  Tech companies have made life too easy for attackers by refusing to take down extremist material and bomb-making guides, the minister said. Encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp were also a major problem, he said.  \u201cI have to have more human surveillance. It\u2019s costing hundreds of millions of pounds,\u201d Wallace said.  \u201cBecause content is not being taken down as quickly as they could do, we\u2019re having to de-radicalise people who have been radicalised. That\u2019s costing millions. They can\u2019t get away with that and we should look at all the options, including tax.\u201d  Wallace\u2019s quotes did not give further details on tax plans. The Sunday Times reported that any demand would take the form of a windfall tax similar to that imposed on privatised utilities by former Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s government in 1997.

Ben Wallace accused tech firms of being happy to sell people\u2019s data but not to give it to the government which was being forced to spend vast sums on de-radicalisation programmes, surveillance and other counter-terrorism measures.  \u201cIf they continue to be less than co-operative, we should look at things like tax as a way of incentivis\u00ading them or compen\u00adsating for their inaction,\u201d Wallace told the Sunday Times newspaper in an interview.  He accused the tech giants of putting private profit before public safety.  \u201cWe should stop pretending that because they sit on beanbags in T-shirts they are not ruthless profiteers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will ruthlessly sell our details to loans and soft-porn companies but not give it to our democratically elected government.\u201d  Britain suffered a series of attacks by Islamic extremists between March and June this year that killed a total of 36 people.  Two involved vehicles ramming people on bridges in London, followed by attackers stabbing people. The deadliest, a bombing at a concert in the northern city of Manchester, killed 22 people.  Following the second bridge attack, Prime Minister Theresa May proposed beefing up regulations on cyberspace, and weeks later interior minister Amber Rudd travelled to California to ask Silicon Valley to step up efforts against extremism.  The Sunday Times quoted Wallace as saying that reliance on the internet made Britain vulnerable to terrorists and rogue states.  \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me awake at night. We are more vulnerable than at any point in the last 100 years,\u201d he said.  Tech companies have made life too easy for attackers by refusing to take down extremist material and bomb-making guides, the minister said. Encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp were also a major problem, he said.  \u201cI have to have more human surveillance. It\u2019s costing hundreds of millions of pounds,\u201d Wallace said.  \u201cBecause content is not being taken down as quickly as they could do, we\u2019re having to de-radicalise people who have been radicalised. That\u2019s costing millions. They can\u2019t get away with that and we should look at all the options, including tax.\u201d  Wallace\u2019s quotes did not give further details on tax plans. The Sunday Times reported that any demand would take the form of a windfall tax similar to that imposed on privatised utilities by former Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s government in 1997.

          "body": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police have detained 20 people, including 15 foreign nationals, on suspicion of links to Islamic State during raids in Istanbul, tightening security ahead of the anniversary of a nightclub attack in which dozens were killed.  The raids by the anti-terrorist branch of the Istanbul police took place on Saturday and targeted four locations across the city, the police said in a statement on Sunday. They did not give the nationalities of the foreign suspects.  The state-run Anadolu news agency said the suspects were believed to have been planning an attack during New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations in the city.   Turkish police have been ramping up operations against suspected Islamic State militants in recent days, detaining around 195 on Thursday and Friday.  During New Year\u2019s celebrations a year ago, a man with an assault rifle shot dead 39 people including Turks and visitors from several Arab nations, India and Canada at an exclusive nightclub in Istanbul, the country\u2019s biggest city.  Islamic State claimed responsibility for that shooting, one of a series of attacks believed to have been carried out by the jihadists and Kurdish militants in Turkey in the last couple of years. A trial of those allegedly involved in the nightclub attack began this month.  On New Year\u2019s Eve, the number of police officers on duty in Istanbul will be doubled to 37,000 and public celebrations will be canceled or banned in some districts for security reasons, officials have said.  Many roads in central Istanbul districts will be closed, while heavy vehicles will not be allowed to enter some areas, police have also said.

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean authorities have seized a Panama-flagged vessel suspected of transferring oil products to North Korea in violation of international sanctions, a customs official said on Sunday.  The seizure was the second to be revealed by South Korea within a few days, as the United Nations steps up efforts to squeeze essential oil supplies to the reclusive North following its nuclear or ballistic missile tests.  The ship, KOTI, was seized at Pyeongtaek-Dangjin port, the official told Reuters, without elaborating, due to the sensitivity of the issue. The port is on the west coast, south of Incheon.   A marine official also confirmed the seizure, which he said was done \u201crecently\u201d.   The KOTI\u2019s estimated time of arrival at the port was Dec. 19, according to VesselFinder Ltd., a tracking service provider,   The ship can carry 5,100 tonnes of oil and has a crew mostly from China and Myanmar, Yonhap News Agency reported, adding that South Korea\u2019s intelligence and customs officials are conducting a joint probe into the vessel.  A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed the probe, declining to provide details.   \u201cThe government has been in close consultations with related countries and ministries to thoroughly implement the sanctions by the U.N. Security Council,\u201d the spokesman said.  On Friday, South Korea said that in late November it seized the Hong Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore, which is suspected of transferring as much as 600 tons of oil to the North Korea-flagged Sam Jong 2.  The U.N. Security Council last month unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.  The United States has also proposed that the United Nations Security Council blacklist 10 ships for transporting banned items from North Korea, according to documents seen by Reuters on Tuesday.  The Lighthouse Winmore is one of the 10 ships proposed to be blacklisted. The KOTI does not seem to be included on the list.   On Thursday, China blocked a U.S. effort at the United Nations to blacklist six foreign-flagged ships, a U.N. Security Council diplomat said.  China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, responding to a question from Reuters on the blocking, said Beijing always fully and strictly implemented Security Council resolutions.  \u201cAt the same time, any measures taken by the Security Council must have a basis in conclusive and actual proof. China will continue to participate in the work of the relevant Security Council sanctions committee on this principle,\u201d it said in a short statement, without elaborating.   China also denied reports it had been illicitly selling oil products to North Korea in defiance of U.N. sanctions, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was unhappy that China had allowed oil to reach the isolated nation.       Russian tankers have supplied fuel to North Korea on at least three occasions in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea, breaching U.N. sanctions, sources told Reuters.

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Middle East fund managers plan to boost their equity holdings after a very weak year in which the region underperformed emerging markets globally because of geopolitics and slow economic growth, a Reuters poll showed on Sunday.  Egypt\u2019s stock market surged to record highs in 2017 as economic reforms took hold but Gulf Cooperation Council markets sagged, with Dubai\u2019s index .DFMGI falling 4.6 percent and Saudi Arabia .TASI almost flat. By contrast, MSCI\u2019s emerging markets index .MSCIEF soared 34 percent.  As a result, Middle East and North African equity funds returned just 2.5 percent on average in the year through November, compared with more than 21 percent for global emerging market equity funds, according to calculations by Citywire using data from Lipper, a Reuters company.  \u201cThe year 2017 will long be remembered in the GCC, unfortunately for probably all the wrong reasons,\u201d said Akber Khan, head of asset management at Al Rayan Investment in Doha, where the market was hit by an economic boycott imposed on Qatar by four other Arab states.  The latest monthly Reuters poll of 13 leading regional fund managers, conducted over the past 10 days, shows many funds will bet on 2018 being better.   Fifty-four percent expect to raise their allocations to Middle Eastern equities over the next three months and none to reduce them, the most positive balance since August. In the previous poll, the ratios were 46 percent and zero.  GCC markets\u2019 underperformance has narrowed and in some cases even reversed the region\u2019s longstanding overvaluation compared with emerging markets, managers said.  \u201cRegional stock markets are among the worst performers in the world this year, so valuations are a positive for some stocks,\u201d said Khan.  Meanwhile, the Brent oil price\u2019s LCOc1 surge to 2-1/2 year highs above $65 a barrel in the last few months has given several GCC governments, including Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, room to boost spending moderately in 2018 after over two years of austerity.  \u201cThe equity outlook for 2018 gives us comfort as the biggest revenue generator for the GCC \u2013 crude oil \u2013 has found its base, which has led to more accommodative fiscal policies,\u201d said Bader al-Ghanim, head of regional asset management at Kuwait-based Global Investment House.  \u201cWith this backdrop and underpinned by undemanding valuations, we are generally optimistic on the GCC for the year 2018, with the outlook ranging from slightly negative to moderately bullish across the board.\u201d  However, Ghanim and other managers said geopolitics - including the risk of an escalation in tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia - remained a major risk for the region.  By far the most favored stock market is Saudi Arabia. Sixty-nine percent of managers expect to increase equity allocations there and only 8 percent to reduce them, the most positive balance since March 2017.  A major reason is the release of Riyadh\u2019s state budget in  mid-December; authorities said they would increase spending modestly while pushing back the target date for balancing the budget by three years, partly by spreading hikes in domestic energy prices over a much longer period.  That should allow a rebound of economic growth next year and give the bottom lines of many Saudi companies more time to adjust to painful reforms.  \u201cIt is a positive that the kingdom is moving the target year for eliminating its deficit to 2023 from 2020,\u201d said Vrajesh Bhandari, portfolio manager at Dubai-based Al Mal Capital. \u201cThis suggests continued focus on capital expenditure, which drives economic growth.\u201d  Fund managers are also expecting good news from international index compilers next year. MSCI will announce in June 2018 whether it will add Saudi Arabia to its emerging markets index, while FTSE has said it will probably decide next March to do so.  These decisions, as well as the planned listing of national oil giant Saudi Aramco in Riyadh late next year, may attract new flows of foreign funds to the Saudi market.  A sweeping crackdown on corruption launched by Saudi authorities rattled the stock market briefly in November but managers said it was not a long-term negative for the market, as the effect on the real economy had been negligible.

          "body": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A group of Polish mountaineers set off for northern Pakistan on Sunday to start an attempt to be the first to scale K2, the world\u2019s second highest peak, in wintertime.  K2, in the Karakorum mountains along the border between China and Pakistan, is notorious for high winds, steep and icy slopes - and high fatality rates for climbers. In winter months, scant snowfall means the summit approach can turn into bare ice.  More than 70 people have died climbing the peak, many of them at the Bottleneck, where a wrong step can send a climber hurtling off the South Face, where bodies are unlikely to be recovered.  Team member Adam Bielecki, 34, told Reuters that the chance to make history is a \u201cstrong motivation\u201d for the Polish group.  Polish climbers have written a \u201cbeautiful chapter\u201d of exploring peaks of more than 8,000 meters (26,247 feet), and scaling K2 in winter would \u201cthe last chapter of this book\u201d.   The Polish team comprises 13 mountaineers led by Krzysztof Wielicki, 67, who in 2003 headed a winter expedition of K2, which was unable to clear the 8,000 meter threshold.  K2, slightly shorter than Mount Everest, is 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) high.  Wielicki told Reuters that his team would begin their ascent on Jan. 8 or 9 and, if successful, expect to return to base camp by mid-March.  Pakistan is a hot destination for climbers. It rivals Nepal for the number of peaks over 7,000 meters (22,966 feet) and in all, it has five of the world\u2019s 14 summits higher than 8,000 meters.   Bielecki said the group expects to be away from home for around three months.  \u201cIf you ask me what\u2019s the hardest part of the expedition or what I fear the most, it\u2019s actually the separation from my family,\u201d he said.

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Street protests hit Iran for a third day running on Saturday, spreading to the capital Tehran with crowds confronting police and attacking some state buildings, and a social media report said two demonstrators had been shot dead in a provincial town.  The wave of anti-government demonstrations, prompted in part by discontent over economic hardship and alleged corruption, are the most serious since months of unrest in 2009 that followed the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Saturday\u2019s protests, in fact, coincided with state-sponsored rallies staged across the Islamic Republic to mark the final suppression of the 2009 unrest by security forces, with mass pro-government events in Tehran and Mashhad, Iran\u2019s second city.  Pro-government rallies were held in some 1,200 cities and towns in all, state television reported.  At the same time, anti-government demonstrations broke out anew in a string of cities and in Tehran for the first time where protesters confronted and stoned riot police around the main university, with pro-government crowds nearby.     Videos posted on social media from the western town of Dorud showed two young men lying motionless on the ground, covered with blood, and a voiceover said they had been shot dead by riot police firing on protesters.  Other protesters in the video chanted, \u201cI will kill whoever killed my brother!\u201d The video, like others posted during the current protest wave, could not be immediately authenticated.  In earlier footage, marchers in Dorud shouted, \u201cDeath to the dictator,\u201d referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  Social media video from Mashhad showed protesters overturning a riot police car and police motorcycles set ablaze.  In Tehran, the semi-official news agency Fars said up to 70 students gathered in front of its main university and hurled rocks at police, also chanting, \u201cDeath to the dictator.\u201d  Social media footage showed riot police using clubs to disperse more protesters marching in nearby streets, and arresting some of them. The student news agency ISNA said police shut two metro stations to prevent more protesters arriving.  In Tehran and Karaj west of the capital, protesters smashed windows on state buildings and set fires in the streets.  Images carried by the semi-official news agency Tasnim showed burning garbage bins and smashed-up bus shelters in the street lining the university after the protests subsided.  Brigadier-General Esmail Kowsari, the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 deputy security chief in Tehran, said the situation in the capital was under control and warned protesters would face \u201cthe nation\u2019s iron fist\u201d if unrest persisted.  \u201cIf people came into the streets over high prices, they should not have chanted those (anti-government) slogans and burned public property and cars,\u201d Kowsari told ISNA.  The United States condemned the scores of arrests of protesters reported by Iranian media since Thursday.  President Donald Trump tweeted, \u201cThe entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran\u2019s people are what their leaders fear the most.\u201d  State media quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi as saying in response to an earlier Trump tweet criticizing the arrests: \u201cThe Iranian people see no value in the opportunistic claims by American officials and Mr. Trump.\u201d  The Telegram messaging app, with 40 million users in Iran, on Saturday blocked a channel that Iran\u2019s telecommunications minister had accused of encouraging violence in the unrest, its Chief Executive Officer Pavel Durov said on Twitter.  Iranian media and social media also reported protests in the cities of Kashan, Arak, Ahvaz, Zanjan, Bandar Abbas and Kerman.  The elite Revolutionary Guards and its Basij militia, which spearheaded the security crackdown that crushed the protests of 2009, said in a statement carried by state media: \u201cThe Iranian nation ... will not allow the country to be hurt.\u201d    Openly political protests are rare in the Islamic Republic, where security services are omnipresent.  But there is considerable discontent over high unemployment, inflation and alleged graft. Some of the new protests have  turned political over issues including Iran\u2019s costly involvement in regional conflicts such as those in Syria and Iraq.  Joblessness has risen and annual inflation is running at about 8 percent, with shortages of some foods contributing to higher prices and hardship for many families.   Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli warned against attempts to promote protests via social media.  \u201cWe ask people not to take part in unlawful gatherings. If they plan a gathering they should apply (for a permit),\u201d he told the Young Journalists Club news website.  On Thursday, hundreds of people took to the streets in Mashhad, one of the holiest places in Shi\u2019ite Islam, to protest against high prices, shouting anti-government slogans. Police arrested 52 people, according to a judicial official.  State broadcaster IRIB said on its website it had not covered the protests after being told by authorities that \u201cthe issue should not be reflected on state radio and television\u201d.  Most of those arrested in the last two days had been released, state television said, without giving details.  \u201cEnemy websites and foreign media continue to try to exploit economic hardships and the legitimate demands of the people...to launch illegal gatherings and possible unrest,\u201d it said.  Though purely political protests are seldom seen in Iran, demonstrations are often held by workers over lay-offs or non-payment of salaries and by people who hold deposits in non-regulated, bankrupt financial institutions.   President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s leading achievement, a 2015 deal with world powers that curbed Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for a lifting of most international sanctions, has yet to bring the broad economic benefits the government says are coming.   Unemployment has risen to 12.4 percent this fiscal year, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran, up 1.4 percentage points and leaving about 3.2 million Iranians jobless.

          "body": "SEOUL, Dec 31 (Reuters) - South Korean authorities have seized a Panama-flagged vessel suspected of transferring oil products to North Korea in violation of international sanctions, a customs official said on Sunday.  The KOTI was seized at Pyeongtaek-Dangjin port, the official told Reuters, without elaborating, due to the sensitivity of the issue. The port is on the west coast south of Incheon.  The ship can carry 5,100 tonnes of oil and has a crew mostly from China and Myanmar, Yonhap News Agency reported, adding that South Korea\u2019s intelligence and customs officials are conducting a joint probe into the vessel.  The official did not say when authorities moved in, but the seizure was the second to be revealed within just a few days.  South Korea said on Friday that in late November it had seized the Hong Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore, which is suspected of transferring as much as 600 tons of oil to the North Korea-flagged Sam Jong 2.  The U.N. Security Council last month unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.  The United States has also proposed that the United Nations Security Council blacklist 10 ships for transporting banned items from North Korea, according to documents seen by Reuters on Tuesday.  The Lighthouse Winmore is one of the 10 ships proposed to be blacklisted. The KOTI does not seem to be included on the list.  China on Friday denied reports it had been illicitly selling oil products to North Korea in defiance of U.N. sanctions, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was unhappy that China had allowed oil to reach the isolated nation.

          "body": "(Reuters) - No Powerball tickets matched all six numbers for Saturday night\u2019s $384 million grand prize drawing, sending next week\u2019s jackpot in the United States surging to $440 million, lottery officials said.  The estimated $440 million prize, with a cash value of $278 million, marks the ninth largest jackpot in the game\u2019s history, according to figures on the Powerball website.  The cash value figure is the estimated total if a winner selects one lump-sum payment, rather than the other option of taking annual payments over 30 years.  Both estimated totals are before any taxes are assessed.  The winning numbers for Saturday\u2019s drawing were: 28, 36, 41, 51, 58 and the Powerball of 24.  The odds of a single ticket hitting all six numbers are 292 million to one, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.  The largest Powerball jackpot was $1.6 billion payout split among winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016.  The record Powerball winner for a single ticket buyer is $758 million. won by a Massachusetts woman in August this year.  Powerball tickets are sold in 44 U.S. states, and Washington, D.C.; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Drawings are held twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday nights.

Cory Schneider made 30 saves for the Devils, who fell one point behind Washington.  Bruins 5, Senators 0  Ryan Spooner had two goals and an assist, and David Krejci had a goal and an assist to lead Boston.

          "body": "Doughty lifts Kings by Canucks  VANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Drew Doughty wanted to make amends.  The Los Angeles Kings\u2019 defenseman was angry with himself after a mistake he made in the second period cost his team a goal. Doughty made things right by scoring 6:49 into the third period to break a tie as the Kings defeated the Vancouver Canucks 4-3 Saturday night to end a two-game losing streak.  Doughty was frustrated when Vancouver\u2019s Nikolay Goldobin scored at 17:31 of the second period. Goldobin took a pass from teammate Ben Hutton, then used a toe drag to get around Doughty and score on a backhand.  \u201cI was pretty embarrassed,\u201d Doughty said about the play. \u201cI don\u2019t get dangled very often ... only the second time I can remember in my NHL career where I got dangled for a goal.  \u201cI was pretty embarrassed and (mad) at myself going into the third period. I knew I was going to do everything in my power to try to help us win that game.\u201d  Doughty\u2019s deciding goal came early in the period. Skating untouched in the slot, he took a shot that hit defenseman Alex Elder. Doughty collected the rebound and took another shot that beat Canucks goaltender Jacob Markstrom under the blocker for his seventh goal and 29th point of the season.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why I had that much ice, but I did,\u201d he said. \u201cI just tried to get to the middle of the ice to get a better angle at the goalie and try to get a shot through. Edler did a good job blocking it.  \u201cLuckily I got it back on my tape and just shot it again. When you get in that tight and that close to the goalie, you\u2019ve got to rip it.\u201d  Kings coach John Stevens said it\u2019s rare for Doughty to be beaten on a play like on Goldobin\u2019s goal.  \u201cIt\u2019s not very often you see that,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cGreat players have a short memory.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect to see it again for a while.\u201d  Tyler Toffoli had a goal and two assists for the Kings (23-11-5) while Marian Gaborik had a goal and an assist. Kyle Clifford also scored, and Trevor Lewis added two assists for the Kings, who are 3-3-2 in their last eight games.  The Kings trailed twice in the game. They fell behind 1-0 early in the first period and 3-2 with just 41 seconds gone in the third.  Clifford, who missed 31 games with an upper-body injury, tied the game 3-3 at 2:22 of the third on a scramble in front of the Canucks goal. Doughty scored 2 1/2 minutes later.  \u201cWe always have resilience,\u201d said Doughty, \u201cWe just don\u2019t give up. It doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re down, if we\u2019re up.\u201d  Clifford was thrilled his first goal of the season came at a key time.  \u201cIt\u2019s just good to be back with the guys,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a long stint there with the recovery but it\u2019s just good to be back.  \u201cEverybody contributed tonight.\u201d  Nic Dowd, who was playing in his 100th NHL game, and Troy Stecher, with his first of the year, scored for the Canucks (16-18-5). Vancouver is 2-8-1 in the last 11 games. Defenseman Ben Hutton had two assists.  Canucks captain Henrik Sedin was frustrated his team lost another game they easily could have won.  \u201cThere have been a few of those through this stretch where we have been on the wrong side of things,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference right now between being right there for a playoff spot. Now we have to battle to get back there.\u201d  Stecher said little mistakes are making things miserable for the Canucks.  \u201cThis league, every little mistake is costly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to find ways to win games. One goal games, you have to find a way to be on the good side.\u201d  Markstrom said the Canucks can\u2019t afford to keep losing.  \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe league is close right now.  \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fall behind. We talk about putting games together and putting wins together and we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d  Markstrom finished the night with 32 saves. Los Angeles goalie Jonathan Quick, who was making his fifth consecutive start, stopped 22 shots.  NOTES: Vancouver LW Brendan Gaunce and RW Jake Virtanen were playing their 100th NHL games. ... Vancouver D Chris Tanev (groin) missed his seventh game but could return Tuesday against Anaheim. Canucks C Michael Chaput dressed after being called up from Utica of the AHL. ...

          "body": "India\u2019s key indices posted their best annual gains in three years, with the Nifty up 29 percent to close 2017 at 10,531. The Nifty mid-cap outperformed with 47 percent gains, mostly driven by government reforms, the relentless flow of liquidity, positive outcome of the Gujarat election and optimism of growth going ahead.  Among sectors, Nifty Bank, FMCG, Auto and Metal indices rallied 30-48 percent while the IT index rose 12 percent. The Pharma index fell 6 percent for the year due to various regulatory concerns.   Commodity markets also had a good rally with crude gaining more than 10 percent. Gold rose 13 percent while silver was lacklustre, gaining just 5.5 percent.  FIIs maintained their selling spree for the third straight year in 2017 to the tune of 447 billion rupees ($7 billion). DIIs on the other hand pumped in a record 903 billion rupees ($14 billion) into equities during the year.  For the week, the Nifty managed to eke out small gains (0.4 percent). Optimism prevailed after SEBI\u2019s decision to allow exchanges to provide equity and commodity trading from next year and relax entry norms for foreign portfolio investors.  Traders shrugged off concerns related to fiscal deficit after recent data indicated that the government had breached its target. Reliance Communications\u2019 debt restructuring plan came as a breather to the investors and banks.  Brent crude hovered near 2015 highs at $66.23 on the back of an outlook for healthy demand amid ongoing production cuts led by OPEC and Russia. The rupee strengthened by 20 paisa during the week to 63.87 a dollar.   The finance ministry came out with a statement highlighting the risks of investing in crypto-currencies, comparing it to a Ponzi scheme. The value of bitcoin has jumped more than 1,700 percent in 2017 and is trading near the $14,000 mark.  On the macroeconomic and interest rate front, Moody\u2019s believes that the continued impact of the HRA revision on housing inflation and elevated fuel prices suggest that CPI inflation is likely to remain in a range of 4.4-4.7 percent for the remainder of FY2018, above the RBI\u2019s comfort zone of 4 percent. Volatility in the monthly CPI inflation readings would persist and thus the RBI is expected to hold rates for an extended period.  The fiscal deficit reached 6.12 trillion rupees ($95.77 billion) or 112 percent of the budgeted target for 2017-18. The government also announced an additional borrowing of 500 billion rupees. With this, the fiscal gap for the current year is likely in the range of 3.5-3.7 percent of GDP.   Monthly GST collection declined to its lowest level since its rollout. The government collected 808 billion rupees ($12.6 billion) for November. That compares with 833 billion rupees in October, 921 billion rupees in September, 907 billion rupees in August and 923 billion rupees in July.   The dip in collection is a matter of concern and can be attributed to lowering of rates in mid-November, though the expansion of tax base should have offset the lower rates.   On the stock specific front, Reliance Communications was the best performer during the week. It gained in excess of 100 percent after it announced its debt resolution plan. The entire monetisation process to repay its debt to lenders will be completed by January-March 2018 as it transforms into a B2B operation.   In the first trading week of the New Year, markets will start training their focus on corporate results for the third quarter and the upcoming Union Budget.   Market participants have already started building up their budget-related expectations, the prime ones related to increased allocations for rural and urban infrastructure.   Focus will also be on rising crude oil prices, inflation and fiscal deficit.   Government bond yields are set to harden as investors expect the RBI to start reversing its easing cycle during the year amid risks of higher retail inflation and concerns over higher government borrowings over the next three months.   Globally, major central banks would be on track to trim their balance sheets and hike rates. Though this will be on expected lines, there could be trouble for emerging markets as liquidity would be constrained and there could be withdrawal from bond markets.  On the macro front, manufacturing PMI for December will be unveiled on Tuesday, while Services sector PMI for December will be declared on Thursday.   Despite rising oil prices and the risk of fiscal slippage, fund flows would continue to chase momentum in the New Year. Investors should now focus on protecting their capital after witnessing huge gains in 2017.

          "body": "Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are expected to keep rising in 2018 because a massive drop in the corporate tax rate is seen boosting the economy and corporate profits, but strategists say sizable gains could either be short-lived or elusive.  The bull market is on track to mark its ninth birthday in March, with the S&P 500 climbing 20 percent for 2017 - its biggest increase since 2013. The drop in the corporate tax rate in 2018, to 21 percent from 35 percent, is seen by many as the biggest factor for the stock market next year.  Yet 2018 share gains are expected to be smaller than 2017 with the S&P 500\u2019s price/earnings ratio - a measure of stock prices against expected profits - is around its highest level since June 2002. Many on Wall Street cite potential pitfalls even though they see no signs of a recession.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had six years in a row where stocks have (outperformed) earnings, and I think we break that streak with stocks going up but not as much as earnings,\u201d said Robert Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management in Princeton, New Jersey.  Some say the tax bill\u2019s benefit will be short lived. David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management described the bill as \u201cmore carbs and less protein,\u201d because the tax overhaul will improve spending but does nothing to boost productivity.  \u201cIt\u2019ll be a one-year wonder,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cPeople should enjoy the party while it lasts but just make sure you know where your coat is.\u201d  Several strategists cite the risk that faster economic growth could cause inflation to increase at a pace that would lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than expected.  Wall Street\u2019s rosy forecasts seem \u201cwell supported by the tremendous string of good news which the economy has delivered,\u201d according to Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist with Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.  But he said, the news is too good: \u201cThe problem with getting good news is that at some point you can\u2019t be positively surprised any more.\u201d  Paulsen does not expect a recession. But when the economic surprise index - which compares economic data to consensus expectations - is at high levels, equity performance tends to be weaker, according to Paulsen.  The Citi Economic Surprise index was at 77 on Thursday, not far from its almost six-year high of 84.5 reached on Dec. 22.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a 10-15 percent correction at some time in 2018. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we\u2019re down for the year,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cIf we get a correction and people get scared I\u2019ll probably be buying again.\u201d  Investors will keep a close watch on the on U.S. mid-term elections in 2018 because a Republican loss of control of the Senate or the House of Representatives could stall the party\u2019s agenda. In 10 of the last 17 U.S. mid-term election years, equity price moves for the full year followed January\u2019s direction, according to Jeff Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac.  Investor moods in January may depend on whether the U.S. Congress reaches an agreement to raise the country\u2019s debt ceiling. Investors will also be hoping Congress can reach a 2018 budget pact by Jan. 19. These are just some of the worries traders are contending with.  But the market has history against it. The S&P 500 rises on average 1.3 percent in the so-called Santa Clause rally - the period between Dec. 22 and Jan. 3 - according to Hirsch. This year, five days in, the S&P has risen just 0.1 percent.  \u201cThe failure of stocks to rally during this time tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased at lower prices later in the year,\u201d Hirsch wrote in a blog post.

          "body": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A big star of India\u2019s Tamil-language movies, Rajinikanth, said on Sunday he is launching a political party, adding drama to a heated political scene in a state with a history of film stars becoming chief ministers.  Tamil Nadu, which accounts for the bulk of India\u2019s automobile exports, has been in political limbo since the death of Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa in December 2016. Jayalalithaa was a popular actress before joining politics.  Rajinikanth, called the \u201csuperstar\u201d by his fans, enters the  political scene at a time Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s party is looking to make inroads into the southern state that\u2019s been ruled by two south Indian parties for decades.  Over the past five decades, Tamil Nadu has chosen between the two Dravidian parties, both of which claim anti-caste social justice and secularism as their core ideology.  Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not win a seat in Tamil Nadu\u2019s 2016 elections. The next state election is due in 2021.  \u201cI\u2019ll push for spiritual politics without caste or religious leanings,\u201d Rajinikanth said. \u201cIf I come to power and am not able to deliver in three years, I\u2019ll resign. Democracy is in a state of distress in the state.\u201d  In Tamil cinema, Rajinikanth often plays larger-than-life characters that project him as a savior of the masses. The actor, who has been in a few Hindi movies, has created a frenzy among fans ahead of every release.  But opponents say politics would be different.  Subramanian Swamy, a BJP leader, dismissed Rajinikanth\u2019s plunge into politics as \u201cmedia hype\u201d.  Tamil Nadu, a state of more than 70 million people, is sometimes called the \u201cDetroit of Asia\u201d. It is home to factories of companies including BMW, Daimler, Hyundai, Ford, Nissan and Renault.  Reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Richard Borsuk"

          "title": "Hornibrook leads Wisconsin to Orange Bowl victory",
          "body": "Hornibrook leads Wisconsin to Orange Bowl victory  MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \u2014 The Wisconsin Badgers seniors went out with more wins than any other class in school history.  But on Saturday night in the annual Orange Bowl Classic, it was the underclassmen who stole the show.  Sophomore Alex Hornibrook passed for a career-high-tying four touchdowns to lead the No. 6 Wisconsin Badgers to a 34-24 win over the No. 10 Miami Hurricanes at Hard Rock Stadium.  Freshman Danny Davis, who had scored just twice this season entering Saturday, caught three of the touchdown passes, and junior outside linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel had an interception that changed the momentum of the game.  \u201cOur defense has been doing that all year,\u201d Hornibrook said of Van Ginkel\u2019s play that sparked a rally from a 14-3 deficit. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s wrong or not, but every time we\u2019re on defense, I expect an interception.\u201d  Hornibrook didn\u2019t throw any interceptions against the \u201cTurnover Chain\u201d Miami defense that was surely hunting for picks.  The Wisconsin second-year starter completed 23-of-34 passes for a season-best 258 yards as the Badgers (13-1) completed the first 13-win season in program history.  This senior class set a Wisconsin record with 45 wins, getting double-figure victories four years in a row.  Meanwhile, Miami (10-3), after ranking as high as No. 2 in the nation earlier in the season, closed the year with three consecutive losses.  Hurricanes quarterback Malik Rosier passed for 203 yards and one touchdown and also ran for 41 yards. But he threw three costly interceptions.  \u201cThey did a really good job of making me throw into tight coverage,\u201d Rosier said. \u201cThey were fast. They were physical. And they did a great job of making me throw low-percentage passes.\u201d  Miami led 14-3 after the first quarter. After a 35-yard field goal by Wisconsin\u2019s Rafael Gaglianone, Miami took a 7-3 lead on Travis Homer\u2019s 5-yard touchdown run.  The Hurricanes got a 39-yard touchdown run by DeeJay Dallas, who took a direct snap and ran around right end and picked up a key block from Rosier.  Wisconsin changed the momentum in the second quarter, and it began with an interception at the line of scrimmage by Van Ginkel, a 6-4 outside linebacker who jumped up on the right side and picked off a Rosier pass at the Miami 23.  \u201c(Miami left tackle Kc McDermott) tried to cut (block Van Ginkel),\u201d Rosier said. \u201c(Van Ginkel) did a great job of using his hands. He got his hands up, and the ball hit him.\u201d  Van Ginkel\u2019s interception led to a 20-yard touchdown pass to Davis, who caught the back-shoulder throw just inside the right sideline and stretched out to reach the pylon.  Hornibrook added a 16-yard pass to A.J. Taylor and a 5-yarder to Davis to give the Badgers a 24-14 halftime lead.  Miami cut its deficit to 24-21 on a 38-yard touchdown pass from Rosier to Lawrence Cager. On the play, Rosier drew defenders toward him when he scrambled to his right, allowing Cager to slip behind the defense.  The teams exchanged field goals \u2014 47 yards by Gaglianone and 41 yards by Michael Badgley \u2014 leaving Wisconsin with a 27-24 lead with 11:34 left in the fourth quarter. With his field goal, Badgley set a Miami career scoring record with 402 points.  Wisconsin extended its lead to 34-24 on a 6-yard toss from Hornibrook to Davis, and Miami blew a chance to close within one score when Badgley missed a 24-yard field-goal try off the right goalpost with 4:34 left in the fourth quarter.  Badgley also missed a 53-yarder in the first quarter.  Predictably, the two head coaches were in different moods after the game.  Miami\u2019s Mark Richt complained about the officiating.  \u201cI don\u2019t agree with a lot of the things that were called or not called,\u201d he said.  On the other side, Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst expressed pride.  \u201cIt takes everyone,\u201d Chryst said. \u201cAnd I think everyone contributed.\u201d  NOTES: In the first half, Badgers RB Jonathan Taylor passed Adrian Peterson for the NCAA single-season rushing record by a freshman. ... Miami QB Malik Rosier finished the season with a program-record 31 touchdowns this year \u2014 26 passing and five rushing. Vinny Testaverde had set the previous record in 1986, when he won the Heisman Trophy. ... Wisconsin OLB Leon Jacobs set a Football Bowl Subdivision mark by playing in his 59th consecutive game. Badgers S Joe Ferguson played in his 58th game, which ranks second on the list. ... Miami was without its top three offensive playmakers: RB Mark Walton, WR Ahmmon Richards and TE Chris Herndon, all out with injuries."

          "body": "No. 17 Arizona upends No. 3 Arizona State  Arizona freshman Deandre Ayton may be understated, but he is hardly not noticeable.  Arizona\u2019s 7-foot-1 phenom was back at his best on Saturday night, scoring 23 points and pulling down 19 rebounds in the Wildcats\u2019 84-78 win over No. 3 Arizona State in the McKale Center in Tucson, Ariz.  \u201cCoach (Sean Miller) broke it down to us that you don\u2019t get excited and that we should play like this every game,\u201d said Ayton, who numbers were good enough for his 10th double-double of the season. \u201cEverything we did earlier in the season you can just scratch that out. We\u2019re just on a roll right now. We\u2019ve just gotta get better and do what we gotta do to get wins.\u201d  His 19 rebounds were a career high.  \u201cDeandre has a great attitude and is fun to coach,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019s an unbelievable teammate. He rises to the challenge; big games bring out the best in him. He was ready for tonight\u2019s game \u2014 thank goodness. We needed that type of effort. When we won the game, it was because of his dominance close to the basket.\u201d  It was Arizona State\u2019s first loss of the season. The Sun Devils (12-1) were the last undefeated college team left \u2014 Villanova and Texas Christian lost earlier in the day. It was Arizona State\u2019s best start in school history.  It\u2019s the first time since 1994-95 each team was ranked in the matchup.  Arizona (11-3), behind Ayton and junior guard Allonzo Trier, was able to hold off a pesky and aggressive Arizona State behind Tra Holder, who scored 31 points, 19 in the second half.  Trier had 23 points, 18 in the second half.  \u201cAllonzo and Deandre, their performance was spectacular,\u201d Miller said.  Twice Arizona led by 12 points in the second half, but Holder all but willed Arizona State to stay close. He hit a 3-pointer with 2:17 to make it 76-73.  Trier followed with a basket only to see Kodi Justice hit a 3-pointer after a turnover. Arizona then called a timeout with a 78-76 lead with 1:12 left.  \u201cThey have the ability to score quickly,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey can change the game in single plays, but they string, three, four, five plays together and are dynamic in transition.\u201d  Ayton tipped in a missed shot by Trier to give Arizona an 80-76 lead with 11 seconds left.  \u201cLate in the game, I felt like (Ayton) was in the paint and he was in there forever,\u201d Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley said. \u201cWhen you give a guy a chance to stay in the paint that long, they\u2019re going to eventually find him and throw him the ball. He\u2019s a pretty big target.\u201d  But Holder was fouled driving to the basket on the next possession. He hit two free throws to make it 80-78.  \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a guard become as good at getting fouled as Tra Holder,\u201d said Miller, who witnessed Holder hit 15 of 16 free throws. \u201cSome teams don\u2019t shoot 16 free throws against us. He\u2019s just so explosive. He\u2019s a monster.\u201d  Trier was fouled with 10.3 seconds left. He hit both free throws to make it 82-78. On Arizona State\u2019s next possession missed a 3-pointer to all but end the game.  Arizona opened the second half with a 10-4 run as Arizona State went 1 of 9 to start the half.  Arizona also took advantage of its large size advantage behind Ayton and Dusan Ristic as they grabbed rebounds and gave Arizona second-chance opportunities.  Ayton continued to run with a strong dunk and a free throw to make it 52-41 with just more than 15 minutes left.  Arizona State\u2019s Shannon Evans didn\u2019t help his team\u2019s cause when he was assessed a technical foul with 12:28 left. Trier hit both free throws to make it 58-48.  Ristic followed with a dunk to give Arizona its largest lead of the game \u2014 62-50 \u2014 with 10:53 left.  Behind Holder\u2019s nine points, Arizona State went on a 11-2 to inch closer at 64-63 with 7:52 left.  Trier hit a 3-pointer to give Arizona some breathing room to make it 69-63 with 6:14 left. And Ayton followed with another basket to make it 71-63.  Arizona State\u2019s Romello White fouled out with Arizona leading 73-64 with 4:50 left. Arizona continued to get the ball to Ayton, who again gave the Wildcats a double-digit lead at 76-64.  \u201cWe are just going to regroup,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cThis is a marathon. It\u2019s fun to be in these games; you live for these games. It was such a hard-fought game. Both teams battling (and) both wanted to win really gad. It was a lot of fun.\u201d  The pace was just as fast and loose in the first half as it was in the second half.  NOTES: Arizona State and Stanford (2000-01) have been the only Pac-12 teams to start 12-0 and have won 11 games by double digits since 1996-97. ... De\u2019Quion Lake entered the game shooting 74.1 percent (40 of 54). He went 3 of 4 on Saturday. ... Sean Miller is 8-1 at home vs. Arizona State. ... Allonzo Trier\u2019s 23 points made him the 56th Arizona player to reach 1,000 points in a career. He\u2019s averaged 17 points in that time. He\u2019d be the eighth Arizona player to do so under Miller ... Arizona is 131-13 at McKale Center under Miller."

          "title": "76ers win again without Embiid",
          "body": "76ers win again without Embiid  DENVER \u2014 Jerryd Bayless isn\u2019t Philadelphia\u2019s go-to guy on offense, but when he got the chance, the veteran came through.  Bayless scored eight of his 14 points in the first 1:06 of the fourth quarter to start a decisive run and the 76ers defeated the Denver Nuggets 107-102 on Saturday night.  Dario Saric had 20 points and nine rebounds, JJ Redick scored 18 points and Robert Covington had 15 points and 10 rebounds for Philadelphia (16-19).  Bayless, who had 14 points combined over the previous three games, matched that in a total span of 3:56. He scored six straight points toward the end of the third quarter and then got hot at the start of the fourth.  \u201cIt was a mix of a lot of things,\u201d Bayless said. \u201cI got some plays called and tried to take advantage of it. My teammates really helped and (coach) Brett (Brown) made some calls for me.\u201d  Jamal Murray led the Nuggets with 31 points, Nikola Jokic had 19 points, 13 rebounds and six assists, and Gary Harris added 17 points for Denver (19-17).  Trey Lyles added 16 points and eight rebounds for the Nuggets, who have lost two of their last three home games.  The Sixers improved to 2-7 without center Joel Embiid. Embiid flew straight from Portland to Phoenix, where Philadelphia plays on Sunday night. Brown said Embiid went through a workout Saturday and will be ready to go against the Suns.  He\u2019ll join a team on a high after winning in a tough environment.  \u201cIt feels good. It was a big one, we needed this, and now we\u2019ve just got to keep trending like this in the right direction,\u201d Bayless said.  Nuggets coach Michael Malone was leery of playing the Sixers without their star.  \u201cI was scared. I did not have a good feeling all day because I know what happens when you have a star out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can tell them not to relax but at the end of the day those guys have good players.\u201d  Philadelphia missed its first nine shots of the third quarter \u2014 and 10 in a row overall \u2014 when the Nuggets went on an 11-0 run to take a 14-point lead. The Sixers didn\u2019t get their first points of the second half until nearly five minutes in, and those came on free throws by Saric.  Saric broke the field-goal drought with a 3-pointer as Philadelphia responded with 11 straight points and a 25-4 run to make it take a seven-point lead late in the third quarter.  During the run, the Sixers began intentionally fouling Mason Plumlee, a 40.2 shooter from the line, to disrupt Denver\u2019s offense.  \u201cWe tried to foul Mason Plumlee and I think that it helped us,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou\u2019re always staring at 2 minutes up because you can\u2019t do it after that unless he has the ball. I thought we did a pretty good job of fouling him prior to the 2 minutes, and we did a good job of fouling him when he had the ball.\u201d  The strategy worked. Plumlee was 1 of 7 from the line in the last 2:41 of the third when Philadelphia went ahead for good.  \u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable,\u201d Plumlee said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make free throws.\u201d  The run extended to 33-7 into the fourth thanks to Bayless, who hit a 3-pointer and two field goals to turn a three-point lead into a 91-80 advantage.  Murray said Philadelphia\u2019s defense wasn\u2019t the difference but the Nuggets\u2019 offense went cold.  \u201cGuys that normally make shots missed them today,\u201d he said.  Jokic made two free throws with 1:01 left to get Denver within 103-100 but Will Barton missed a tying 3-pointer with 25 seconds left.  Covington hit two free throws with 19.5 seconds left and iced it with a dunk.  NOTES: Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said the decision to sit C Joel Embiid on one end of back-to-back games is medical. \u201cIt\u2019s all pointed toward health,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhen you play a game and you have a chance to have a day or multiple days in between that can better allow him to play whatever game it\u2019ll play out to be, then that\u2019s the answer. It\u2019s really as simple as that.\u201d ... Denver G Malik Beasley (right elbow sprain) was dressed and available. F Juancho Hernangomez (illness) was inactive. ... The Nuggets continue their homestand Wednesday against Phoenix while Philadelphia wraps up its five-game road trip Sunday against the Suns."

The tremblor was recorded west of Athens at 6.02 am (0402 GMT) in the Corinthian Gulf, with assessments giving it a focal depth of 5 kilometers, the National Observatory of Athens said on its website.  \u201cIt felt like two earthquakes in a row!
