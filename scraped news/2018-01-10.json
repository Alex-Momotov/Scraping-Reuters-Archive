          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s producer prices rose at their slowest pace in 13 months in December, as the government\u2019s war against winter smog dented factory demand for raw materials in a sign the world\u2019s second largest economy has started to slow.  The producer price index (PPI) rose 4.9 percent in December from a year earlier, the slowest growth since November 2016, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday. That was slightly faster than the 4.8 percent in a Reuters poll of analyst but much weaker than the 5.8 percent pace seen in November.  The data also showed consumer inflation accelerating less than expected and remaining well within the central bank\u2019s comfort zone.  Analysts say the year-on-year slowdown in producer price inflation was due in part to a high base last year with price gains in raw materials falling from their peaks. It also supports the view that a softening in the economy has started in the last few months.  \u201cLooking ahead, we think that food prices aside, inflation will continue to drop back in the coming quarters as economic activity softens,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.  The data shows producer price increases slowing for the second month in a row in December, which follows a modest recovery in prices seen in the third quarter of last year.  A government crackdown on smog in the heavily industrialized northern provinces this year has hit demand for raw materials and continued curbs on the housing market have weighed on property investment.  While pollution curbs have had a disinflationary effect on producer prices, the resulting supply disruptions have in some segments added upward pressure to prices.  On a month-on-month basis, the PPI rose 0.8 percent in December, beating November\u2019s 0.5 percent increase, due to temporary disruptions caused by the pollution curbs.  The production restrictions at factories have triggered fears of supply shortages, giving a major boost to iron ore and steel futures prices and helping to offset tepid demand during winter months as construction activities slow.  \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see whether those price gains will be passed onto consumers in 2018,\u201d said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst with Bank of Communications.   Raw material prices rose 8.1 percent in December year-on-year, slowing from the 9.7 percent increase in November, data from the statistics bureau showed.  China\u2019s industrial firms reported seven-month low earnings for November as demand and producer price gains eased, adding more pressure on companies saddled with debt.  In December, consumer inflation accelerated less than expected to 1.8 percent from a year earlier versus 1.7 percent in November. The consumer price index (CPI) had been expected to edge up to 1.9 percent.  The food price index declined 0.4 percent in December after falling 1.1 percent in November. Non-food prices rose 2.4 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in November.  Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, slowed to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent a month earlier.  For 2017, CPI rose 1.6 percent, well within Beijing\u2019s annual target of 3 percent, while PPI surged 6.3 percent, ending a falling streak over the past five years.  \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that CPI this year will surpass the government\u2019s comfort zone of 3 percent. I expect the central bank will stay put, under no pressure of resorting to monetary policy to contain modest inflation,\u201d Bank of Communications\u2019 Liu said.  China\u2019s economy is expected to have posted growth of 6.8 percent in 2017, up slightly from the previous year, supported by a construction boom and robust exports.

          "body": "* AirAsia restructuring, pursuing asset monetisation strategy  * Indian stake could be worth $200 mln once profitable - analyst  * Completed Indonesia unit IPO, Philippines expected this year (Adds details of services business, analyst comment)  By Jamie Freed  SINGAPORE, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Malaysia-based AirAsia Bhd is considering an initial public offering for its Indian unit and seeking a partner for its services business, the carrier\u2019s group chief executive Tony Fernandes said on Wednesday.  This is the latest in a series of asset monetisations being undertaken by the budget airline group, which this week received shareholder nod for a reorganisation to make AirAsia Group Bhd the listed holding company for assets across Asia.  AirAsia has already completed a backdoor listing of Indonesia AirAsia TBK PT and finalised a S$119.3 million ($89.38 million) joint venture for its ground-handling business with Singapore\u2019s SATS Ltd. Its Philippine unit is looking to raise up to $250 million via an IPO in mid-2018.  AirAsia will seek approval at the next AirAsia India board meeting to pick a banker to start a preliminary process for an IPO, Fernandes posted on Twitter on Wednesday.  While analysts are \u201cgiving zero value to AirAsia India\u201d, the unit is a \u201cvery valuable asset with huge growth potential\u201d, he said in separate tweets, adding the subsidiary \u201cwas not far from 20 planes and a potential IPO\u201d.  According to Indian regulations, airlines need to have a fleet of at least 20 aircraft to fly on international routes.  AirAsia India, a joint venture with India\u2019s Tata Sons conglomerate, had 14 planes at end-2017. Its revenue last year was expected to double to 12 billion rupees ($188.44 million) and climb to 18 billion rupees in 2018.  The fast-growing Indian venture reported a net loss of 164 million rupees in the quarter ended September, according to AirAsia\u2019s latest accounts.  \u201cAirAsia India is still incurring start-up losses and in negative equity so it is challenging to ascribe much value to the business at this point,\u201d said Corrine Png, the CEO of transport research firm Crucial Perspective.  However, she said if the Indian venture grew its fleet to 20 and turned profitable, AirAsia\u2019s 49-percent stake could be worth $200 million based on listed Indian airline rivals.  Fernandes said AirAsia was also in the process of appointing a banker to find a partner for its shared services centre business, AirAsia Global Shared Services, which provides accounting services and data management for its airlines.  But Png said the value of that business would be insignificant, at around 1 million ringgit ($249,563.26).  AirAsia said it did not have any additional information to share on the plans announced by Fernandes.  The company\u2019s strategy involves selling more stakes in non-flying businesses to help fund special dividends, Fernandes said in October.

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - All 28 Chinese cities in a demanding winter anti-smog campaign met their air quality targets from October to December, but weather conditions could pose challenges in early 2018, the environment ministry said on Wednesday.  The 28 northern cities were ordered to cut concentrations of small, breathable particles known as PM2.5 by 10-25 percent during October 2017-March 2018. They have been curbing industrial output, thinning traffic and cracking down on coal use in a bid to limit smog build-ups.  The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) said that all the cities exceeded their targets in the final three months of 2017, with average concentrations across the region hitting 71 micrograms per cubic meter, down 34.3 percent from a year earlier.   But the ministry, citing meteorologists, said unfavorable weather, including relatively warm temperatures, is expected to make smog dispersal more difficult in January and February.      It said Shijiazhuang, one of China\u2019s most polluted cities and the capital of heavily industrial Hebei province, saw the biggest improvement in late 2017, with PM2.5 falling 54.8 percent on an annual basis for October-December, more than double its 25 percent target.

Arena.  Mustapha Heron finished with 15 points, and Anfernee McLemore added 13 points, nine rebounds and three blocks for the Tigers, who snapped a 10-game losing streak to Ole Miss. Bryce Brown also had 13 points for Auburn (15-1, 3-0 SEC).  Breein Tyree scored a season-high 24 points, and Terence Davis added 13 points for the Rebels, who were without leading-scorer Deandre Burnett. Burnett sat out the game due to flu-like symptoms.  Auburn opened the second half with an 18-7 run and took its first lead since early in the first half on a layup from Heron with 11:53 to play. Murray hit a pair of free throws to push the Tigers\u2019 edge to 68-57 with seven minutes to play.  Auburn maintained a comfortable lead the rest of the way, with McLemore throwing down an alley-oop dunk for the punctuation mark with 1:30 to play.  The Rebels (9-7, 2-2 SEC) led for the majority of the first half, behind 12 points from Tyree, and went into halftime with a 45-35 advantage. However, Ole Miss went cold in the second half and lost to Auburn for the first time since 2010.  Ole Miss\u2019 Bruce Stevens finished with 12 points before fouling out in the second half, and Dominik Olejniczak recorded a double-double off the bench with 10 points and 10 rebounds.  Jared Harper and Horace Spencer each finished with 12 points for the Tigers.  Auburn\u2019s 13-game winning streak is the second longest in the nation. The Tigers moved into the polls this week, the first time since 2003 that Auburn has been ranked.  Auburn now hits the road for consecutive away games, beginning Saturday at Mississippi State.

Johnny Gaudreau assisted all three goals, including Hamilton\u2019s winner, for a Flames team that recovered from blowing a two-goal third-period lead at the Xcel Energy Center.  The Flames (22-16-4) are receiving some big performances from the top line during their winning streak that\u2019s now spilled into the start of a four-game road trip.  First, Micheal Ferland, one of the league\u2019s break-out players this season, netted his career-high 18th goal of the season six minutes into the clash when he finished a perfectly executed three-on-two rush that featured his linemates.  Then, Sean Monahan lit the lamp in the final minute of the second period, finishing another pretty passing play that left him with essentially an open net behind Wild goalie Alex Stalock.  Monahan\u2019s tally marked his 20th of the season, a standard he\u2019s reached in all five seasons in his NHL career. The only other player in franchise history to achieve that feat is Joe Nieuwendyk.  But the Wild didn\u2019t roll over. Mikael Granlund began the comeback seven minutes into the third period by snapping home a top-corner shot past Flames goalie Mike Smith for his 12th goal of the season, and defenseman Jared Spurgeon forced overtime by blasting a sharp-angled rocket off the far post and into the net.  Smith finished the night with 33 saves in a brilliant performance for Calgary, which next plays Thursday at the Tampa Bay Lightning.  Stalock stopped 26 shots for the Wild (22-17-4), who were without forward Nino Niederreiter due to a lower-body injury the team said will keep him out of action at least a week.

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - All 28 Chinese cities in a demanding winter anti-smog campaign met their air quality targets from October to December, but weather conditions could pose challenges in early 2018, the environment ministry said on Wednesday.  The 28 northern cities were ordered to cut concentrations of small, breathable particles known as PM2.5 by 10-25 percent during October 2017-March 2018. They have been curbing industrial output, thinning traffic and cracking down on coal use in a bid to limit smog build-ups.  The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) said that all the cities exceeded their targets in the final three months of 2017, with average concentrations across the region hitting 71 micrograms per cubic meter, down 34.3 percent from a year earlier.   But the ministry, citing meteorologists, said unfavorable weather, including relatively warm temperatures, is expected to make smog dispersal more difficult in January and February.      It said Shijiazhuang, one of China\u2019s most polluted cities and the capital of heavily industrial Hebei province, saw the biggest improvement in late 2017, with PM2.5 falling 54.8 percent on an annual basis for October-December, more than double its 25 percent target.

          "body": "John Calipari isn\u2019t accustomed to losing consecutive games at Kentucky.  His young, inexperienced squad helped him narrowly avoid such a predicament on Tuesday.  No. 21 Kentucky rallied to avoid a second consecutive loss in Southeastern Conference play, defeating Texas A&M 74-73 at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Ky. The Wildcats improved to 41-8 in games following a loss in Calipari\u2019s nine seasons on campus.  Hamidou Diallo scored 14 of his 18 points in the second half for Kentucky (13-3, 3-1 SEC), which starts five freshmen and boasts no seniors on its roster.  The Wildcats were coming off an 11-point loss at No. 23 Tennessee on Saturday. A second straight defeat looked like a strong possibility with 8:44 to go in the game when Texas A&M (11-5, 0-4) took its largest lead of the contest, 59-53, on a D.J. Hogg layup.  However, layups by P.J. Washington, Diallo and Kevin Knox got Kentucky within 61-59 by the 6:04 mark. Knox, who went 5-for-5 from the floor and finished with 15 points, tied the score at 67 with a pair of free throws with 2:44 to play.  Knox followed with a layup after Washington stole the ball and found Knox downcourt to give the Wildcats a 69-67 lead they managed to hold for good.  However, the Aggies didn\u2019t relent, and Kentucky had to sweat out a pair of open 3-point tries late to hold on for the victory. Tyler Davis had 21 points, including 14 in the first half, and five rebounds for Texas A&M, which hasn\u2019t won since Dec. 21.  After trailing at the half, Texas A&M forged ahead early in the second half and grabbed a 44-39 lead at the 17:31 mark on a 3-pointer by Admon Gilder (14 points). However, Diallo scored five consecutive points to tie it at 44.  Washington and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander each scored 16 points for the Wildcats.  Kentucky, which next plays at Vanderbilt on Saturday, ensured another close contest against Texas A&M as it only made 22 of 34 free-throw attempts. The Wildcats and Aggies had gone to overtime in four of their previous seven meetings.  The Aggies shot 14 of 24 from the free-throw line.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Williams set a career high with 37 points, and Schofield tied a career high with 22 as the Volunteers won in Vanderbilt\u2019s gym for the second consecutive season.  Tennessee shot 25 of 28 from the foul line, while the Commodores were just 15 of 22 on free throws.  Vanderbilt was led in scoring by freshman guard Saben Lee (21 points), with help from forward Jeff Roberson (19) and guards Riley LaChance (16) and Matthew Fisher-Davis (10).  Tennessee started to pull away midway through the second half, and Williams added the dagger late. After Williams missed a layup, the Volunteers retained possession with 1:28 left after the ball hit a Vanderbilt defender on the way out of bounds.  Williams then rattled home a short shot in the paint with 1:00 left, putting Tennessee up 85-77.  The Volunteers trailed by 10 at half but hit eight of their first 10 shots after the break, taking a lead on a Williams layup with 12:39 left off a feed from guard James Daniel.  The Commodores\u2019 problem with Williams was more than the point total. The sophomore fouled out starting center D\u2019jery Baptiste with 5:59 left. Vanderbilt reserve Clevon Brown had four fouls with 8:55 left before fouling out later.  That also opened up the outside, where Tennessee got a number of good looks and was 6 of 8 on 3-point tries in the second half.  Williams had 17 first-half points on an array of mid-range jumpers and spin moves in the lane. Schofield added nine as the Vols led for most of the first half and went into the locker room up by 10.  Roberson led Vanderbilt with 10 first-half points, but it was Lee who provided the Commodores\u2019 two biggest first-half highlights. He drove the right baseline and hammered home a dunk to put Vanderbilt up 35-30, and moments later, he hit a contested 3-pointer from straight away to give Vandy its biggest lead to that point at seven.  That advantage became 45-35 at the break, when LaChance just beat the buzzer with a 3-pointer from the left side.  \u2014Field Level Media"

DeMar DeRozan put the Raptors ahead by tipping in his own miss with 3.1 seconds left before Ellington answered with the layup that gave Miami its fifth consecutive victory.  Ellington received an inbounds pass in the right corner and drove the baseline for the winning points as the Heat snapped a five-game losing streak in Toronto.  Goran Dragic scored 24 points and collected a career-best 12 rebounds for the Heat (23-17). Bam Adebayo recorded 16 points and career bests of 15 rebounds and five blocked shots, Ellington scored 15 points, and Hassan Whiteside contributed 13 points and 15 rebounds.  DeRozan scored 25 points for Toronto but shot just 10 of 29 as the Raptors (28-11) had their five-game winning streak halted. Delon Wright scored 13 points while starting in place of point guard Kyle Lowry, who is day-to-day due to a bruised tailbone and back spasms.  Lowry was injured during Toronto\u2019s Monday victory over the Brooklyn Nets when he fell hard to the floor after battling for a rebound. He landed on his lower back and buttocks, had to be carried off the court and left the arena in a wheelchair.  Toronto\u2019s Serge Ibaka and Miami\u2019s James Johnson were ejected for exchanging punches in the third quarter.  The Heat led 84-77 after Adebayo\u2019s basket with 4:31 to play before Toronto recovered and appeared to be in good shape after DeRozan\u2019s tip. However, a defensive breakdown allowed Ellington to get loose and score his only points of the second half.  Miami led by 12 early in the third quarter before the Raptors responded with 11 straight points. Dragic later scored the final six points of an 8-0 run to account for a nine-point edge, and Whiteside\u2019s dunk with 1:22 remaining in the third gave the Heat a 70-58 lead before Toronto pulled within 72-64 by the end of the quarter.  Dragic scored 14 first-half points and Ellington added 13 as Miami held a 51-41 halftime advantage. Dragic capped his strong half with a 13-footer with 19 seconds left to make it a 10-point margin.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "* Trader exodus in London, Singapore  * Vitol bought core of oil business based in Americas in Oct.  * Noble posted $3 billion net loss in first 9 months of 2017  By Julia Payne and Ahmad Ghaddar  LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Noble Group is closing down its London oil desk and winding down its Asia oil operations, sources familiar with the matter said, as heavy losses and high debt force what was once Asia\u2019s biggest commodities trader to restructure.  The closures follow the sale of its larger U.S. oil trading business to Vitol, announced in October, and a nine-month loss of some $3 billion reported in November.  Since then, Noble has been winding down its remaining oil trading operations in London and Singapore, with many key traders leaving to join competitors.  \u201cThat (U.S. oil business) comprised the material share of Noble\u2019s oil business. The rest ... has either closed or is in the final process of sale,\u201d a source familiar with the matter said.  A spokeswoman for Noble Group declined to comment.  The company, which had a market capitalisation of $6 billion in early February 2015, was plunged into crisis after a report by blogger Iceberg Research later that month questioning its accounting.  Noble stood by its accounts and rejected the report\u2019s allegations but coupled with a major commodities downturn, the firm was unable to recover investor confidence. Its market value has shrunk to around $215 million.  The closure of its London and Singapore desks marks an effective exit from the oil trading business. In 2016, the number of employees at NCFL (Noble Clean Fuels Ltd) in London was 25, down from 35 the year before.  The Singapore-listed company, founded in 1986 by Richard Elman, is returning to its roots as a hard commodities business in Asia, mainly involved in coal marketing, a business that is partly financed by Mercuria Group..  Traders said that they have not seen activity from the company in several months and its head of crude, Chris McAleese, left late last year.  He was hired about a year ago to rebuild the business during a brief upswing in the company\u2019s finances.  Noble\u2019s star gasoline trader in the United States, Dimitri Sinenko, was poached by Gunvor at the end of last year.  Two distillate traders recently moved from the London office to Unipec and a crude trader went to Trafigura.  From Noble\u2019s Singapore oil desk, a senior crude trader just moved to Statoil and Morten Buur-Jensen became Singapore managing director of Africa-focused oil trader Mocoh in November.  A source in Asia said that the firm was winding down some old contracts with only a handful of employees left.  In November, the company said that it would keep LNG and some Asia-focused distillates businesses, which complement its hard commodities.  In an effort to stay afloat, the firm has been forced to sell key parts of its global business across commodities but the company continued to post major losses and some asset sales have fetched less than expected.  An agreement to sell its North American gas and power business to competitor Mercuria Group concluded at $168 million, down from an original price of $250 million.  Paul Brough, a restructuring specialist who oversaw part of the liquidation of Lehman Brothers, was appointed chairman last year.  Brough said in December that he would take steps to avoid insolvency and was in the process of negotiating a debt restructuring programme.  Noble had bank debt of about $1.2 billion and bonds aggregating to about $2.3 billion as of mid-December. Noble has sought alternative financing.

Blues goalie Jake Allen (18 saves) was chased with 3:23 left in the second period, immediately following the fifth Panthers goal of the game, by Vincent Trocheck.  Allen has lost eight of his past nine starts, allowing 10 goals in his two most recent efforts, against the Philadelphia Flyers and Florida.  The Panthers, who rallied from an early 2-0 deficit, got three points each from Jonathan Huberdeau (one goal, two assists), Trocheck (two goals, one assist) and Aleksander Barkov (one goal, two assists).  Barkov\u2019s goal was the 87th of his career, tying David Booth for 10th place in Panthers history. Trocheck, meanwhile, got career assist No. 100.  Panthers goalie James Reimer, making his 15th straight start, earned the win, making 26 saves.  St. Louis opened the scoring, lighting the lamp just 48 seconds into the game. Paul Stastny spun away from a check by Florida defenseman Mark Pysyk, putting him in position to tap in a loose puck at the doorstep.  The Blues, using exquisite passing, scored again with 8:05 left in the first period. Brayden Schenn got the puck to Vladimir Tarasenko, whose cross-ice feed teed up Colton Parayko below the left circle.

The Panthers capped a wild first period, tying the score 2-2 on a lucky goal by Barkov, who had a pass from Huberdeau deflect in off his right skate. The play was set up by Evgenii Dadonov\u2019s impressive rush to the net.  St. Louis got back on track to start the second period as Tarasenko scored off a cross-ice pass from Ivan Barbashev.  But the Panthers dominated the rest of the second period, starting with Radim Vrbata\u2019s top-shelf rebound goal that tied the score 3-3 with 12:23 expired in the second period.  Florida took a 4-3 lead when Barkov won a face-off, and Huberdeau pounced, scoring after some nifty stickhandling.  Trocheck completed the barrage, darting forward toward empty ice in the slot, taking Mike Matheson\u2019s lead pass and beating a beleaguered Allen.  Florida\u2019s Colton Sceviour added a third-period goal. St. Louis countered with a Tage Thompson goal with 2:41 left, but the Panthers held on and are now 11-0 this season when leading going into the third period.

          "body": "SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A Latin American human rights court said on Tuesday that countries in the region should legalize same-sex unions, endorsing a growing push for marriage equality despite opposition from the Roman Catholic Church.   The Inter-American Court of Human Rights\u2019 decision came in response to a petition submitted two years ago by Costa Rican president Luis Guillermo Solis, who had vowed to increase rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the majority Catholic country.    A number of Latin American countries, including Costa Rica, do not allow same-sex marriage. However, that trend is changing and in recent years same-sex couples have been allowed to marry in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and some parts of Mexico, despite church opposition.   The Inter-American Court, based in Costa Rica\u2019s capital San Jose, said the countries that it oversees should treat same-sex couples \u201cwithout discrimination,\u201d ensuring that they receive the same family and financial rights as heterosexual couples.  It also recommended that these rights be ensured through temporary decrees while governments pursue permanent laws.  Costa Rica\u2019s government celebrated the decision, saying that lawmakers would take steps to adopt the court\u2019s criteria \u201cin its totality.\u201d  \u201cThe court ... reminds all states on the continent, including ours, of their obligation and historical debt toward this population,\u201d Costa Rica\u2019s vice president Ana Helena Chacon said at a press conference.

          "body": "TOKYO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance said it is setting up a venture capital fund that plans to invest as much as $1 billion over five years, the latest move by major carmakers as they seek to adapt to rapid industry change by investing in startups.  It is set to be largest corporate venture capital fund in the auto industry over the period until 2022, the companies said in a statement.  The traditional auto industry model based on individual ownership is threatened by pay-per-use services such as Uber, as well as ride- and car-sharing platforms, a challenge heightened by shifts towards electric and self-driving cars.  The fund expects to invest up to $200 million in its first year and key potential areas of investment include vehicle electrification, autonomous systems and artificial intelligence, the statement said.  It will be 40 percent financed by Renault SA, 40 percent by Nissan Motor Co Ltd and 20 percent by Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  The plan, reported by Reuters last week, calls for the firms to establish the fund as a Dutch-registered joint venture headed by Francois Dossa, a former banker who led Brazil operations for Societe Generale and then for Nissan, sources familiar with the matter said.  The first deal by the fund, called Alliance Ventures, will be a strategic investment in Ionic Materials, a U.S.-based firm that is developing solid-state cobalt-free battery materials.  The $200 million initial venture capital investment comes in addition to more than 8.5 billion euros ($10.2 billion) in combined annual research and development investments by the three automakers.  $1 = 0.8370 euros\nReporting by Minami Funakoshi; Editing by Edwina Gibbs"

It marked just the second time all season that the 39-year-old Nowitzki reached the 20-point mark. Dennis Smith Jr. also scored 20 points for the Mavericks, who ended a three-game slide while notching their sixth consecutive home victory over the Magic.  Wesley Matthews scored 16 points for Dallas and Harrison Barnes and Yogi Ferrell each added 15.  Aaron Gordon scored 19 points and D.J.

The rest of the Golden Eagles, especially Rowsey, who made 10 of 18 shots and four 3-pointers, made up for it as Marquette beat a ranked foe for the first time in five tries this season.  Sam Hauser finished with 14 points for the Golden Eagles (12-5, 3-2 Big East).  Ismael Sanogo scored 14 points, Angel Delgado had 12 and Desi Rodriguez added 11 for the Pirates (14-3, 3-1).  Rowsey scored Marquette\u2019s first 11 points while his teammates combined to go 0-for-8 from the floor. Howard knocked down a jumper with 11:50 to play in the half as the Golden Eagles used an 11-0 run to take a 15-9 lead.  Rodriguez finally snapped the Pirates\u2019 drought when Carrington fed him for a dunk with 10:26 left. Seton Hall got within a bucket after Carrington\u2019s jumper with 8:30 left, but the Golden Eagles used an 8-0 run to go up 25-15.

The scoring total was also a career-high for Newman, whose best previously was 25 points while playing for Mississippi State.  Newman converted a block into a fast-break layup with 2:30 remaining as part of 9-0 run by the Jayhawks to snap a 73-73 tie. Devonte Graham added two buckets during that spurt, which Svi Mykhailiuk capped with a three-point play at the :55 mark.

Still, seven ties were forged as the game was a toss-up inside the final media time out.

Foster announced his presence with authority right away, drilling a 3-pointer 24 seconds into the game to mark Creighton\u2019s 800th consecutive game with at least one 3. Butler got the game even just once at 7-7, but the Bluejays responded with a 3-pointer from Hegner and never looked back.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s administration will not allow drilling for oil and gas off the coast of Florida after urging from the state\u2019s governor, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Tuesday.  \u201cI support the governor\u2019s position that Florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver,\u201d Zinke said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cAs a result of discussion with Governor (Rick) Scott and his leadership, I am removing Florida from consideration for any new oil and gas platforms.\u201d  The Trump administration last week proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, a move aimed at boosting domestic energy production and which sparked protests from coastal states, environmentalists and the tourism industry.  The administration\u2019s decision on Tuesday removes from consideration a portion of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, an area that oil drillers have said they are interested in exploring \u2013 but not all of it.  Florida state waters extend 3 nautical miles from the shore on the Atlantic, and 9 nautical miles on the Gulf side, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.  Scott last week announced his opposition to the drilling plan and said he had asked to meet with Zinke.  Zinke\u2019s decision to exempt Florida from offshore drilling  leaves the door open for other governors opposed to offshore oil and gas development to seek a similar prohibition for their states.  Oceana, an environmental lobby group, said it was pleased that Zinke had removed Florida from areas open to drilling.  \u201cSuch a quick reversal begs the question: Will the Trump administration give equal consideration to all the other coastal Governors from both parties who overwhelmingly reject this radical offshore drilling plan?\u201d Oceana campaign director Diane Hoskins said in a statement.   On Twitter, several governors, attorneys general and lawmakers representing coastal states asked Zinke to extend the exemption for Florida to their coastal waters.  The governors of New York and Oregon and the attorneys general of Maryland and California were among those who called on Zinke to ban offshore drilling.  Environmental groups Greenpeace and the League of Conservation Voters called the move to protect Florida a political ploy meant to bolster the governor who is reportedly planning to run for an open U.S. Senate seat.  \u201cPresident Trump has directed me to rebuild our offshore oil and gas program in a manner that supports our national energy policy and also takes into consideration the local and state voice,\u201d Zinke said in Tuesday\u2019s statement.  Zinke said last week that the department\u2019s draft National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2019 to 2024 would make over 90 percent of the outer continental shelf\u2019s total acreage available for leasing to drillers, a national record.  That would reverse the Obama administration order placing 94 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers. Obama\u2019s 2017-2022 plan would be replaced by the new program when it is finalized.  The effort to open previously off-limits acreage in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans comes less than eight years after BP Plc\u2019s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico - the largest in American history. The disaster caused billions of dollars in economic damage and led the Obama administration to increase regulation of the industry.  The Defense Department has also raised concerns about opening drilling that had been banned off the eastern Gulf of Mexico, where military exercises are held.

          "body": "Jake Dotchin netted his third goal of the season with just over 10 minutes left in regulation to break a deadlock and Tyler Johnson\u2019s hat-trick tally minutes later served as the game winner as the Tampa Bay Lightning claimed a 5-4 win over the Carolina Hurricanes Tuesday in Tampa.  The Lightning needed both goals to close out the see-saw affair at Amalie Arena, as the visitors nearly completed a comeback in the dying minutes.  Johnson\u2019s difference-making marker, a prime example of both his speed and determination, marks the first three-goal game of the season for a Tampa player, even though the high-flying Lightning sit atop the league standings and boast the NHL\u2019s most potent attack.  Carolina\u2019s Brock McGinn opened the scoring with an early power-play goal, finishing off a tap-in goal while left alone at the doorstep, but it didn\u2019t take long to see it would be a wild game.  Victor Hedman evened the score at the midway point of the opening frame, beating Hurricanes goalie Cam Ward with a long wrister off the rush, but Sebastian Aho restored the Carolina lead when he took advantage of a turnover to corral a loose puck and sling a shot past Tampa netminder Andrei Vasilevskiy.  Johnson then joined the fun, first by tying the contest before the first intermission by deflecting a point shot, and then scoring quickly after the break by batting home a second rebound chance while he was falling down to give the hosts a 3-2 edge.  Again, though, a lead couldn\u2019t be held. This time it was Carolina answering the challenge when Justin Faulk netted his team\u2019s second man-advantage marker just past the midway point.  Faulk also scored late to make it a one-goal game, but it was too little, too late for the Hurricanes (19-15-8), who received a 29-save performance from Ward.  Tampa\u2019s Braydon Point collected three assists and Vasilevskiy stopped 28 shots for the Lightning (31-9-3).  The Lightning play host to the Calgary Flames on Thursday. The Hurricanes face the Washington Capitals to start a home-and-home series that same night.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "With a bit of help from video review, Pekka Rinne and the Nashville Predators continued two streaks of dominance Tuesday night.  Rinne stopped 25 shots as Nashville edged visiting Edmonton 2-1 in Bridgestone Arena for its 11th consecutive win against the Oilers and Rinne\u2019s 10th straight victory against them, dating back to March 18, 2014.  The Predators (25-11-6) won their second straight game before going into a five-day break. Edmonton (18-23-3) absorbed its seventh defeat in eight games and has managed just four goals in its past six games.  The latest defeat might have been the most frustrating for the Oilers, who appeared to tie the game at 14:56 of the third period when Mark Letestu knocked a rebound past Rinne.  However, Nashville coach Peter Laviolette challenged the goal on the basis of offside. Replay revealed that Jujhar Khaira had a skate in the zone and another one in the air before the puck entered the offensive zone, and the goal was erased.  Edmonton pulled Talbot with two minutes left for a sixth skater, but Rinne (21-8-3) came up with his last three saves, including one on Connor McDavid\u2019s wrister with 1:19 left.  Nashville controlled the first period, establishing a 2-0 lead. The first marker came just eight seconds into a power play that began when Milan Lucic was called for interference against Kyle Turris.  Off a clean faceoff win, the Predators moved the puck quickly before finding P.K. Subban for a point blast. Cam Talbot made the save, but Craig Smith pounced on the rebound and poked home his 15th goal of the season at 8:26.  Nashville potted the eventual game-winner with some puck luck. Roman Josi ripped a slapper from the left point that caromed off Talbot, then stuck Oilers defenseman Adam Larsson in the face and plopped down at the goalmouth. Viktor Arvidsson collected the rebound and scored his 13th goal at 15:31.  McDavid scored on a wrister through Rinne\u2019s pads at 45 seconds of the second period, his 15th goal of the season, but that was all the Oilers could muster.  Talbot (15-16-2) made 22 saves.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. aluminum products makers sought new trade protections against Chinese imports on Tuesday, accusing China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd and its affiliates of evading U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by shipping aluminum products through Vietnam.  In a filing with the U.S. Commerce Department, the Aluminum Extruders Council said that aluminum extrusions from Zhongwang were being shipped to affiliate Global Vietnam Aluminum Co Ltd for conversion work before being exported to the United States.  Duties on Chinese extrusions are currently a combined 106 percent, according to the Commerce Department.    In response, Zhongwang told Reuters that the \u201callegations made are without grounds\u201d.  The anti-circumvention petition follows a number of U.S. actions to raise barriers to Chinese aluminum, including Commerce Department preliminary duties on Chinese aluminum foil and a rare U.S. government-initiated investigation into imports of Chinese aluminum alloy sheet products.   It also comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is considering much broader global restrictions on aluminum imports on national security grounds.   The Commerce Department is due to issue recommendations to Trump from its \u201cSection 232\u201d investigation into aluminum imports on Jan 22. Recommendations from a similar probe into steel imports are due on Jan. 16, but it is not clear whether either report will immediately be made public.  China\u2019s excess production capacity of both metals has emerged as a major trade irritant for the United States and Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports.   In the Vietnam petition, the Aluminum Extruders Council said it provided evidence that Zhongwang\u2019s affiliate in Vietnam was changing the shape and form of Chinese extrusions in minor ways but claiming their origin as Vietnamese.  \u201cThese blatant attempts to evade duties and flood the market with unfairly traded Chinese aluminum extrusions must be halted,\u201d the trade group\u2019s president, Jeff Henderson, said in a statement.  In June, the Commerce Department ordered that fabricated aluminum pallets imported from China should be subject to the U.S. duties after determining that they were part of a duty evasion scheme. The Aluminum Extruders Council argued that these products are being shipped through Vietnam with minor changes.  The Commerce Department has shown receptiveness to similar anti-circumvention cases in the steel sector. In December, the agency slapped steep duties on steel products from Vietnam that originated as Chinese made hot-rolled steel.

The win for Virginia (15-1, 4-0) broke a two-game losing streak to the Orange, and extended their home winning streak over Syracuse (12-5, 1-3) to three games.  Syracuse hung around the entire night in their upset bid and scored the first five points of the second half to take a two-point lead.

Syracuse also shot 38 percent as their scoring woes continued. Guard Frank Howard led the Orange with 18 points while freshman Oshae Brissett added 16.  The Orange outrebounded Virginia 41-31 including 19 offensive rebounds, but got just 17 second-chance points.  Syracuse started hot from beyond the arc as Howard knocked in three triples in the first half. After the Orange led for the first handful of minutes, Virginia heated up thanks to Hunter.  The Cavaliers led by as many as five in the half as Hunter scored 13 first-half points off of the bench. Virginia shot 41 percent for the half and led 32-29 after 20 minutes of play.

Peltz criticized how U.S. investors are required to elect boards, worrying about conflicts of interest at proxy advisory firms and how some big shareholders vote. \u201cThe proxy plumbing is busted,\u201d he said.  Turning to Trump, Peltz praised him for tax reform. \u201cI\u2019m a results-oriented guy and I\u2019m happy with what he\u2019s done.

          "title": "Bayer, J&J win reversal of $28 million verdict in Xarelto lawsuit",
          "body": "(Reuters) - A Pennsylvania state court judge on Tuesday overturned a $27.8 million jury award to an Indiana couple who accused Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson of failing to warn of internal bleeding risks of their drug Xarelto, the companies said.  Judge Michael Erdos, in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, ruled following a hearing on the drugmakers\u2019 motion to reverse the December verdict, which was their first trial loss in litigation over the blood thinner, the companies said.  J&J\u2019s Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc unit and Bayer, which jointly developed Xarelto, in separate statements welcomed the decision and said they will continue to defend against the allegations in related litigation.  \u201cBayer stands behind the safety and efficacy of Xarelto and will continue to vigorously defend it,\u201d Bayer said in a statement.  The verdict came in a lawsuit by Lynn Hartman, who was prescribed Xarelto to prevent strokes as a result of atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat.  Hartman said that she took the drug for approximately one year and in June 2014 was hospitalized with severe gastrointestinal bleeding, which she blamed on Xarelto. She has since recovered.  Hartman and her husband sued the drugmakers in 2015. A jury in December awarded $1.8 million in compensatory damages and $26 million in punitive damages.  The lawsuit was one of around 21,400 that J&J says are pending in federal and state courts blaming injuries on Xarelto. The trial was the first to result from roughly 1,400 Xarelto cases pending in the Philadelphia court.   Michael Weinkowitz, a lawyer for the couple, said the decision related to a \u201cvery narrow issue related to Mrs. Hartman\u2019s prescribing physician.\u201d He said he looked forward to trying the next series of Xarelto-related cases in Philadelphia.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Xarelto in 2011. It is prescribed for people with atrial fibrillation, a common heart rhythm disorder, and to treat and reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms.   But plaintiffs contend Xarelto was unreasonably dangerous and that J&J and Bayer failed to warn patients about a serious risk of uncontrollable, irreversible bleeding in emergencies.  Bayer and J&J contend Xarelto\u2019s label adequately warns of bleeding risks.  Federal juries have cleared the companies of liability in three previous trials. The latest verdict in the federal litigation came in August in the case of a Mississippi woman.  Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Leslie Adler"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. aluminum products makers sought new trade protections against Chinese imports on Tuesday, accusing China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd and its affiliates of evading U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by shipping aluminum products through Vietnam.  In a filing with the U.S. Commerce Department, the Aluminum Extruders Council said that aluminum extrusions from Zhongwang were being shipped to affiliate Global Vietnam Aluminum Co Ltd for conversion work before being exported to the United States.  Duties on Chinese extrusions are currently a combined 106 percent, according to the Commerce Department.    In response, Zhongwang told Reuters that the \u201callegations made are without grounds\u201d.  The anti-circumvention petition follows a number of U.S. actions to raise barriers to Chinese aluminum, including Commerce Department preliminary duties on Chinese aluminum foil and a rare U.S. government-initiated investigation into imports of Chinese aluminum alloy sheet products.   It also comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is considering much broader global restrictions on aluminum imports on national security grounds.   The Commerce Department is due to issue recommendations to Trump from its \u201cSection 232\u201d investigation into aluminum imports on Jan 22. Recommendations from a similar probe into steel imports are due on Jan. 16, but it is not clear whether either report will immediately be made public.  China\u2019s excess production capacity of both metals has emerged as a major trade irritant for the United States and Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports.   In the Vietnam petition, the Aluminum Extruders Council said it provided evidence that Zhongwang\u2019s affiliate in Vietnam was changing the shape and form of Chinese extrusions in minor ways but claiming their origin as Vietnamese.  \u201cThese blatant attempts to evade duties and flood the market with unfairly traded Chinese aluminum extrusions must be halted,\u201d the trade group\u2019s president, Jeff Henderson, said in a statement.  In June, the Commerce Department ordered that fabricated aluminum pallets imported from China should be subject to the U.S. duties after determining that they were part of a duty evasion scheme. The Aluminum Extruders Council argued that these products are being shipped through Vietnam with minor changes.  The Commerce Department has shown receptiveness to similar anti-circumvention cases in the steel sector. In December, the agency slapped steep duties on steel products from Vietnam that originated as Chinese made hot-rolled steel.

Maye, a junior forward, shot 13-for-20 from the field, including 4-for-5 on 3-point attempts. He became the first North Carolina player to reach the 30-point mark at the Smith Center in six years.  Maye, who also had 18 rebounds, had reached a double-double in the first half to break out of a recent slump.  Cameron Johnson added 14 points and 11 rebounds, Joel Berry II had 13 points and Kenny Williams supplied 10 points for the Tar Heels (13-4, 2-2 Atlantic Coast Conference).  Ky Bowman scored 21 points for Boston College (11-6, 2-3), which has lost its last 11 meetings with the Tar Heels.  Jerome Robinson\u2019s 15 points along with 11 points apiece from Steffon Mitchell and Jordan Chatman were enough to keep the Eagles in this one.  North Carolina had been saddled with back-to-back losses for the first time since February 2016. The Tar Heels avoided their first three-game slide since January 2014.  North Carolina used Johnson, a redshirt junior transfer, in the starting lineup for the first time. Johnson, a guard, got into the act right away with a put-back dunk.  The lineup change eliminated a true post player from the starting group. Johnson, a former Pittsburgh player, is known as a perimeter threat, but he was 0-for-3 on 3-point launches.  The Tar Heels shot 50 percent from the field and finished with a 58-23 rebounding advantage.  Boston College was charged with only five turnovers, but its 38.7 percent shooting from the field became a problem.  North Carolina built a 50-35 halftime lead. That first-half total eclipsed the Tar Heels\u2019 full-game output from a 61-49 loss at Virginia on Saturday.  North Carolina grabbed 20 of the game\u2019s first 24 rebounds. The board work aided a first-half run that resulted in a 37-23 lead in barely more than 15 minutes of play.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Donatella is artistic director and vice president of the privately held fashion company.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if she (Donatella) is going to watch the show, but if she did I think that she would see that we treat her and her family with respect and kindness,\u201d Murphy told Variety on Tuesday night.  \u201cShe really is a feminist role model in my book, because she had to step into an impossible situation, which she did with grace and understanding. I think that she really loves Penelope and knows that Penelope would never do anything to represent her in a negative light,\u201d Murphy said.  Screenwriter Tom Rob Smith said the series aimed to be truthful in its spirit, even if it gets some details wrong.  \u201cThe show is full of love for him (Versace),\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are points where (the family) could correct some of the smaller details, but I think the bigger picture is that this is a figure that we\u2019re celebrating and a figure that we all fell in love with.\u201d  Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Lisa Shumaker"

The Capitals (27-13-3) have also won 10 consecutive home games, the longest streak in the NHL this season.  Vancouver (16-21-6) is trending the opposite way, having dropped its fifth consecutive game. The Canucks have won just twice in their past 15 matchups.  Capitals goalie Philipp Grubauer started for the first time since Dec. 27. He finished with 37 saves as Washington avenged a 6-2 loss to Vancouver on Oct. 26.  Washington winger Devante Smith-Pelly and Vancouver\u2019s Ben Hutton traded punches in the third period. Smith-Pelly didn\u2019t like a hard hit Hutton put Brooks Orpik.  Vancouver forward Sven Baertschi (eight goals, 10 assists) was able to play for the second straight time after missing 11 games because of a broken jaw.  Smith-Pelly was called for hooking with 12:55 left in the first period. Less than a minute later, the Capitals were penalized again for too many players on the ice that set up a 5-on-3 for Vancouver. The Canucks took advantage when Daniel Sedin deflected a shot by Alexander Edler into the bottom of the goal.  Washington tied the game on a close-range shot by Carlson with 4:47 left.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An associate of Donald Trump expressed concerns to the FBI about contacts between Russia and Trump\u2019s presidential election campaign team, helping to trigger the probe into possible collusion, according to closed-door testimony made public on Tuesday by a senior Democrat.  Glenn Simpson, who leads the Washington research firm Fusion GPS, said in his August testimony that the Federal Bureau of Investigation received intelligence from a \u201cvoluntary source\u201d in Trump\u2019s orbit in 2016, before a former British spy gave the FBI his own \u201cdossier\u201d of allegations about collusion.  Fusion GPS hired the former spy, Christopher Steele, to investigate Trump\u2019s business dealings with Russia.  Some Republicans critical of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials have claimed the initial FBI probe was triggered by Steele\u2019s dossier.  They have raised questions about whether the FBI may have relied on the Steele document to improperly obtain surveillance warrants to spy on Trump\u2019s campaign associates.   Simpson\u2019s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in August contradicted those claims.  \u201cThey had other intelligence about this matter from an internal Trump campaign source and ... they believed Chris\u2019 information might be credible,\u201d Simpson testified. \u201cI think it was a voluntary source, someone who was concerned about the same concerns we had.\u201d  Simpson later said he was not sure if the FBI informant was from the Trump election campaign or the Trump Organization, the president\u2019s real estate firm, which is now run by his two older sons.  Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate committee, released the testimony without Republican approval, in an apparent bid to neutralize Republican criticism of the Russia investigation.  Steele\u2019s dossier contains a number of inflammatory and salacious allegations about Trump and his alleged connections to Russia. Trump has slammed the dossier as \u201cbogus\u201d and denies his campaign colluded with Russia.  On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen filed two defamation lawsuits, one in New York state court against the popular website BuzzFeed News, which published the Fusion GPS dossier last year, and the second in federal court against Fusion GPS itself, ABC News reported.  Both lawsuits say the dossier compiled by Fusion GPS and contained \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d allegations about Cohen that resulted in \u201charm to his personal and professional reputation, current business interests, and the impairment of business opportunities,\u201d according to ABC News.  Cohen is mentioned in the dossier as having suspicious ties to Russian figures. Those allegations have not been verified.  BuzzFeed responded with a Twitter post that said the dossier continues to be the subject of investigations by Congress and intelligence agencies, was shown to two U.S. presidents and described in detail by news outlets worldwide.  \u201cIts interest to the public is obvious. This is not the first time Trump\u2019s lawyer has attacked the free press, and we look forward to defending our First Amendment rights in court,\u201d BuzzFeed said.  The lawsuits were not immediately available on online court websites.           Trump and some Republicans have attacked both Simpson\u2019s firm and Steele in recent months and also questioned the impartiality of the FBI and the Justice Department in an apparent effort to discredit Mueller\u2019s probe.  Mueller\u2019s team has produced two indictments and two guilty pleas by former Trump campaign aides.  Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Charles Grassley, had declined to release Simpson\u2019s testimony, saying he had refused to testify at a public hearing and failed to answer questions or turn over records.  Grassley\u2019s office slammed Feinstein for releasing the testimony, saying it came as the panel was still trying to interview other witnesses, including Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.   \u201cHer action undermines the integrity of the committee\u2019s oversight work and jeopardizes its ability to secure candid voluntary testimony,\u201d said Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy.     Democrats accused Republicans of withholding Simpson\u2019s  testimony in order to spread false information about his firm\u2019s role and undermine the Russia probe.  \u201cThe innuendo and misinformation circulating about the transcript are part of a deeply troubling effort to undermine the investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement. \u201cThe only way to set the record straight is to make the transcript public.\u201d  Also on Tuesday, a group of House of Representatives Democrats wrote to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan asking his party to \u201cfully investigate\u201d possible Russian interference in U.S. elections.   \u201cWe ask you to change course and begin demonstrating true leadership on this national security issue,\u201d said the letter,  released a year after U.S. intelligence agencies reported their findings that Russia had sought to intervene in the 2016 election on Trump\u2019s behalf.  Ryan aides did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ryan has previously expressed support for Mueller\u2019s investigation and a separate House probe.  Russia denies meddling in the U.S. presidential election.  Reporting by Sarah N.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia had its third-hottest year on record in 2017, the country\u2019s weather bureau said on Wednesday, as global warming changed the continent\u2019s climate and farmers warned unpredictable seasons are hurting the $47 billion agricultural sector.  Unusually, the high heat last year came despite the absence of an El Nino weather system in the Pacific, which tends to warm Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology said in its annual climate statement.  \u201cI think what it illustrates is even without the strong driver of an El Nino, the world is still producing very warm temperatures,\u201d Blair Trewin, a senior climatologist at the bureau told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.  During 2017 hotter ocean temperatures near Australia\u2019s northeast coast prompted \u201csignificant\u201d coral bleaching along the world-heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, the first time it had occurred in consecutive summers.  The national mean temperature was nearly one degree Celsius above average, with the heat \u201cmostly associated\u201d with human-caused global warming that also reduced rainfall in Australia\u2019s south, the bureau\u2019s statement said.  That made for the driest September ever recorded in crucial grain-growing regions of New South Wales and the Murray-Darling riverbasin, with heavy rains then hitting during harvest and making it even more difficult for farmers.   The world\u2019s fourth largest wheat exporter is set for its smallest crop in a decade.  \u201cIt\u2019s really the unpredictability of it rather than the actual event,\u201d said Matt Dalgleish, a market analyst at agricultural advisory firm Mecardo.  \u201cFarmers are used to dealing with different weather as long as it can run within a reasonably predictable pattern and sit reasonably close to the seasons they expect - it\u2019s when you get these events that are uncharacteristically out of season that cause the most amount of heartache.\u201d  Seven of Australia\u2019s 10 warmest years have occurred since 2005, the bureau found, and another hotter-than-average year is expected in 2018, which has already brought heatwave conditions to the country\u2019s southeast.  Sydney on Sunday sweltered through its hottest day in 80 years, while highway bitumen melted in Victoria state and bushfires burned out of control. In the northwest, a tropical storm is gathering and forecast to make landfall at cyclone-strength between Broome and Port Hedland on Saturday.  Globally it is likely 2017 will be the second- or third-warmest year on record since 1850, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said.  Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Michael Perry"

Dustin Byfuglien and Joel Armia also scored for the Jets.  Blake Wheeler, Jacob Trouba and Mathieu Perrault each had two assists in the victory.  Jets goalie Steve Mason lost his previous three starts, and this was his first start since Dec. 23. He finished with 30 saves and improved to 3-6-1 on the season.  Connor\u2019s second goal, at 7:08 of the third period, stretched the lead to 6-2. He took a quick diagonal pass from Trouba after a failed Buffalo clearance and scored from in front.  The Sabres didn\u2019t quit though, scoring two straight and cutting the deficit to 6-4 on Jack Eichel\u2019s second goal of the game with 5:07 left.  Armia sealed the Winnipeg victory on a late empty-net goal.  Lehner allowed three goals and was pulled after Ehlers scored 1:26 into the second period. Lehner made 14 saves. Chad Johnson replaced him and played until being pulled for an extra man late. He gave up three goals on 19 shots.  The Sabres (10-24-9) dropped their fifth in a row. They have won just twice in their past 12 games.  Eichel topped Buffalo with two goals and one assist while Ryan O\u2019Reilly added one goal and two assists. Jason Pominville scored the Sabres\u2019 other goal, and Kyle Okposo handed out three assists.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - A three-judge federal panel ordered congressional districts in North Carolina to be redrawn ahead of the 2018 elections, ruling on Tuesday that the Republican-drawn map was illegal and unconstitutionally partisan.  The ruling was the first time that a federal court blocked a congressional map because of partisan gerrymandering, said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice.  The judges in a 191-page ruling said the state legislator responsible for the 2016 map had said he drew it to give Republican candidates an advantage.   \u201cBut that is not a choice the Constitution allows legislative map drawers to make,\u201d the court said.  The panel gave the state until Jan. 29 to file a proposed remedial plan with the court. Congressional elections are scheduled for November across the United States.  Ralph Hise, North Carolina\u2019s state Senate Redistricting Chairman, said through a spokeswoman that lawmakers would appeal.  Dallas Woodhouse, the state\u2019s Republican Party Executive Director, said in a statement that the ruling usurped legislative authority and amounted to \u201cpartisan war on North Carolina Republican voters.\u201d  Democrats and the groups that brought the lawsuit applauded.  \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a major victory for North Carolina and people across the state whose voices were silenced by Republicans\u2019 unconstitutional attempts to rig the system to their partisan advantage,\u201d North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin said in a statement.  NYU\u2019s Li said that if the North Carolina case is upheld upon appeal it would have far-reaching implications.  \u201cThe courts will have signaled that there are, in fact, limits of how far you can go with partisan gerrymandering,\u201d Li said.    The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule later this year on Wisconsin\u2019s appeal of a lower court ruling that state Republican lawmakers created unconstitutional state legislative districts with the partisan aim of hobbling Democrats in legislative races.  The Supreme Court has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination, as it did last May when it found that Republican legislators in North Carolina had drawn two electoral districts to diminish the statewide political clout of black voters. But the justices have not thrown out state electoral maps drawn simply to give one party an advantage over another.  Republicans in North Carolina could decide to seek a stay of the ruling until the Supreme Court decides the Wisconsin case, said Virginia Tech political scientist Nicholas Goedert.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia had its third-hottest year on record in 2017, the country\u2019s weather bureau said on Wednesday, as global warming changed the continent\u2019s climate and farmers warned unpredictable seasons are hurting the $47 billion agricultural sector.  Unusually, the high heat last year came despite the absence of an El Nino weather system in the Pacific, which tends to warm Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology said in its annual climate statement.  \u201cI think what it illustrates is even without the strong driver of an El Nino, the world is still producing very warm temperatures,\u201d Blair Trewin, a senior climatologist at the bureau told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.  During 2017 hotter ocean temperatures near Australia\u2019s northeast coast prompted \u201csignificant\u201d coral bleaching along the world-heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, the first time it had occurred in consecutive summers.  The national mean temperature was nearly one degree Celsius above average, with the heat \u201cmostly associated\u201d with human-caused global warming that also reduced rainfall in Australia\u2019s south, the bureau\u2019s statement said.  That made for the driest September ever recorded in crucial grain-growing regions of New South Wales and the Murray-Darling riverbasin, with heavy rains then hitting during harvest and making it even more difficult for farmers.   The world\u2019s fourth largest wheat exporter is set for its smallest crop in a decade.  \u201cIt\u2019s really the unpredictability of it rather than the actual event,\u201d said Matt Dalgleish, a market analyst at agricultural advisory firm Mecardo.  \u201cFarmers are used to dealing with different weather as long as it can run within a reasonably predictable pattern and sit reasonably close to the seasons they expect - it\u2019s when you get these events that are uncharacteristically out of season that cause the most amount of heartache.\u201d  Seven of Australia\u2019s 10 warmest years have occurred since 2005, the bureau found, and another hotter-than-average year is expected in 2018, which has already brought heatwave conditions to the country\u2019s southeast.  Sydney on Sunday sweltered through its hottest day in 80 years, while highway bitumen melted in Victoria state and bushfires burned out of control. In the northwest, a tropical storm is gathering and forecast to make landfall at cyclone-strength between Broome and Port Hedland on Saturday.  Globally it is likely 2017 will be the second- or third-warmest year on record since 1850, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said.  Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Michael Perry"

Young finished with 27 points, nine assists, and four steals, as Oklahoma (13-2, 3-1 Big 12) bounced back from a loss at West Virginia on Saturday.  Keenan Evans led Texas Tech (14-2, 3-1) with 19 points on 7-of-17 shooting.  Oklahoma trailed for much of the first half but reeled off a 20-6 run to start the second half and take control.  Young scored 14 of Oklahoma\u2019s points during that stretch.  The Sooners missed their first 11 3-pointers before Christian James hit one in the final seconds of the first half.  Oklahoma hit six in the second half \u2014 four by Young.  It was Young\u2019s first game against his father\u2019s alma mater.

Lamont West and Daxter Miles had 12 points each on a low-scoring night for the Mountaineers (15-1, 4-0), who shot 31 percent yet extended the nation\u2019s longest active win streak to 15 games.  Manu Lecomte scored 13 to lead Baylor (11-5, 1-3) but the point guard missed the front end of a late one-and-one and twice missed potential game-tying 3s in the final 27 seconds. One of those misses came at the buzzer, set up by a court-length pass after Carter made two free throws with 4 seconds left.  Carter finished with only eight points on 2-of-7 shooting but made five assists and three steals.  Along with grabbing 12 rebounds, Sagaba Konate swatted seven shots, the most by a West Virginia player in 14 seasons and two off the school record.  Baylor committed 21 turnovers, mitigating a 44-37 rebounding edge.  Bears center Jo Lual-Acuil finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds, giving the underdogs a chance in a game that was tied six times and never stretched beyond a four-point margin in the second half.  The Mountaineers didn\u2019t take their first lead until 18:59 remained when West\u2019s jumper made it 31-29.  Baylor jumped out to a 13-4 lead and never trailed in the first half, though its lead vanished when Beetle Bolden\u2019s 3 from the wing forged a 29-29 tie.

Several dozen National Football League players kneeled, sat or locked arms during \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d in the regular season, drawing rebukes from President Donald Trump who called it unpatriotic. Game broadcasters showed the protests during the initial weeks but reduced coverage of them later.  The anthem is typically shown live before the Super Bowl and this year will be performed by pop singer Pink at the Feb. 4 championship.  If any players decide to kneel at the Super Bowl, NBC will cover it, executive producer Fred Gaudelli said at a Television Critics Association event in Pasadena, California.   \u201cWhen you are covering a live event, you are covering what\u2019s happening,\u201d Gaudelli said. \u201cIf there are players who choose to kneel, they will be shown live.\u201d   Announcers likely will identify the players, explain the reasons behind the actions, \u201cand then get on with the game,\u201d Gaudelli said.   He also noted that the number of protests had waned since Thanksgiving.  The players who kneeled during the regular season said they were protesting the killing by police of unarmed black men and boys across the United States, as well as racial disparities in the criminal justice system.

The payment was shown in the accounts of Apple Europe, one of the group\u2019s UK subsidiaries, which said \u201cthis payment of additional tax and interest reflects the company\u2019s increased activity\u201d.  Burger chain Byron said on Tuesday 20 of its 67 outlets across the UK, which employ about 1,800 people, could be closed as part of a sweeping restructuring plan, known as a company voluntary agreement.  Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism police chief Mark Rowley was to step down, in a move that risks complicating the struggle against extremist violence amid a sharp upturn in the threat. Rowley, Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations of the Metropolitan Police, was leaving policing to \u201cpursue other challenges,\u201d the Metropolitan Police Service said.  British retailer Marks and Spencer Group Plc, which is battling to turn itself around, said it would cut its technology bill by reducing suppliers and focus its IT business on India\u2019s Tata Consultancy Services Ltd as principal technology partner.  Rio Tinto has accepted an offer for its Dunkerque aluminium smelter, Europe\u2019s biggest producer of the lightweight metal, from acquisitive UK industrialist Sanjeev Gupta. The planned purchase, which could be announced as soon as Wednesday, is the latest in a spree of deals by Gupta. (Compiled by Bengaluru newsroom; Editing by Sandra Maler)"

Govan posted his 10th double-double of the season with 18 points and 13 rebounds. He made 7 of 19 shots and his only 3-pointer of the night (in three tries) when he spotted up from the top of the key and scored while St. John\u2019s Tariq Owens defended him.  The big night by the junior forward gave Patrick Ewing his first coaching victory over Chris Mullin. The former standouts for Georgetown and St. John\u2019s last opposed each other in a college game in the Final Four at Rupp Arena in Lexington in 1985.  Marcus Derrickson added 17 and eight rebounds for Georgetown (12-4, 2-3 Big East), which won despite shooting 33.3 percent (20 of 60).

          "body": "* Brent, WTI crude at highest level since start of the oil slump  * Asian crude oil grades already average above $70 per barrel  * OPEC cuts, global markets rally have pushed up oil prices  * But analysts warn of overheated market  By Henning Gloystein  SINGAPORE, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices hit their highest levels since 2014 on Wednesday due to ongoing production cuts led by OPEC as well as healthy demand, although analysts cautioned that markets may be overheating.  A broad global market rally, including stocks, has also been fuelling investment into crude oil futures.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $63.40 a barrel at 0100 GMT - 44 cents, or 0.7 percent, above their last settlement. They marked a December-2014 high of $63.53 a barrel in early trading.  Brent crude futures were at $69.15 a barrel, 33 cents, or 0.5 percent, above their last close. Brent touched $69.29 in late Tuesday trading, its strongest since an intra-day spike in May 2015 and, before that, in December 2014.  \u201cThe extension of the OPEC agreement ... and declining inventories are all helping to drive the price higher,\u201d said William O\u2019Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia\u2019s Rivkin Securities.  In an effort to prop up prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) together with Russia and a group of other producers last November extended an output cut deal that was due to expire in March this year to cover all of 2018.  The cuts, which have mostly targeted Europe and North America, was aimed at reducing a global supply overhang that had dogged oil markets since 2014.  The American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday that crude inventories fell by 11.2 million barrels in the week to Jan. 5, to 416.6 million barrels.  Official U.S. Energy Information Administration data is due at 1530 GMT on Wednesday.  Amid the general bull-run, which has pushed up crude prices by more than 13 percent since early December, there are indicators of an overheated market.  In the United States, crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA is expected to break through 10 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, reaching levels only Russia and Saudi Arabia have.  In Asia, the world\u2019s biggest oil consumer region, refiners are suffering from high prices and ample fuel supplies.  \u201cOne area of concern, particularly in Asia, is that of (low) refining margins ... This drop in margins could reduce Asian refiners\u2019 demand for incremental crude in the near term and weigh on global prices,\u201d said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta.  Average Singapore refinery margins DUB-SIN-REF this week fell below $6 per barrel, their lowest seasonal value in five years, due to high fuel availability but also because the recent rise in feedstock crude prices dented profits.  Asian oil prices are higher than in the rest of the world.  While Brent and WTI are still below $70 per barrel, the average price for Asian crude oil grades has already risen above that level, to $70.62 per barrel, Thomson Reuters Eikon data showed.

Several dozen National Football League players kneeled, sat or locked arms during \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d in the regular season, drawing rebukes from President Donald Trump who called it unpatriotic. Game broadcasters showed the protests during the initial weeks but reduced coverage of them later.  The anthem is typically shown live before the Super Bowl and this year will be performed by pop singer Pink at the Feb. 4 championship.  If any players decide to kneel at the Super Bowl, NBC will cover it, executive producer Fred Gaudelli said at a Television Critics Association event in Pasadena, California.   \u201cWhen you are covering a live event, you are covering what\u2019s happening,\u201d Gaudelli said. \u201cIf there are players who choose to kneel, they will be shown live.\u201d   Announcers likely will identify the players, explain the reasons behind the actions, \u201cand then get on with the game,\u201d Gaudelli said.   He also noted that the number of protests had waned since Thanksgiving.  The players who kneeled during the regular season said they were protesting the killing by police of unarmed black men and boys across the United States, as well as racial disparities in the criminal justice system. More than half of all NFL players are black.  The Super Bowl is the year\u2019s most-watched U.S. television broadcast, attracting an audience of more than 100 million people.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - What do you get when you cross the feverish world of crypto-currencies and a faded industrial icon desperate for a new lease on life? The answer, provided Tuesday by Eastman Kodak, is KodakCoin.  The iconic company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 after fumbling the shift to digital images. Now it\u2019s betting its future on digital currencies with an initial coin offering designed to help photographers sell their work. The crypto buzz more than doubled its stock, but it\u2019s unlikely to do anything like the same to the company\u2019s sales or profit.  The Rochester, New York-based company emerged from bankruptcy in 2013 relieved of much of its debts and patents. It refocused around digital printing, packaging and a legacy film business that\u2019s a shadow of the glory days when Paul Simon had a hit song rhapsodizing about Kodachrome. None of those has caught on. Sales fell by a third in the first three years after bankruptcy. They dropped another 8 percent in the first three quarters of 2017, to $1.1 billion, and the bottom line dipped into the red. The company\u2019s market cap, nearly $30 billion at its peak in the late 1990s, fell to just $135 million early this week.  The announcement of the planned blockchain platform and initial coin offering changed the stock\u2019s trajectory on the day. Kodak is just the latest to see the potential halo effect of crypto-currencies after bitcoin soared some 14-fold in 2017. In December, stock in tiny Long Island Iced Tea tripled after it renamed itself Long Blockchain.  Startups raised more than $3 billion with ICOs last year, led by Filecoin, a blockchain data-storage network that raked in $257 million. Yet the field is growing crowded. ICO Alert lists roughly 80 offerings currently in the market and a similar number planning to launch in the next two months.  Kodak Chief Executive Jeffrey Clarke will take whatever he can get. The company has been looking for assets to sell to pay down some of its $845 million in debt, according to Eikon data. A blockchain platform could give photographers a better way to license their images and receive payment. But it\u2019s hard to see how that will reverse Kodak\u2019s decades-long decline.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Job vacancies in Australia climbed to their highest on record in the three months to November, a sixth straight quarter of solid gains that augured well for continued growth in hiring.  Total job vacancies rose 2.7 percent to 210,300 seasonally adjusted in the Sept-Nov quarter, from 204,800 in the previous quarter, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday.  That was the highest reading since the series began in 1979 and left vacancies a healthy 16 percent higher than a year earlier.  Vacancies in the private sector climbed 3.8 percent to 192,000, again the highest on record. That was up 17.3 percent on the previous year.  In contrast, public sector vacancies fell back 7.6 percent in the November quarter to 18,300.  Analysts value the vacancies series as it has proved a reliable leading indicator of labor demand and turning points in employment growth.  The strength in vacancies supports official figures for employment which showed a surge in hiring last year, driving the jobless rate down to 5.4 percent.

          "body": "* 10-year U.S. Treasury yields at highest since March  * Yen still underpinned by BOJ\u2019s bond buying reduction  By Lisa Twaronite  TOKYO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up in early Asian trade on Wednesday, bolstered by higher U.S. Treasury yields but still constrained against the yen after the Bank of Japan\u2019s move to trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds triggered tapering fears.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rival currencies, inched up slightly to 92.536, not far from its overnight high of 92.640.  The euro was slightly lower on the day at $1.1933, well below its nearly four-month high of $1.2089 set last Thursday.  Against the yen, the dollar was slightly lower at 112.62 , struggling to make headway in the wake of a 0.5 percent drop in the previous session when Japan\u2019s central bank slightly reduced the amount of its Japanese government bond (JGB) purchases in its regular buying operations.  While the move was a technical tweak in line with the central bank\u2019s policies to date, it unleashed a wave of speculation that the BOJ could be poised to unwind its massive, ultra-easy monetary stimulus.  Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note reached a 10-month high on Tuesday, partly lifted by the BOJ\u2019s action.  The 10-year note yield stood at 2.551 percent in Asian trading, up from its U.S. close of 2.546 percent on Tuesday, when it rose as high as 2.555 percent, its highest since March.  \u201cThe BOJ\u2019s move reminded traders of the fact that major central banks are willing to normalize their monetary policy,\u201d said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.  \u201cI think this unwanted strengthening of the yen will make the BOJ more cautious in going forward, when they want to move toward normalization,\u201d he said.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Tuesday that software patches released to guard against microchip security threats slowed down some personal computers and servers, with systems running on older Intel Corp (INTC.O) processors seeing a noticeable decrease in performance.  The comments in a blog post were the clearest signal from Microsoft that fixes for flaws in microchips from Intel and rivals described last week could meaningfully degrade performance. The topic is of keen interest to large data center operators, which could incur significant cost increases if computers slow down.  Microsoft also said that security updates froze some computers using chipsets from Intel rival AMD (AMD.O), dragging AMD\u2019s shares down nearly 4 percent.  Shares in Intel, which reiterated on Tuesday that it saw no sign of significant slowdown in computers, fell 2.5 percent taking the loss since the issue surfaced last week to about 7 percent or around $15 billion in market value.  AMD shares have gained nearly 20 percent in the last week as investors speculated that the chipmaker could wrest market share from Intel, whose chips were most exposed to the security flaws.  Security researchers disclosed the flaws on Jan. 3 that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, AMD and ARM Holdings, owned by Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T).  \"We (and others in the industry) had learned of this vulnerability under nondisclosure agreement several months ago and immediately began developing engineering mitigations and updating our cloud infrastructure,\" Microsoft executive Terry Myerson wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. (bit.ly/2mj6f3Q)  Internet and networking equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) said in a security advisory updated on Tuesday that it has identified 18 vulnerable products, including some of its blade servers, rack servers and routers, and expects to have patches for servers in about five weeks, on February 18.    Cisco said it is also looking for problems in nearly 30 other products, including switches and routers. The majority of Cisco\u2019s products were not vulnerable because they are \u201cclosed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code on the device,\u201d it said. The memory corruption flaws, named Meltdown and Spectre, could allow hackers to bypass operating systems and other security software to steal passwords or encryption keys on most types of computers, phones and cloud-based servers.  ARM Holdings estimated that around 5 percent of more than 120 billion chips its partners have shipped since 1991 was impacted by Spectre. It said the number of chips affected by Meltdown was significantly less.  \u201cARM will address Spectre in future processors but there will need to be an ongoing discipline in the design of secure systems which needs to be addressed through both software and hardware,\u201d a company spokesman said in an emailed statement.   Intel and AMD have not disclosed the number of chips affected by the security flaws.  Intel said a typical home and business PC user should not see significant slowdowns in common tasks such as reading email, writing a document or accessing digital photos. (intel.ly/2FiL0Hk)  The chipmaker said last week that fixes for security issues in its microchips would not slow down computers, rebuffing concerns that the flaws would significantly reduce performance.  Rival AMD had also played down the threat, saying its products were at \u201czero risk\u201d from the Meltdown flaw, but that one variant of the Spectre bug could be resolved by software updates from vendors such as Microsoft.  But on Tuesday AMD said it was aware of an issue with some older-generation processors following the installation of a Microsoft security update that was published over the weekend.  Microsoft said it was working with AMD to resolve the issues.  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) also released an updated version of its operating system software on Monday to fix the security flaw.

          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - The new U.S. tax law is poised to drive more control over the nation\u2019s grain supply to farmer-owned cooperatives, provoking concern among ethanol producers and privately run grain handlers that they could be squeezed out of the competition to buy crops.  Until now, the cooperatives, private companies and publicly traded firms had a more even opportunity to handle the grain supply used in everything from loaves of bread in supermarkets to livestock feed.  The changes mean massive grain traders such as Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] could find it difficult to source corn, soybeans and wheat.  The perceived threat to these companies stems from a provision included in the final stages of the law\u2019s passage in December. It gives farmers such a big tax deduction for selling their produce to agricultural cooperatives that private firms fear their grains supply will dry up.  The provision was championed by Republican farm state senators including John Thune of South Dakota and John Hoeven of North Dakota.  Privately held Cargill said on Tuesday it was surprised the provision was added to the bill at the last minute and is evaluating its potential impact.   Rival ADM, which also produces ethanol, said it too was evaluating the provision and \u201cvarious potential solutions\u201d to it.     The new tax law allows farmers and ranchers to claim a 20 percent deduction on all payments received on sales to cooperatives.  \u201cIt is going to put us out of business as a private if something is not changed right off the bat,\u201d said Doug Bell, president and general manager of Bell Enterprises Inc, which operates grain elevators in central Illinois.  \u201cThere is just no reason whatsoever why a farmer would do business with anyone other than a co-op.\u201d  The deductions could come as a massive boon to cash-strapped U.S. grain farmers, who have struggled for at least four years amid a global grain glut and sluggish commodity prices.  Some farmers seeking to take advantage of the new deduction are already asking about transferring grain they have stored at private elevators and selling it to cooperatives, Bell said. An association that represents cooperatives also has received questions from people who want to open new cooperatives.  The change focuses on a provision in the federal tax code that cuts taxes on proceeds from agricultural products \u2013 whether corn and soybeans, or milk and fresh fruit \u2013 that farmers and ranchers sell to farm cooperatives such as CHS Inc.  There is no comparable provision for farmers doing the same business with private or investor-owned companies.  \u201cThe advantage for the farmer is probably at least five times larger selling to a co-op versus not selling to a co-op,\u201d said Paul Neiffer, an accountant at CliftonLarsonAllen in Yakima, Washington.   Neiffer said he has received hundreds of calls and emails from private elevators upset about the law.  Chuck Conner, president and chief executive of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, said his organization had begun to receive calls from people asking questions about starting a co-op to take advantage of the deduction.  \u201cThe producer/member deduction is more generous than most of us thought possible a few months ago,\u201d he said in an email to members.  The number of U.S. farm cooperatives has been steadily shrinking in recent years, as they scramble to consolidate and stay competitive amid the merger frenzy of major seed and chemical companies.   There were 1,953 farmer, rancher and fishery co-ops in 2016 in the United States, down 4.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture data. They handled $44.3 billion in net sales of grains in 2016, down 33 percent from a $66.3 billion peak in 2013.  CHS, the largest U.S. agricultural cooperative, said the new law ensures that \u201cthat cooperatives continue to be a driver of economic growth in rural America.\u201d  Additional reporting by P.J.

          "body": "SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A Latin American human rights court said on Tuesday that countries in the region should legalize same-sex unions, endorsing a growing push for marriage equality despite opposition from the Roman Catholic Church.   The Inter-American Court of Human Rights\u2019 decision came in response to a petition submitted two years ago by Costa Rican president Luis Guillermo Solis, who had vowed to increase rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the majority Catholic country.    A number of Latin American countries, including Costa Rica, do not allow same-sex marriage. However, that trend is changing and in recent years same-sex couples have been allowed to marry in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and some parts of Mexico, despite church opposition.   The Inter-American Court, based in Costa Rica\u2019s capital San Jose, said the countries that it oversees should treat same-sex couples \u201cwithout discrimination,\u201d ensuring that they receive the same family and financial rights as heterosexual couples.  It also recommended that these rights be ensured through temporary decrees while governments pursue permanent laws.  Costa Rica\u2019s government celebrated the decision, saying that lawmakers would take steps to adopt the court\u2019s criteria \u201cin its totality.\u201d  \u201cThe court ... reminds all states on the continent, including ours, of their obligation and historical debt toward this population,\u201d Costa Rica\u2019s vice president Ana Helena Chacon said at a press conference.

          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. aluminum products makers sought new trade protections against Chinese imports on Tuesday, accusing China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd and its affiliates of evading U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by shipping aluminum products through Vietnam.  In a filing with the U.S. Commerce Department, the Aluminum Extruders Council said that aluminum extrusions from Zhongwang affiliate Global Vietnam Aluminum Co should be subject to the same U.S. import duties as Chinese extrusions.  The duties are currently a combined 106 percent, according to the Commerce Department.  The anti-circumvention petition follows a number of U.S. actions to raise barriers to Chinese aluminum, including Commerce Department preliminary duties on Chinese aluminum foil and a rare U.S. government-initiated investigation into imports of Chinese aluminum alloy sheet products.  It also comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is considering much broader global restrictions on aluminum imports on national security grounds.  The Commerce Department is due to issue recommendations to Trump from its \u201cSection 232\u201d investigation into aluminum imports on Jan 22. Recommendations from a similar probe into steel imports are due on Jan. 16, but it is not clear whether either report will immediately be made public.  China\u2019s excess production capacity of both metals has emerged as a major trade irritant for the United States and Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports.  In the Vietnam petition, the Aluminum Extruders Council said it provided evidence that Zhongwang\u2019s affiliate in Vietnam was changing the shape and form of Chinese extrusions in minor ways but claiming their origin as Vietnamese.  \u201cThese blatant attempts to evade duties and flood the market with unfairly traded Chinese aluminum extrusions must be halted,\u201d the trade group\u2019s president, Jeff Henderson, said in a statement.  In June, the Commerce Department ordered that fabricated aluminum pallets imported from China should be subject to the U.S. duties after determining that they were part of a duty evasion scheme. The Aluminum Extruders Council argued that these products are being shipped through Vietnam with minor changes.  The Commerce Department has shown receptiveness to similar anti-circumvention cases in the steel sector. In December, the agency slapped steep duties on steel products from Vietnam that originated as Chinese made hot-rolled steel.  Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Lisa Shumaker"

          "body": "SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North and South Korea held their first talks in over two years on Tuesday, which Washington welcomed as a first step to solving the North Korean nuclear weapons crisis, even though Pyongyang said those were aimed only at the United States and not up for discussion.  The U.S. State Department said Washington would be interested in joining future talks, but stuck to its insistence that they must be aimed at denuclearization, showing that a diplomatic breakthrough remains far off.  In a joint statement after 11 hours of talks, North and South Korea said they had agreed to hold military to military talks and that North Korea would send a large delegation to next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in South Korea.  However, North Korea made a \u201cstrong complaint\u201d after Seoul proposed talks to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.  \u201cClearly this is a positive development,\u201d a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Steve Goldstein, said of the joint statement, while adding: \u201cWe would like nuclear talks to occur; we want denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This is a good first step in that process.\u201d  North and South Korea said they agreed to meet again to resolve problems and avert accidental conflict, amid high tension over North Korea\u2019s program to develop nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States.  \u201cAll our weapons, including atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs and ballistic missiles, are only aimed at the United States, not our brethren, nor China and Russia,\u201d Pyongyang\u2019s chief negotiator, Ri Son Gwon, said.  \u201cThis is not a matter between North and South Korea, and to bring up this issue would cause negative consequences and risks turning all of today\u2019s good achievement into nothing,\u201d Ri said in closing remarks.  The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment on the United States being the only potential target of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons.  U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have exchanged threats and insults in the past year, raising fears of a new war on the peninsula.  The United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War, initially responded coolly to the idea of inter-Korean meetings, but Trump later called them \u201ca good thing\u201d and said he would be willing to speak to Kim.  \u201cAt the appropriate time, we\u2019ll get involved,\u201d Trump said on Saturday, although U.S.-North Korean talks appear unlikely any time soon, given entrenched positions on both sides.  The United States has warned that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea.  Washington agreed with Seoul last week to postpone joint military exercises that Pyongyang denounces as rehearsals for invasion until after the Olympics, but the North-South thaw has not altered the U.S. intelligence assessment of North Korea\u2019s weapons programs.   The consensus, according to U.S. officials familiar with the classified analysis, is that Kim remains convinced the United States is determined to overthrow him and that only a nuclear arsenal that threatens America can deter that.  One official said the North-South talks were likely to follow the pattern of past diplomatic efforts, in which the North has benefited from additional food and other aid without making any concessions on the weapons front.  The additional danger now, said a second official, was that Kim would seek to use the talks to take advantage of Trump\u2019s sometimes bellicose rhetoric to try to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the talks, particularly the agreement to hold military-to-military talks, calling this \u201ccritical to lowering the risk of miscalculation\u201d.  He also welcomed North Korea\u2019s decision to send a delegation to the Olympics and said he hoped for the resumption of dialogue leading to denuclearization.  In spite of the North Korean negotiator\u2019s remarks, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said it believed Tuesday\u2019s talks could lead to discussion of a \u201cfundamental resolution\u201d of the nuclear issue.  \u201cWe will closely coordinate with the United States, China, Japan and other neighbors in this process,\u201d it said, adding that Seoul had asked Pyongyang to halt acts that stoke tension.  Tuesday\u2019s meeting followed a year of ramped-up North Korean missile test launches, some of them over Japanese territory, and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, which prompted a U.S.-led campaign to toughen U.N. sanctions.   The U.S. State Department said later in the day that it had approved the sale of anti-ballistic missiles to Japan to defend itself.  North Korea-South Korea talks: tmsnrt.rs/2Ar8lUu  North Korea revealed: reut.rs/2z4KDPt  Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2miGPDI  Earlier on Tuesday, Seoul said it was prepared to lift some unilateral sanctions temporarily so North Koreans could visit for the Olympics. North Korea said its delegation would include athletes, high-ranking officials, a cheering squad, art performers, reporters and spectators.  Talks to work out details would be held soon, the South\u2019s Unification Ministry said.  Tuesday\u2019s talks were the first between the two Koreas since 2015 and were held at the Peace House on the South Korean side of Panmunjom truce village.  Seoul said it proposed reunions of divided families in time for February\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday, but the joint statement made no mention of any agreement on this.  Seoul said North Korea had finished technical work to restore a military hotline, with normal communications set to resume on Wednesday.  North Korea cut communications in February 2016, following  South Korea\u2019s decision to shut down a jointly run industrial park.  Seoul also said North Korea responded \u201cpositively\u201d to the South\u2019s proposal for athletes from both sides to march together in the Olympic opening ceremony.  Such a joint parade has not happened since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China.  China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it was happy to see talks between North and South Korea and welcomed all positive steps. Russia echoed the sentiment. \u201cThis is exactly the kind of dialogue that we said was necessary,\u201d a Kremlin spokesman said.  Some U.S.-based analysts have hailed the talks as an opening for diplomacy, but others see an attempt by North Korea to weaken U.S. pressure so that it is eventually accepted as a nuclear-armed state.  Evans Revere, a former senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, said that by engaging Seoul, North Korea was clearly seeking to weaken the U.S.-South Korean alliance and it was important that Seoul had raised the nuclear issue to show it was not just a U.S.-North Korea matter.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators met with administration officials on Tuesday to discuss drafting legislation to spend $1 trillion on improving the country\u2019s infrastructure, a goal that President Trump made a priority in the 2016 elections.   Passing an infrastructure bill in the Republican-controlled Congress to improve U.S. infrastructure like roads, airports, ports and railways, will likely require support from the Democratic party in the Senate where Republicans only have a slender majority.  Some Democrats have expressed a desire to see a bill passed, but mid-term congressional elections in November this year could make the politics of a bipartisan effort difficult.  Congress would need to find a way to fund an expensive infrastructure package and the cost could cause both Democrats and Republicans to oppose the legislation.   Many Republicans want to use private sector investment to finance infrastructure projects to avoid increasing the national debt but Democrats think that government money is necessary to produce such a large package.  In its quadrennial report on U.S. infrastructure in 2017, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave the country a \u201cD\u201d or failing grade for the state of its bridges, roads, dams, drinking water, ports, airports, railways and school buildings.   The ASCE said the U.S. currently needs to spend more than $2 trillion to upgrade its infrastructure in the next decade.   In international comparisons, the U.S. currently ranks 12th out of 138 countries for the quality of infrastructure, according to the World Economic Forum.

Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that would oversee an infrastructure bill, said the meeting was an opportunity for the administration to explain its priorities.  \u201cThe meeting gave senators the chance to have a direct back-and-forth with administration leadership on their priorities,\u201d Barrasso said in a statement.   Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the committee,  praised the meeting as an opportunity to work with the administration.   \u201cWhile there is no shortage of issues on which the president and I disagree, the kind of large scale trillion dollar infrastructure investment that then-candidate Trump talked about is something that has the potential to elicit bipartisan support here in Congress,\u201d Carper said in a statement.

          "title": "U.S. hails Korea talks, despite North's rejection of denuclearization",
          "body": "SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North and South Korea held their first talks in over two years on Tuesday, which Washington welcomed as a first step to solving the North Korean nuclear weapons crisis, even though Pyongyang said those were aimed only at the United States and not up for discussion.  The U.S. State Department said Washington would be interested in joining future talks, but stuck to its insistence that they must be aimed at denuclearization, showing that a diplomatic breakthrough remains far off.  In a joint statement after 11 hours of talks, North and South Korea said they had agreed to hold military to military talks and that North Korea would send a large delegation to next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in South Korea.  However, North Korea made a \u201cstrong complaint\u201d after Seoul proposed talks to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.  \u201cClearly this is a positive development,\u201d a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Steve Goldstein, said of the joint statement, while adding: \u201cWe would like nuclear talks to occur; we want denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This is a good first step in that process.\u201d  North and South Korea said they agreed to meet again to resolve problems and avert accidental conflict, amid high tension over North Korea\u2019s program to develop nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States.  \u201cAll our weapons, including atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs and ballistic missiles, are only aimed at the United States, not our brethren, nor China and Russia,\u201d Pyongyang\u2019s chief negotiator, Ri Son Gwon, said.  \u201cThis is not a matter between North and South Korea, and to bring up this issue would cause negative consequences and risks turning all of today\u2019s good achievement into nothing,\u201d Ri said in closing remarks.  The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment on the United States being the only potential target of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons.  U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have exchanged threats and insults in the past year, raising fears of a new war on the peninsula.  The United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War, initially responded coolly to the idea of inter-Korean meetings, but Trump later called them \u201ca good thing\u201d and said he would be willing to speak to Kim.  \u201cAt the appropriate time, we\u2019ll get involved,\u201d Trump said on Saturday, although U.S.-North Korean talks appear unlikely any time soon, given entrenched positions on both sides.  The United States has warned that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea.  Washington agreed with Seoul last week to postpone joint military exercises that Pyongyang denounces as rehearsals for invasion until after the Olympics, but the North-South thaw has not altered the U.S. intelligence assessment of North Korea\u2019s weapons programs.   The consensus, according to U.S. officials familiar with the classified analysis, is that Kim remains convinced the United States is determined to overthrow him and that only a nuclear arsenal that threatens America can deter that.  One official said the North-South talks were likely to follow the pattern of past diplomatic efforts, in which the North has benefited from additional food and other aid without making any concessions on the weapons front.  The additional danger now, said a second official, was that Kim would seek to use the talks to take advantage of Trump\u2019s sometimes bellicose rhetoric to try to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the talks, particularly the agreement to hold military-to-military talks, calling this \u201ccritical to lowering the risk of miscalculation\u201d.  He also welcomed North Korea\u2019s decision to send a delegation to the Olympics and said he hoped for the resumption of dialogue leading to denuclearization.  In spite of the North Korean negotiator\u2019s remarks, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said it believed Tuesday\u2019s talks could lead to discussion of a \u201cfundamental resolution\u201d of the nuclear issue.  \u201cWe will closely coordinate with the United States, China, Japan and other neighbors in this process,\u201d it said, adding that Seoul had asked Pyongyang to halt acts that stoke tension.  Tuesday\u2019s meeting followed a year of ramped-up North Korean missile test launches, some of them over Japanese territory, and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, which prompted a U.S.-led campaign to toughen U.N. sanctions.   The U.S. State Department said later in the day that it had approved the sale of anti-ballistic missiles to Japan to defend itself.  North Korea-South Korea talks: tmsnrt.rs/2Ar8lUu  North Korea revealed: reut.rs/2z4KDPt  Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2miGPDI  Earlier on Tuesday, Seoul said it was prepared to lift some unilateral sanctions temporarily so North Koreans could visit for the Olympics. North Korea said its delegation would include athletes, high-ranking officials, a cheering squad, art performers, reporters and spectators.  Talks to work out details would be held soon, the South\u2019s Unification Ministry said.  Tuesday\u2019s talks were the first between the two Koreas since 2015 and were held at the Peace House on the South Korean side of Panmunjom truce village.  Seoul said it proposed reunions of divided families in time for February\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday, but the joint statement made no mention of any agreement on this.  Seoul said North Korea had finished technical work to restore a military hotline, with normal communications set to resume on Wednesday.  North Korea cut communications in February 2016, following  South Korea\u2019s decision to shut down a jointly run industrial park.  Seoul also said North Korea responded \u201cpositively\u201d to the South\u2019s proposal for athletes from both sides to march together in the Olympic opening ceremony.  Such a joint parade has not happened since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China.  China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it was happy to see talks between North and South Korea and welcomed all positive steps. Russia echoed the sentiment. \u201cThis is exactly the kind of dialogue that we said was necessary,\u201d a Kremlin spokesman said.  Some U.S.-based analysts have hailed the talks as an opening for diplomacy, but others see an attempt by North Korea to weaken U.S. pressure so that it is eventually accepted as a nuclear-armed state.  Evans Revere, a former senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, said that by engaging Seoul, North Korea was clearly seeking to weaken the U.S.-South Korean alliance and it was important that Seoul had raised the nuclear issue to show it was not just a U.S.-North Korea matter.

          "body": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - A three-judge federal panel ordered congressional districts in North Carolina to be redrawn ahead of the 2018 elections, ruling on Tuesday that the Republican-drawn map was illegal and unconstitutionally partisan.  The ruling was the first time that a federal court blocked a congressional map because of partisan gerrymandering, said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice.  The judges in a 191-page ruling said the state legislator responsible for the 2016 map had said he drew it to give Republican candidates an advantage.   \u201cBut that is not a choice the Constitution allows legislative map drawers to make,\u201d the court said.  The panel gave the state until Jan. 29 to file a proposed remedial plan with the court. Congressional elections are scheduled for November across the United States.  Ralph Hise, North Carolina\u2019s state Senate Redistricting Chairman, said through a spokeswoman that lawmakers would appeal.  Dallas Woodhouse, the state\u2019s Republican Party Executive Director, said in a statement that the ruling usurped legislative authority and amounted to \u201cpartisan war on North Carolina Republican voters.\u201d  Democrats and the groups that brought the lawsuit applauded.  \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a major victory for North Carolina and people across the state whose voices were silenced by Republicans\u2019 unconstitutional attempts to rig the system to their partisan advantage,\u201d North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin said in a statement.  NYU\u2019s Li said that if the North Carolina case is upheld upon appeal it would have far-reaching implications.  \u201cThe courts will have signaled that there are, in fact, limits of how far you can go with partisan gerrymandering,\u201d Li said.    The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule later this year on Wisconsin\u2019s appeal of a lower court ruling that state Republican lawmakers created unconstitutional state legislative districts with the partisan aim of hobbling Democrats in legislative races.  The Supreme Court has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination, as it did last May when it found that Republican legislators in North Carolina had drawn two electoral districts to diminish the statewide political clout of black voters. But the justices have not thrown out state electoral maps drawn simply to give one party an advantage over another.  Republicans in North Carolina could decide to seek a stay of the ruling until the Supreme Court decides the Wisconsin case, said Virginia Tech political scientist Nicholas Goedert.

          "title": "Ex-Arizona sheriff Arpaio running for Senate",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff known for his tough stance on illegal immigration and who received a criminal pardon from President Donald Trump, announced on Tuesday that he would run for the U.S. Senate.   Arpaio\u2019s positions on immigration and treatment of prisoners while sheriff made him a national conservative celebrity and liberal foe. He will seek to replace retiring Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who has been a frequent critic of Trump.  The 85-year-old Arpaio was convicted in July of criminal contempt of court in a racial profiling case, but subsequently received a pardon from the president. In announcing his bid, Arpaio immediately positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Trump, who won Arizona by 5 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election.  Arpaio\u2019s candidacy is likely to generate headaches for Republicans in Washington, who are desperate to hold on to the Arizona Senate seat or risk losing control of the chamber.  Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate, and will defend eight seats in November\u2019s election - when voters will decide who holds 34 Senate and all 435 House seats. Democrats, bolstered by an unexpected win in the Alabama special Senate race, are hoping to capitalize on unhappiness with Trump to gain control of Congress.  The seat is being vacated by Flake, who in announcing his retirement, called Trump\u2019s manner of governing \u201creckless, outrageous and undignified.\u201d  Flake dismissed Arpaio\u2019s candidacy on Tuesday.   \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s in it for the long haul,\u201d Flake said on MSNBC. \u201cI think by this time next month, he may not be in the race.\u201d  Democrats could also use Arpaio\u2019s record to smear Republican candidates elsewhere by association, invoking the former sheriff\u2019s criminal conviction and views on immigration.     Arizona holds one of the latest primary contests, not voting until August, which could allow Arpaio to remain in the spotlight for months.  Arpaio could use his celebrity and a vast mailing list to raise money without the support of deep-pocketed donors.      \u201cJoe Arpaio has 100 percent name recognition with voters,\u201d Stan Barnes, a Republican political strategist in Arizona, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd for all intents and purposes he\u2019s going to be wearing a Donald Trump mask and run as if he is Donald Trump, and with that added together he cannot be dismissed as a candidate.\u201d  After 24 years in office, Arpaio, who dubbed himself \u201cthe toughest sheriff in America,\u201d lost a bid for re-election in 2016 in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County, one of the largest counties in the United States. But he remained in the spotlight as legal challenges to his tenure continued.  A federal judge ruled in July that Arpaio wilfully violated a 2011 injunction barring his officers from detaining Latino drivers solely on the suspicion that they were in the county illegally.   The U.S. Department of Justice said in a 2011 report that Arpaio had nurtured a culture in his office of racially discriminating against Latinos, in breach of the U.S Constitution, a charge Arpaio denied.  His tactics made him one of the most widely known sheriffs in the country. He erected a tent city to house prisoners, reinstated chain gangs, made inmates wear uniforms that were pink or had old-fashioned black-and-white stripes and forbade them coffee, salt and pepper.   Arpaio joins an already contentious primary contest - the latest example of an ongoing internal struggle in the Republican Party between mainstream officials and more conservative factions.      Arpaio will have to compete for right-wing support with candidate Kelli Ward, a former doctor and Arizona state senator who has already made a failed bid for the U.S. Senate as a conservative.   Ward has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Arpaio and welcomed him to the race, her campaign chairman, Ed Rollins, said in a statement.   \u201cHis candidacy shows that conservatives in Arizona are fed up with the status quo and know that we need senators who support President Trump and the (president\u2019s) America First agenda,\u201d Rollins said.  Republican leaders have been pushing for Martha McSally, seen as a more moderate candidate, to enter the race. The House of Representatives lawmaker is expected to announce her run on Friday, CNN reported.      The winner of the Democrat primary is likely to be Kyrsten Sinema, the first openly bisexual person elected to Congress.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s economy looks set for an underwhelming 2018, according to a major survey on Wednesday that showed businesses are in a subdued mood ahead of Brexit.  Companies continued to grapple with cost pressures in the last three months of 2017 and were reluctant to invest more, the British Chambers of Commerce\u2019s (BCC) Quarterly Economic Survey showed.   The services sector, which represents the lion\u2019s share of Britain\u2019s economy, continued to expand at a subdued pace, the BCC said. Manufacturers did better than services firms, but still reported a slowdown in both domestic and export sales.  Overall the survey suggested the economy grew modestly at the end of last year, after picking up slightly in the three months to September with quarterly growth of 0.4 percent - below a historic trend of nearer 0.6 percent.   \u201cThe economy is set to continue on an underwhelming growth trajectory over the near term with uncertainty over the impact of Brexit coupled with high inflation and weak productivity likely to dampen overall economic activity,\u201d the BCC\u2019s head of economics, Suren Thiru, said.  Economists polled by Reuters generally think the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy will expand modestly during 2018, underperforming most of its peers but doing better than the gloomy predictions made around the time of the shock vote to quit the European Union in mid-2016.  The survey of 7,000 companies - the largest of its type - showed the proportion of services companies reporting recruitment difficulties rose to 71 percent, the highest since records started in 1989.  The BCC warned that this could prove to be the biggest drag on businesses in 2018, and urged its members to train more staff, rather than simply complain about staff shortages.  More than a third of services companies expected to raise prices over the next three months, the most since late 2008.  That will concern Bank of England officials, since the BCC\u2019s gauges link well with official measures of producer prices that are a guide to future inflation pressure, even if past reports of skills shortages have not brought faster wage growth.  Last month the BoE said inflation was likely to fall slowly in 2018. Consumer price inflation rose to its highest in nearly six years in November at 3.1 percent.    The central bank also anticipates a further improvement in business investment in 2018.   But the BCC survey showed no sign of a firm upswing in investment plans among either services or manufacturing companies, similar to a Deloitte survey of major company bosses out earlier this week.  Official data for industrial and construction output in November, as well as trade, are due at 0930 GMT.  Reporting by Andy Bruce, editing by David Milliken"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Alabama will be the site of a new $1.6 billion Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp auto plant, a victory for President Donald Trump who had prodded manufacturers to build new U.S. facilities and threatened tariffs on foreign production, sources said on Tuesday.  The plant, which will employ up to 4,000 people and produce about 300,000 vehicles a year, will be located in Huntsville, Alabama, and is a boon for the state, where Toyota has a large engine plant and an existing network of automotive suppliers.  A formal announcement by company and state officials is expected on Wednesday in Montgomery, sources briefed on the matter said.  The new plant \u2014in a state Trump won by 28 points in 2016 \u2014 could be a political boost to the Republican president, who has urged automakers to build plants in the United States and add jobs. The companies said they expect the plant to open in 2021.  Trump tweeted in March he wanted \u201cnew\u00a0plants to be built here for cars sold here.\u201d The White House did not immediately comment on Tuesday.  The announcement also comes at a time of declining U.S. auto industry sales, so it could exacerbate overcapacity and add pressure to cut prices. U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017, after hitting an all-time record high in 2016, and are expected to fall further in 2018.  Details of an anticipated tax and incentive package for the investment were not yet known. It has been reported the companies sought at least $1 billion in incentives.  A Toyota spokesman declined to comment, except to say an announcement was expected soon. A Mazda spokeswoman also declined to comment.  In recent months, the companies had narrowed their choices down to sites in Alabama and North Carolina.  Local media last month said the leading site under consideration was in northern Alabama\u2019s Limestone County, near Toyota\u2019s large engine plant in Huntsville. In September Toyota announced a $106 million technology upgrade for the Huntsville plant.\u00a0  A Chamber of Commerce of Huntsville website for the \u201cHuntsville Mega Site\u201d touts the fact it has been \u201ccertified as development-ready.\u201d The commerce chamber, local and state officials declined to comment on Tuesday on plans for the plant.  A year ago, President-elect Trump criticized Toyota and threatened\u00a0hefty tariffs against the Japanese automaker if it built its Corolla sedan for the U.S. market in Mexico.  \u201cToyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax,\u201d Trump posted on Twitter in early 2017.  Toyota and Mazda announced plans for a new plant in August. Toyota said it would shift production of Corollas from Canada to the new venture rather than in Guanajuato, and would build Tacoma pickups in Mexico instead. Mazda plans to build new crossover SUVs at the plant.  Trump praised the joint venture announcement, saying in August on Twitter: \u201cToyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!\u201d  In October, Toyota said it would scale back investment in a planned plant in Mexico by 30 percent to $700 million and cut planned annual capacity in half to 100,000 vehicles as it shuffles its production plans to meet market demands.  Toyota has 10 U.S. plants in eight states in an arc running from West Virginia through Kentucky, Indiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas.Toyota and Mazda announced a capital alliance in August and are exploring joint development of technologies for the basic structure of competitive electric vehicles.  Over the last 30 years Toyota, along with German and Asian automakers, has built a second auto industry in the United States, rivaling the operations of the Detroit Three automakers in size and employment, but with newer, and fewer unionized, plants.  States covet auto assembly plants because they typically pay above-average wages and spin off jobs at suppliers and service companies. Southern U.S. states have the advantage of good transportation infrastructure, business-friendly regulators and generally anti-union politicians.  The Alabama Department of Commerce shows 150 of the large automotive suppliers operate in the state, providing the logistical strength that Kristin Dziczek, a researcher at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, said helped land the plant.   Dziczek said that Alabama in 2017 was tied for fifth among U.S. states in auto production, at 9 percent with Tennessee. It was behind Michigan at 19 percent; Indiana at 12 percent, Kentucky at 11 percent; and Ohio at 10 percent.  \u201cThe impact of an auto assembly plant extends beyond its immediate economic impact, and that\u2019s why states offer robust incentives,\u201d said Dennis Cuneo, a site-selection consultant and former Toyota executive. \u201cIt creates a halo effect that in turn helps attract other projects.\u201d  Alabama spent an estimated $250 million to woo Daimler AG\u2019s Mercedes-Benz to put an auto plant in Tuscaloosa two decades ago.

          "body": "WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. investigators are looking at a range of theories, including the possibility of a \u201cviral\u201d attack, to explain what may have  sickened some American diplomats who were stationed in Havana, the State Department said on Tuesday.  U.S. experts have yet to determine who or what was behind the mysterious illnesses that began occurring in late 2016 and heightened tensions between the old Cold War foes. They have seen no evidence it was \u201can episode of mass hysteria\u201d among the 24 affected U.S. personnel and family members, a senior State Department medical officer told a Senate hearing.  State Department officials testified that it was \u201cincomprehensible\u201d Cuba\u2019s Communist government would not have been aware of what happened or who was responsible, though they stopped short of assigning direct blame to Havana.  Cuban officials, who are conducting their own investigation, have denied any involvement or any knowledge of what was behind it. Cuba\u2019s Foreign Ministry chief for U.S. Affairs Josefina Vidal sharply criticized the United States late on Tuesday for talking of \u201cattacks\u201d when they had no evidence of that.  \u201cThe first victim of today\u2019s hearing was the truth,\u201d she told a news conference in Havana, adding that Cuba rejected the U.S. politicization of the matter.  The administration of President Donald Trump, which has partly rolled back a detente with Cuba, responded last year by sharply drawing down U.S. embassy staff in Havana and in October expelled 15 Cuban diplomats.  Todd Brown, diplomatic security assistant director at the State Department, said that as well as the possibility of an  acoustic or sonic attack, U.S investigators were considering whether people might have been deliberately exposed to a virus. But he offered no details or evidence.  \u201cI do know other type of attacks are being considered in a connection with this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s viral, there is ultrasound, there\u2019s a range of things that the technical experts are looking at.\u201d  Some experts have argued that an acoustic attack seems implausible, given that it likely would have caused an extremely loud noise in the area, which was not the case.  Cuban officials have dismissed as \u201cscience fiction\u201d the notion that some kind of sonic weapon was used.  Lawmakers also asked whether rogue elements of the Cuban government or security services or a third party such as Russia might have been involved. The State Department officials said they could not address or speculate on such matters in a public hearing.  Symptoms suffered by the diplomats have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with \u201cmild traumatic brain injury,\u201d said Charles Rosenfarb, director of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Medical Services.  A U.S. official told Reuters the government will not send staff back to the U.S. Embassy in Havana yet. The United States pulled out more than half of its personnel there in September.  \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say categorically that we can guarantee that they would be safe from this (if staffers return),\u201d Brown told the hearing, chaired by Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American and strong critic of Cuba.  Francisco Palmieri, acting assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, said Cuba was responsible for the security of U.S. diplomats on the island \u201cand they have failed to live up to that responsibility.\u201d  Asked whether it was possible that the Cuban government would have been unaware of any attacks, he said: \u201cI find it very difficult to believe that. Cuba is a security state, the Cuban government in general has a very tight lid on anything and everything that happens in that country.\u201d  Senator Robert Menendez, a Cuban-American and ranking Democrat on the Western Hemisphere subcommittee, said Cuba had failed to meet its international obligations but also that the State Department response had been \u201cinadequate and troubling.\u201d  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will open a new high-level investigation into the matter, convening an accountability review board, Palmieri said. It will be in addition to other U.S. probes, including one by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Canada has said several Canadians reported symptoms similar to the U.S. diplomats but it has not publicly ordered any evacuation of embassy staff in Havana.  After decades of hostility between the United States and Cuba, the U.S. Embassy reopened in 2015 as part of moves by former President Barack Obama and his Cuban counterpart, Raul Castro, to mend ties. Relations have been strained since Trump took office, saying Obama made too many concessions and reversing parts of the rapprochement.

News of the sale comes as North and South Korea hold their first talks in more than two years aimed at solving the crisis over the North\u2019s nuclear missile program.  The missile deal follows a year of ramped-up North Korean missile launches, some of them over Japanese territory, and its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. These actions have prompted a stepped-up U.S.-led campaign to toughen U.N. sanctions, which Pyongyang has called an act of war.

          "title": "Focused Patriots 'ignore the noise' ahead of Titans clash",
          "body": "(Reuters) - The New England Patriots are no stranger to controversy and on Tuesday the players said they would not let a reports of internal turmoil within the organization distract them from their quest to repeat as Super Bowl champions.  A report last week said there was a rift between Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft but tight end Rob Gronkowski said he and team mates were not losing any sleep over it ahead of their playoff opener on Saturday.  \u201cThe reputation that coach tries to get us to have is just ignore the noise. Ignore the noise from the outside and I feel like that\u2019s what myself, a lot of other players have been doing,\u201d tight end Rob Gronkowski told reporters.  \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to keep ignoring the noise and just keep our focus on what we\u2019ve been doing all year and that\u2019s preparing hard, studying our opponent, getting ready mentally and physically for the big game.\u201d  Brady, Belichick and Kraft later issued a joint statement flatly denying the ESPN report.  The Patriots, who last year won their second Super Bowl title in three seasons, had a first-round bye after finishing atop the AFC and will host the Tennessee Titans on Saturday in the divisional round of the playoffs.  \u201cThe intensity has been high every single week all year long,\u201d said Gronkowski. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to keep on continuing that, keep on preparing how we have been and get ready for the big game.\u201d  Few NFL teams have faced controversy over recent years to the extent of the Patriots, and none have enjoyed their level of success.  Just last season, the Patriots overcame the NFL\u2019s four-game suspension of Brady stemming from a plot to deflate footballs used in the AFC title game two years prior.  In 2015, they blocked out the noise over \u2018Deflategate\u2019 to beat the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl.  In 2013 they dealt with the arrest and subsequent murder conviction of tight end Aaron Hernandez.  Six years before that, Belichick was fined $500,000 and the Patriots lost a first-round draft pick after an investigation found New England had videotaped an opponent\u2019s signals on the sidelines in what became known as \u2018Spygate.\u2019  Beyond all that, they have navigated through the mundane ups-and-downs of injuries and bad calls, reaching 11 AFC title games in the Brady-Belichick era practicing the Patriot Way of stressing personal accountability and a business-like approach.  Defensive back Devin McCourty, who has been a team captain since 2011, said the Patriots were not going to be motivated by the report but were fuelled by a desire to claim the franchise\u2019s sixth Super Bowl title.  \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t care about it and I think a lot of guys don\u2019t really care about what goes on outside and who writes what and if we suck, if we\u2019re great \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said McCourty. \u201cSo, I just think guys are motivated by playing for each other, their families more than an ESPN article.\u201d      Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto"

          "title": "Democrats vow to force vote on net neutrality",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats said on Tuesday they will force a vote later this year on the U.S. Federal Communications Commission\u2019s reversal of landmark Obama administration net neutrality rules and will try to make it a key issue in the 2018 congressional elections.  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the issue will be a major motivating factor for young voters the party is courting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let everyone know where we stand and they stand,\u201d Schumer said at a Capitol Hill news conference in Washington.  Democrats picked up a key vote when Republican Senator Susan Collins said on Tuesday she would back the effort to overturn the FCC\u2019s recent move. \u201cShe believes that a careful, deliberative process involving experts and the public is warranted to ensure that consumers have strong protections that guarantee consumer choice, free markets, and continued growth,\u201d a spokeswoman for Collins said.  The FCC voted in December along party lines to reverse rules introduced in 2015 that barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes. A group of state attorneys general immediately vowed to sue.  A trade group representing major tech companies including Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc said last week it will support legal challenges to the reversal.   The vote in December marked a victory for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc and hands them power over what content consumers can access over the internet. It was the biggest win for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations.  Senate Democrats on Tuesday called the FCC decision \u201cun-American\u201d and an \u201call-out assault on consumers.\u201d  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, backs the FCC repeal. A reversal of the FCC vote would need the approval of the Senate, U.S. House and President Donald Trump. Trump also backed the FCC action, the White House said last month.  The FCC order grants internet providers sweeping new powers to block, throttle or discriminate among internet content, but requires public disclosure of those practices. Internet providers have vowed not to change how consumers obtain online content.  Democrats say net neutrality is essential to protect consumers, while Republicans say the rules hindered investment by providers and were not needed.  Democratic Senator Ed Markey said on Tuesday he had 39 co-sponsors to force a vote, but it is not clear when the vote will occur since the new rules will not take effect for at least another three months. \u201cThere will be a political price to pay for those who are on the wrong side of history,\u201d Markey said.  Republicans control the Senate with 51 votes out of the 100-member body, so Democrats would need at least one more Republican to back overturning the FCC action.  Senator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, said the issue was resonating with teenagers and college students. \u201cPeople are mobilizing across the country to save the free and open internet,\u201d he said.

          "body": " (This January 5 story was corrected to change context of comments by Iran\u2019s UN ambassador as referring to \u201crecent violence in Iran\u201d instead of \u201crecent protests in Iran,\u201d paragraph 8.)  UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday to discuss recent protests in Iran turned into criticism of the United States for requesting to meet on what some member states said was an internal issue for Tehran.  France\u2019s ambassador to the UN said the protests do not threaten international peace and security, in what may be an implicit criticism of the United States.  \u201cAs worrisome as they may be, developments in recent days do not pose a threat to international peace and security,\u201d Ambassador Francois Delattre said.  \u201cWe must respond appropriately, that is, with all the vigilance required by the risks of violence against peaceful demonstrators, while avoiding any manipulation of this crisis, which would only reinforce the extremes and thus have the opposite of the effect we are seeking.\u201d  Demonstrations erupted in Iran over a week ago after the government announced plans to raise fuel prices and cut monthly cash handouts to lower-income Iranians. The unrest spread over 80 cities and towns and has resulted in 22 deaths and more than 1,000 arrests, according to Iranian officials.   The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, said Iran is \u201con notice,\u201d after listing what she referred to as slogans chanted by Iranian protesters.  \u201cThe Iranian regime\u2019s contempt for the rights of its people has been widely documented for many years,\u201d said Haley, adding that the United States stood \u201cunapologetically with those in Iran who seek freedom for themselves, prosperity for their families, and dignity for their nation. We will not be quiet. No dishonest attempt to call the protesters \u2018puppets of foreign powers\u2019 will change that.\u201d  Iran\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Gholamali Khoshroo told the Security Council that his government has \u201chard evidence\u201d that recent violence in Iran was \u201cvery clearly directed from abroad.\u201d  Khoshroo also said the United States had abused its power as a permanent member of the Security Council by calling for a meeting to discuss the protests.  \u201cIt is unfortunate that despite the resistance on the part of some of its members, this council has allowed itself to be abused by the current U.S. administration in holding a meeting on an issue that falls outside the scope of its mandate,\u201d he  said.  Russia\u2019s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the United States was abusing the Security Council\u2019s platform and the meeting was an attempt to use the current Iranian situation to undermine the Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. administration opposes.  Discussing the domestic situation of Iran at the council  \u201cdoes not help resolve the domestic issue of Iran,\u201d said China\u2019s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Wu Haitao.

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Thousands of government supporters staged rallies in Iran for a fourth day on Saturday in a backlash against widespread anti-government protests that the clerical establishment has blamed on the country\u2019s enemies.   Saturday\u2019s show of support took place a day after Iran\u2019s foreign minister said a United Nations Security Council meeting called by the United States to discuss the protests had proved a \u201cblunder\u201d by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.  State television showed rallies and marches in more than a dozen cities with demonstrators waving Iranian flags and chanting slogans including \u201cDeath to America\u201d, \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d and \u201cDeath to Britain\u201d.  More than a week of unrest has seen 22 people die and more than 1,000 arrested, according to Iranian officials, in the biggest anti-government protests for nearly a decade.   Unrest spread to more than 80 cities and rural towns as thousands of young and working-class Iranians voiced anger at graft, unemployment and a deepening gap between rich and poor.   Residents contacted by Reuters in various cities have said the protests had subsided in recent days, after the government intensified a crackdown by dispatching Revolutionary Guards forces to several provinces.  On Saturday, videos on social media showed a heavy police presence in cities, including Khorramabad in southwestern Iran where on Wednesday evening social media posts showed protesters throwing stones at riot police.  The protests have drawn largely young people and workers as well as members of the educated middle-class that formed the backbone of a pro-reform revolt almost a decade ago.   The provincial governor in northeastern Mashhad, where the protests started, was quoted as saying on Saturday that 85 percent of detainees there had been released after signing a pledge not to re-offend.  \u201cThose with a criminal record, or those charged with sabotage such as setting fire to motorcycles or damaging public buildings have been referred to judicial authorities,\u201d governor Alireza Rashidian told the ISNA news agency.  A police spokesman said most of those arrested were \u201cduped\u201d into joining the unrest and had been freed on bail, the state news agency IRNA reported. \u201cBut, the leaders of the unrest are held by the judiciary in prison.\u201d   Tehran University Vice-President Majid Sarsangi said the university had set up a committee to track the fate of students arrested during the unrest.  \u201cOur efforts at the university are aimed at cooperating with the relevant authorities to create the conditions for the return  of the detained students to the university and their families in the shortest possible time,\u201d Sarsangi told ISNA.  Separately, a member of parliament said about 90 students were detained, 10 of whom were still not accounted for.  \u201cIt seems that the total number of detainees is around 90. Ten students from universities in Tehran and some other cities are in an uncertain position, and ... it is still unknown which body has detained them,\u201d the labor news agency ILNA quoted reformist politician Mahmoud Sadeghi as saying.  Iran has several parallel security bodies and residents say arrests are often not immediately announced.  Videos that appeared on social media in recent days showed relatives of detainees gathering outside prisons seeking information about the fate of their loved ones.  In Europe, hundreds of Iranians held rallies on Saturday in support of the anti-government protests in Iran, in cities including Stockholm, London, Paris and Berlin.  About 400 people gathered in central Paris, and several hundred held a rally in front of Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate with Iranian flags, drums and banners calling for a change of government.    One of the protesters in Berlin, 18-year-old Pariya Kohandel Saleh, said her father was in jail in Iran for supporting the families of prisoners.  \u201cThings should be good in Iran now the sanctions have been lifted, but the mullahs\u2019 pockets are bottomless and everybody knows it,\u201d she told Reuters.  A United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday to discuss the protests turned into criticism of the United States for requesting to meet on what some member states said was an internal issue for Iran.  Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted: \u201cThe UNSC rebuffed the U.S.\u2019s naked attempt to hijack its mandate ... Another FP (foreign policy) blunder for the Trump administration.\u201d   Iran\u2019s elite Guards and its affiliated Basij militia suppressed unrest in 2009 over alleged election fraud, in which dozens of pro-reform Iranians were killed.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Steve Bannon has stepped down as executive chairman of Breitbart News, the right-wing news website said on Tuesday, after the former White House chief strategist drew fire from President Donald Trump for harshly criticizing his eldest son.  Bannon was quoted in a new book about the Trump White House as calling Donald Trump Jr. \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic\u201d for meeting during the 2016 presidential campaign with a Russian lawyer who was said to have damaging information on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.  The comments drew a furious response from President Trump, who said Bannon \u201chad lost his mind.\u201d  Their public fight ended an alliance that began when Bannon joined the Trump campaign and helped the political novice defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.  Bannon was fired by Trump in August as the president tried to bring order to feuding factions in the White House, but the two men continued to communicate and Bannon had remained an ally.  Losing his Breitbart post threatens Bannon\u2019s dream of   leading a new political movement that challenges the Republican establishment and supports his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda of tougher trade deals and immigration laws.  Bannon has also lost his talk show on SiriusXM radio, the company said on Tuesday. Sirius said in a statement its programming agreement was with Breitbart, not with Bannon.  In an effort to try to repair the damage from the book,  Bannon said his \u201ctreasonous\u201d comment was directed at a former Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who also attended the meeting at Trump Tower. The author of the book, Michael Wolff, disputed Bannon\u2019s account.  \u201cBannon died of his own sword,\u201d said Roger Stone, a long-time Trump friend. \u201cA classic example of hubris and beginning to think you are smarter than the boss.\u201d  Wolff\u2019s book, \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\u201d characterized Trump as mentally unstable, inept and unprepared for the presidency.

          "body": "WARSAW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Poland\u2019s new Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki fired several senior ministers and visited Brussels on Tuesday in an effort to patch up relations with the European Union, but said he would not unwind the country\u2019s most-contested judicial reforms.  Facing unprecedented EU legal action over accusations of backsliding on democracy by politicizing Polish courts, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party may seek to ease tensions in other areas like environmental policy or defense.  Shortly after announcing the government changes, Morawiecki left for his first face-to-face talks with officials in Brussels, the second foreign capital he has visited so far as prime minister after Budapest.  \u201cOur intention is to make the system more effective, more just, more objective,\u201d Morawiecki told a news conference defending PiS moves on the courts after nearly three hours of talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Jean-Claude Juncker.  A joint statement with the EU\u2019s executive said the dinner was \u201cfriendly\u201d and included a \u201cdetailed discussion\u201d on the rule of law issues in Poland. The two leaders would meet again \u201cwith the view to making progress by the end of February.\u201d  The Polish government changes also come as the EU embarks on negotiations on a new seven-year budget that will decide which member states get what out of the bloc\u2019s coffers - with Poland currently the biggest net recipient.  Among those who lost their posts on Tuesday was the staunchly conservative Environment Minister Jan Szyszko, who has spearheaded large-scale logging in an ancient forest that prompted action by the European Court of Justice.  Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz, a former anti-communist crusader facing criticism over delays in modernizing the army as well as conflicts with top generals, and Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski - seen as petulant and ineffective in Brussels - were also dismissed.  The reshuffle follows the appointment of former banker and finance minister Morawiecki as prime minister last month at the midpoint of the parliamentary term. PiS faces local elections in late 2018 and legislative and presidential ballots in 2019-20.  \u201cThe new (government) should help us build a sovereign Poland within a strong Europe, a Europe of homelands,\u201d Morawiecki said earlier in Warsaw in announcing the new appointments.  The feud between Brussels and Warsaw\u2019s eurosceptic government is a key element in mounting tensions between wealthier western EU members and the ex-communist east, amid a wider debate over the bloc\u2019s future provoked by Brexit.  Many Westerners are keen for EU countries to integrate further in the wake of Britain\u2019s decision to leave, but this is strongly opposed by eastern members like Poland and Hungary.  Despite the warmer tone, Morawiecki made clear he would not give up on the courts overhaul, which, together with Warsaw\u2019s refusal to host refugees, is central in the row with Brussels.  Rights groups, western EU states and Poland\u2019s political opposition say the government is undercutting the courts\u2019 independence. PiS says the reforms are needed because the country is steeped in power structures dating from the post-war communist era.  In another sign that government policy is unlikely to change, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro kept his job on Tuesday, and new rules give him powers to appoint the heads of lower-level courts as well as oversight over prosecutors.  EU states will on Feb. 27 look into whether Poland is backsliding on democracy, though the top sanction of suspending Poland\u2019s EU voting rights is unlikely to materialize, as Hungary has said it would block any such punishment.   The 27 are likely to ask Warsaw to make amends, issuing recommendations echoing those by Brussels that the PiS has so far ignored, and giving it some time to react.  France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy are among EU states saying Warsaw should be not allowed to get away with what they see as an assault on the bloc\u2019s core values.  Szyszko had attracted widespread criticism domestically over moves to lift limits on hunting as well as for allowing massive logging in areas of Poland. The dismissed health minister has struggled to contain protests by medical staff in recent months.  The outgoing, hardline defense chief has been the PiS investigator into the 2010 plane crash over Russia that killed President Lech Kaczynski - the twin brother of current party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski - and dozens of other senior Polish officials.  Kaczynski and Macierewicz believe the crash may have been caused by foul play and not pilot error, which was the official cause returned by a investigation by the previous centrist government.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump unexpectedly suggested on Tuesday that bringing back congressional \u201cearmarks,\u201d spending habits that were banished six years ago from the federal budget process,  might help an often deadlocked U.S. Congress get things done.  Known by their supporters as the \u201cgrease\u201d that made Washington\u2019s wheels turn, earmarks were funds allocated for lawmakers\u2019 pet projects that helped secure votes needed to get broader legislation passed.  \u201cMaybe all of you should start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks,\u201d Trump told lawmakers who were gathered at the White House for a meeting about immigration reform.  His surprise suggestion prompted Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, to exclaim, \u201cYeah!,\u201d while drawing objections and laughter from others in the room.  Congress resisted using earmarks routinely for decades, but they became commonplace in the 1990s and helped define Washington\u2019s image as a \u201cswamp\u201d of special interests. As a 2016 presidential candidate, Trump made \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d a campaign theme and popular slogan at his political rallies.  In the meeting on Tuesday, Trump lamented the animosity between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill.  \u201cThis system really lends itself to not getting along.\u00a0It lends itself to hostility and anger,\u201d Trump said of the difficulties of passing legislation since the practice of allowing earmarks was abandoned.   Memorable examples of the use of earmarks were a \u201cbridge to nowhere\u201d in Alaska and the conviction of Republican Congressman Duke Cunningham of California for taking millions of dollars in bribes linked to special projects.  Since the practice was banished in 2011, Congress has struggled to carry out its basic job of writing and approving annual budgets.  \u201cI hear so much about earmarks, the old earmark system, how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to put better controls because it got a little bit out of hand, but maybe that brings people together.\u00a0Because our system right now, the way it\u2019s set up, will never bring people together.\u201d   Some members of Congress have also called for reviving earmarks, but Republican Representative Mark Walker from North Carolina, who chairs a large conservative faction of the House of Representatives, drew a firm line.  \u201cI can tell you unequivocally most of us are going to have an issue with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of not bringing them back because of the temptation to abuse that process.\u201d  Trump and congressional Republicans finished 2017 with a victory by passing a landmark tax overhaul bill against the united opposition of Democrats.  While Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress, they will likely need Democrats\u2019 votes to advance other goals this year given their narrow Senate majority.   The president has begun 2018 by seeking bipartisan support for immigration measures and some Democrats attended Tuesday\u2019s  meeting.   After the November 2018 congressional elections though, if Republicans lose seats in Congress as historically happens midway through the first term of a new president, Trump will need Democrats even more to follow through on his policy agenda.

Kuczynski had promised to reveal a \u201cCabinet of reconciliation\u201d nearly two weeks ago amid an uproar over his Christmas Eve pardon for former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, whose loyalists in Congress saved Kuczynski from an impeachment bid three days prior.  A 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, Kuczynski has struggled to govern alongside a Congress controlled by Fujimori\u2019s sympathizers. At least 19 ministers have left Kuczynski\u2019s Cabinet since he took office less than two years ago, including four forced from office by Congress.  However, Fujimori\u2019s loyalists have divided the main opposition party and could help Kuczynski govern, possibly offsetting support that Kuczynski has lost from centrists and leftists.  \u201cDespite our differences, I ask you for us to join together to fight the real problems facing our nation: poverty, unequal services and opportunities, the lack of security, corruption,\u201d Kuczynski said in a brief speech after swearing nine ministers into his Cabinet.  Kuczynski promoted Deputy Energy Minister Angela Grossheim to become energy and mines minister and kept Finance Minister Claudia Cooper and Trade Minister Eduardo Ferreyros in their posts.  Cayetana Aljovin, the outgoing energy and mines minister and a former journalist and lawyer, was named the foreign minister, replacing Ricardo Luna, who had helped Peru lead regional efforts to demand democratic reforms in Venezuela.  Only three out of the eight new ministers who were sworn in on Tuesday have political experience. The rest mostly worked as career civil servants or in the private sector.  Two of the new ministers were members of the rightwing party, Apra, which is affiliated with former President Alan Garcia. Apra announced on Twitter that it was expulsing both for defying the party\u2019s decision to not form part of Kuczynski\u2019s new Cabinet.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Human antibodies made in genetically engineered cows have proved safe in an early stage clinical trial, U.S. scientists said on Wednesday, and could be developed into a treatment for the fatal viral disease, MERS.  MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, is a SARS-like viral infection first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 that has caused deadly outbreaks in the Middle East as well as sporadic cases around the world.  Despite more than five years of waves of infection, no effective treatment or vaccine has been developed against MERS, which has a 35 percent case fatality rate and has so far killed at least 740 people worldwide.  More than 80 percent of MERS cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, according to the World Health Organization.  In research published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal on Wednesday, scientists found that human antibodies called SAB-301 generated in so-called transchromosomic cattle \u2014 animals with human DNA incorporated into their genome \u2014 were safe in healthy volunteers.  The antibodies also persisted for more time than the MERS virus typically remains in the body, the study found, with antibodies still detected in bloodstream after 90 days.  This points a way ahead for the antibodies \u2014 which offer immunity against an invading infection \u2014 to be tested in further trials in people infected with MERS, the researchers said.  \u201cThis is the first study to show the safety and immune effects of a potential treatment for MERS,\u201d said John Beigel at Leidos Biomedical Research, who co-led the U.S. government-funded study. \u201cThe data from our study suggest that SAB-301 is safe, and further research into the treatment is warranted.\u201d  The idea of using human antibodies has developed in recent years in a variety of severe and emerging diseases, including flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), MERS and Ebola.   Blood plasma harvested from people whose immune systems have successfully fought the disease contains the right antibodies and can be given to other patients to help their immune systems fight the virus.  But harvesting human plasma is not always easy or swift when a new disease emerges, so scientists turned to the idea of transchromosomic cattle as a way of manufacturing specific antibodies in larger amounts.  Transchromosomic cattle have human DNA that codes for human antibodies incorporated into their genome. To make SAB-301, they were injected with a part of the MERS virus, stimulating their immune systems to produce antibodies against it. The antibodies were then extracted from the cattle\u2019s blood and purified.  \u201cThe process of creating antibody treatments by harvesting antibodies from human donors is slow and often small-scale,\u201d said Beigel. \u201cHowever, the cattle-produced antibodies could be created as soon as three months.\u201d  Editing by Catherine Evans"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Prosecutors in Los Angeles said on Tuesday they declined to pursue criminal charges against film director Roman Polanski after a woman said last fall that he molested her 43 years ago when she was 10 years old.  The Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office was investigating an accusation that Polanski, a long-time fugitive from the United States, committed lewd and lascivious acts with a child and sodomy with a minor, but did not proceed because it was beyond the statute of limitations, spokesman Greg Risling said.  The office pegged the date as Jan. 1, 1975 and declined to identify Polanski\u2019s accuser. The prosecutor opened the investigation in December.  The accuser, who identified herself online as artist Marianne Barnard, accused Polanski, now 84, in October of having molested her when he photographed her as a naked 10-year-old under an open fur coat in a photo shoot arranged by her mother.  \u201cAfter it happened, I didn\u2019t say anything to anyone,\u201d Barnard said in a post on thepetition.com, where she is seeking signatures urging that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences revoke Polanski\u2019s membership.  Polanski\u2019s lawyer, Harland Braun, said the incident never happened, adding that because police and prosecutors have stopped looking into the matter, he is pursuing his own investigation in an effort to clear his client.   \u201cWe have what we believe is a totally fictitious case against Mr. Polanski,\u201d said Braun.  Polanski in 1977 admitted to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles and spent 42 days in pre-trial custody. He fled the United States the following year, fearing a plea bargain with prosecutors would be overruled and that he would get a lengthy prison term.  In November, Swiss prosecutors dropped an investigation of him after finding that the country\u2019s statute of limitations did not allow pursuing allegations by a former German actress and model that he raped her in 1972 when she was 15 years old.  Polanski won an Academy Award in 2003 for directing \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d  (This version of the story was corrected to say accusation instead of charge in paragraph two; corrects to make clear Polanski is member of Academy not a board member, paragraph five)  Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; editing by Grant McCool"

The deal ends litigation against HarperCollins, owned by News Corp, after Canada\u2019s Competition Bureau charged that it and other publishers entered into distribution agreements with individual retailers that eliminated retail price competition on ebooks, most notably by pushing up prices that Amazon.com Inc could charge.  The agreement would restore retail price competition for ebooks in Canada, the agency said in a statement.  The Competition Bureau reached similar deals with Apple and the other publishers - Lagardere SCA\u2019s Hachette, Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH\u2019s Macmillan and CBS Corp\u2019s Simon & Schuster - almost a year ago.  The U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 declined to hear Apple\u2019s challenge to earlier rulings on the practice in the United States, forcing it to pay a $450 million settlement.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said on Tuesday it began manufacturing its premium solar roof tiles at the company\u2019s Buffalo, New York factory last month and has started surveying the homes of customers who made a deposit of $1,000 to reserve the product last year.  The solar roof, which generates electricity without the need for traditional rooftop panels, is a cornerstone of the electric vehicle maker\u2019s strategy to sell a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle under the luxury Tesla brand. Tesla unveiled the product in October 2016 as it sought to acquire solar installer SolarCity.  At that time, Tesla said the product could be rolled out as soon as the summer of 2017. In November, Tesla founder Elon Musk said the product was going through a six-month testing process, saying \u201cit just takes a little while to get this behemoth rolling.\u201d    More than a dozen Tesla employees, including Musk and Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel, had the solar roofs installed on their homes last year as part of an initial pilot program.  Tesla started taking orders for the solar roof tiles in May by asking homeowners to put down a $1,000 deposit via its web site. Tesla would not disclose how many reservations it had received for the solar roof. The product will be installed on some customer rooftops in the coming months.  The company has said its solar roofs would cost between 10 and 15 percent less than an ordinary new roof plus traditional solar panels.  Tesla is collaborating with its longstanding battery partner, Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp, to manufacture solar products at the Buffalo factory. There are about 500 employees working at the site currently, Tesla said.  The companies began production of traditional solar panels at the site last year, but they have not yet been installed on rooftops. The company said it will achieve more than 1 gigawatt of cell and module production in Buffalo, and possibly as much as double that, but gave no timeline for meeting the target.  Tesla said its primary focus is increasing production of its Model 3 sedan. The company said last week it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state lawmaker was charged with 11 counts of fraud and obstruction of justice, accused of cheating government agencies out of tens of thousands of dollars, including hurricane relief money, prosecutors said on Tuesday.  In four alleged schemes between 2012 to 2016, Assemblywoman Pamela Harris, 57, submitted falsified documents to obtain government funds for personal use, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Justice.   Harris was arraigned on Tuesday at a U.S. District Court in Brooklyn.   Her attorneys said in a statement that Harris, who represents a district in New York City\u2019s Brooklyn borough, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.  Harris, who was elected in November 2015 in a special election and returned to office in 2016, is also accused of defrauding a bankruptcy court and falsely claiming to have been forced out of her residence by Hurricane Sandy to get financial assistance, it said.  Before and during her tenure as assemblywoman, Harris allegedly went to great lengths to defraud local and federal agencies, FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said in a statement.   \u201cIn fact, at a time when many residents in her district were dealing with the horrific aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Harris was busy brewing a storm of her own,\u201d Sweeney said.   She was also accused of obstructing justice by instructing witnesses in 2017 to lie to FBI agents after becoming aware of the grand jury\u2019s investigation into her alleged crimes.  \u201cWe look forward to her day in court and an opportunity there to present the full facts,\u201d her attorneys Joel Cohen and Jerry Goldfeder said.   In one of the four alleged schemes, between August 2014 and July 2015, when Harris was executive director of a not-for-profit organization in Brooklyn, she is accused of defrauding New York City Council of $22,800 by falsely claiming the money would go toward rent for a studio art space for community use.  After submitting a forged lease agreement, Harris transferred the funds to her personal checking account and used the money to pay for personal expenses, including monthly mortgage payments, clothing and travel tickets, prosecutors said.   In another scheme, she is accused of defrauding the Federal Emergency Management Agency of nearly $25,000 in temporary housing assistance by falsely claiming that she had been forced out of her Coney Island residence by Sandy, claiming that it was uninhabitable.   If convicted on all 11 counts, Harris faces a maximum sentence of 55 years in prison.  Editing by Frank McGurty and Rosalba O'Brien"

          "body": "TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Survivors from a boat that foundered off Libya\u2019s coast on Tuesday said about 50 people who had embarked with them were feared dead, while the coastguard said the number of missing might be as high as 100.  Libyan coastguard vessels picked up nearly 300 migrants from three boats off the coast of the North African country on Tuesday, but one rubber boat was punctured and the coastguard only found 16 survivors clinging to its wreckage.    \u201cWe found the migrant boat at about 10 o\u2019clock this morning, it had sunk and we found 16 migrants. The rest were all missing and unfortunately we didn\u2019t find any bodies or (other) survivors,\u201d said Nasr al-Qamoudi, a coastguard commander.  Several of the survivors, who were brought back to a naval base in Tripoli, said there were originally about 70 people on board the boat when it set off near the town of Khoms, east of the capital. A coastguard statement later said that \u201cat least 90-100\u201d migrants were missing.  The two other migrant boats were found off Zawiya, west of Tripoli.  A Nigerian woman who had been on board the boat that sank, Zainab Abdesalam, told Reuters the migrants had waited several hours to be rescued and that the survivors were extremely weak.   \u201cI feel so disappointed because I could not make it to where I want to go,\u201d she said, sobbing. \u201cI feel so disappointed and I don\u2019t want to go to prison.\u201d   Libya is the most common departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa by sea. More than 600,000 have crossed the central Mediterranean in the past four years, generally travelling in flimsy inflatable craft provided by smugglers that often break down or puncture.  Under heavy pressure from Italy, some Libyan armed factions have blocked smuggling since last summer. Libya\u2019s Italian-backed coastguard has also stepped up interceptions, returning migrants to Libya where they are detained and often reenter smuggling networks.  There has been a surge in attempted crossings in recent days, with dozens more migrants feared to have drowned over the weekend.   The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated that 2,832 migrants died last year trying to reach Italy from North Africa, down from 4,581 in 2016. Some 119,310 people made it alive to Italy in 2017 against 181,436 the year before.  Reporting by Hani Amara; Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Gareth Jones and James Dalgleish"

          "title": "EXPLAINER-Facts on the arrest of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo",
          "body": "(Adds more details)  YANGON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Myanmar has accused Reuters reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, of breaching the country\u2019s Official Secrets Act, a little-used law from colonial rule.  It will be their second appearance in court and the prosecutor could announce the charges sought against them.  Following is some information about the case.  Wa Lone\u2019s first job in journalism was with the People\u2019s Age journal. In 2014, he joined the English-language Myanmar Times, covering the 2015 election that swept Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to power. Wa Lone wrote a children\u2019s book and co-founded a charity that promotes tolerance between different ethnic groups and helps orphans.  Wa Lone joined Reuters in 2016 and made his mark with reports on sensitive subjects. His work on the crisis that erupted in Rakhine State in October 2016 won him a joint honourable mention from the Society of Publishers in Asia in its annual awards. He returned to the region last year, after attacks by Rohingya Muslim militants triggered a crackdown by the army and an exodus to Bangladesh of some 650,000 Rohingya.  Wa Lone has also covered stories ranging from economic development and infrastructure projects to local elections and health issues.  Kyaw Soe Oo is an ethnic Rakhine Buddhist who grew up in the state capital, Sittwe. He started his reporting career with the online Rakhine Development News and later worked at the Root Investigative Agency.  Friends say Kyaw Soe Oo avoided becoming caught up in the tension between Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims but the conflict drew him into journalism.  He has been with Reuters since September last year.  Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested on Dec. 12, after they were invited to meet police for dinner in Yangon, on suspicion of violating the Official Secrets Act.  The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying they were \u201carrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces\u201d.  The ministry said they had \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media\u201d.  The government only announced the arrest of the reporters some 24 hours after they were detained and the two were held at an undisclosed location without contact with families or lawyers for two weeks.  They have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents by two policemen who they met at the restaurant for the first time. They did not read the documents before they were arrested, the relatives said.  Police have not commented on that account. Reuters has been unable to ask Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo about the circumstances of their arrest.  The government has said two police officers were also arrested and charged under the Official Secrets Act. According to the reporters, the police arrested were not those who provided the documents. The government has given no further information on the police arrested.  The Official Secrets Act dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.  Legal experts say prosecutions under it have been rare.  The most well-documented recent case was in 2014, when the Unity Journal weekly published an article it said exposed a secret military chemical weapons factory.  Police arrested the newspaper\u2019s chief executive and four journalists. A civilian court sentenced them to 10 years in prison with hard labour - later reduced to seven years. The case was widely seen as a warning that military affairs remained off-limits even though direct military rule had ended and censorship had been lifted.  The five were released under an amnesty in April 2016, soon after Suu Kyi\u2019s party came to power.  Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were held incommunicado by the police for two weeks before appearing in court on Dec. 27, when they were remanded for another two weeks. During the hearing, they were allowed to meet relatives and a lawyer for the first time since being arrested.  Only their lawyer and relatives, along with police and government lawyers, were allowed into the court. The reporters said they had not been mistreated in custody.  Government officials from some of the world\u2019s major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for the release of the journalists.  Surakiart Sathirathai, a former Thai foreign minister and the head of a new international advisory panel on the Rohingya crisis, also expressed concern at the arrest of the reporters and said he hoped the case did not lead to broader restrictions on the international media.  Several non-governmental and journalist organisations have called the arrests an attack on the freedom of the press. (Writing by Robert Birsel; Editing by Alex Richardson)"

          "body": "YANGON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Two Reuters journalists detained in Myanmar are due to appear in court on Wednesday, when prosecutors could request that charges be filed against them over an accusation they broke the country\u2019s Official Secrets Act.  Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where - according to U.N. estimates - about 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.  The reporters were detained on Dec. 12 after they had been invited to meet police officers over dinner.  The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying they were \u201carrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces\u201d.  The ministry said they \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media\u201d and faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act.

Government officials from some of the world\u2019s major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top United Nations officials, have called for the release of the reporters.  Former U.S. President Bill Clinton also urged that they be freed immediately.  \u201cA free press is critical to a free society - the detention of journalists anywhere is unacceptable. The Reuters journalists being held in Myanmar should be released immediately,\u201d Clinton said in a Twitter post on Monday.  Clinton was U.S. president for much of the 1990s when the United States pressed Myanmar\u2019s then military rulers to release democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi from years of house arrest.  Suu Kyi won a 2015 election and formed a government in early 2016, although she is barred by the constitution from becoming president.  She has made no public comment on the detention of the two Reuters reporters. The government has denied that their arrests represent an attack on press freedom and Suu Kyi\u2019s spokesman has said the case would be handled according to the law.  A government spokesman was not available for comment on Clinton\u2019s Twitter post.  Human rights group Amnesty International also called for the immediate release of the two and for freedom of speech to be respected.  \u201cThese arrests have not happened in a vacuum, but come as authorities are increasingly restricting independent media,\u201d Amnesty International said in a statement.  \u201cJournalists and media outlets, in particular those who report on \u2018sensitive topics\u2019, are living with the constant fear of harassment, intimidation or arrest. This clampdown on freedom of speech must end.\u201d (Writing by Robert Birsel; Editing by Alex Richardson)"

          "body": "EDINBURGH (Reuters) - British pessimism on the economic consequences of leaving the European Union is growing, but Britons have not broadly changed their minds about how they voted, Britain\u2019s leading pollster John Curtice said on Tuesday.  British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to deliver a new trading relationship with the EU with her authority diminished by party infighting, the resignation of key allies, a fractious parliament, a divided electorate and a tight timetable before the March 2019 Brexit deadline.  Research carried out in October by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen), where Curtice is senior research fellow, found Britons increasingly critical of the UK government\u2019s handling of Brexit.   \u201cAlthough voters ... blame the government, blame the EU, \u2018Leave\u2019 voters for the most part have not changed their minds about their decision,\u201d Curtice, who is also a professor of politics at Strathclyde University, told a presentation in the Scottish capital. \u201c\u2018Leave\u2019 voters are saying the government is mucking up, not that the decision we made (to leave the EU) was wrong.\u201d  The NatCen poll found 52 percent of Britons thought the economy would be worse off after Brexit, versus 46 percent in a similar poll last February. That compared with 58 percent of Scots, polled separately, unchanged from February.  As for Scotland, which voted to stay in the EU, Brexit is not a catalyst for Scottish independence from the UK but it has not dampened separatist fervor either, the poll found. Support for secession is at about 44 percent versus 45 percent in a 2014 independence referendum.  The poll also showed 52 percent of Britons now expect a \u201cbad deal\u201d versus 55 percent of Scots. That compares with 37 percent of Britons last February.  NatCen also found that support for a different Scottish immigration policy from the rest of the UK after Brexit, as favored by the Scottish government, does not have majority support either and most Scots want the same immigration policy nationwide.  In Britain as a whole, 61 percent of those polled thought Brexit had been badly handled by the UK government, up from 41 percent in February and versus 69 percent in Scotland.  ScotCen polled 859 people, all of whom had been interviewed as part of the 2015 or 2016 Scottish Social Attitudes survey, which is carried out face to face.

          "body": "(Reuters) - SandRidge Energy Inc\u2019s (SD.N) biggest shareholder, Carl Icahn, called on Tuesday for the replacement of two directors and the removal of a poison pill barring individual shareholders from accumulating more than 10 percent of the U.S. shale producer\u2019s stock.  The move was the latest in the billionaire investor\u2019s dispute with the Oklahoma City-based oil and gas firm, after he successfully lobbied the company\u2019s board last month to abandon a proposed $746 million purchase of rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc (BCEI.N).  Icahn said in a letter to SandRidge Chairman John Genova that he wanted to nominate one new director, while the other would be determined by other large shareholders. Icahn did not specify which board members he would like removed, nor did he explain why he was not pushing for the entire five-person board to be replaced. bit.ly/2maIfz6  Icahn did not respond to a request to comment but he lashed out in his letter at James Bennett, SandRidge\u2019s chief executive and director, for his leadership.   \u201cYour apparent disregard for any semblance of accountability to the owners of SandRidge reminds me of the medieval belief in the divine right of kings,\u201d Icahn wrote.  SandRidge said it expects to meet next week with Icahn and other large investors in the company, adding that it values \u201cconstructive shareholder dialogue.\u201d It defended the poison pill, saying it does not bar shareholders from communicating with one another as long they did not form a group.  SandRidge, which emerged from bankruptcy last year, had billed the Bonanza Creek deal as a key growth opportunity in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado.  Icahn, SandRidge\u2019s largest shareholder with a 13.5 percent stake in the company, had called the deal \u201cvalue-destroying,\u201d citing the large amount of stock the company would have had to issue to fund it.   Icahn demanded the company change its bylaws so that large transactions require approval from four of the five board members, rather than a simple majority and to withdraw or amend the poison pill.  SandRidge shares rose three cents to $21.09 on Tuesday.   Analysts at Coker Palmer Institutional said the muted share reaction was due to a recent run-up and the lack of direction beyond the proposed board shake-up in Icahn\u2019s letter.   Icahn has not always been successful in agitating for change at energy companies. In 2016, his hand-picked director at Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) resigned in what was widely seen as a tacit admission that the investor\u2019s turnaround strategy was not working fast enough.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats said on Tuesday they will force a vote later this year on the U.S. Federal Communications Commission\u2019s reversal of landmark Obama administration net neutrality rules and will try to make it a key issue in the 2018 congressional elections.  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the issue will be a major motivating factor for young voters the party is courting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let everyone know where we stand and they stand,\u201d Schumer said at a Capitol Hill news conference in Washington.  Democrats picked up a key vote when Republican Senator Susan Collins said on Tuesday she would back the effort to overturn the FCC\u2019s recent move. \u201cShe believes that a careful, deliberative process involving experts and the public is warranted to ensure that consumers have strong protections that guarantee consumer choice, free markets, and continued growth,\u201d a spokeswoman for Collins said.  The FCC voted in December along party lines to reverse rules introduced in 2015 that barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes. A group of state attorneys general immediately vowed to sue.  A trade group representing major tech companies including Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc said last week it will support legal challenges to the reversal.   The vote in December marked a victory for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc and hands them power over what content consumers can access over the internet. It was the biggest win for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations.  Senate Democrats on Tuesday called the FCC decision \u201cun-American\u201d and an \u201call-out assault on consumers.\u201d  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, backs the FCC repeal. A reversal of the FCC vote would need the approval of the Senate, U.S. House and President Donald Trump. Trump also backed the FCC action, the White House said last month.  The FCC order grants internet providers sweeping new powers to block, throttle or discriminate among internet content, but requires public disclosure of those practices. Internet providers have vowed not to change how consumers obtain online content.  Democrats say net neutrality is essential to protect consumers, while Republicans say the rules hindered investment by providers and were not needed.  Democratic Senator Ed Markey said on Tuesday he had 39 co-sponsors to force a vote, but it is not clear when the vote will occur since the new rules will not take effect for at least another three months. \u201cThere will be a political price to pay for those who are on the wrong side of history,\u201d Markey said.  Republicans control the Senate with 51 votes out of the 100-member body, so Democrats would need at least one more Republican to back overturning the FCC action.  Senator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, said the issue was resonating with teenagers and college students. \u201cPeople are mobilizing across the country to save the free and open internet,\u201d he said.

          "body": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran has foiled attempts by its foreign enemies to turn legitimate protests into an insurgency to overthrow the Islamic Republic, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday.  Comments on his Twitter feed and in Iranian media underscored the establishment\u2019s confidence that it has extinguished the unrest that spread to more than 80 cities in which at least 22 people died since late December.  \u201cOnce again, the nation tells the U.S., Britain, and those who seek to overthrow the Islamic Republic of Iran from abroad that \u2018you\u2019ve failed, and you will fail in the future, too\u2019,\u201d Khamenei tweeted.  The Revolutionary Guards, the military force loyal to Khamenei, said on Sunday security forces had put an end to the unrest that it also said had been whipped up by foreign enemies.   At least 1,000 people have been arrested in the biggest anti-government protests for nearly a decade, with the judiciary saying ringleaders could face the death penalty.  A judiciary official said on Tuesday that a detainee in Arak, a town about 200 km (124 miles) south of Tehran, committed suicide, according to Mizan, the website of the Iranian judiciary.   On Monday, a separate judiciary official announced that a detainee had committed suicide in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison.  The reports have raised concerns among human rights activists and some Iranian politicians that detainees may have been killed by security forces while in custody.  \u201cI warn the president and security and judiciary officials to prevent the occurrence of a second Kahrizak,\u201d Mahmoud Sadeghi, a parliamentarian, tweeted on Monday. The Kahrizak prison gained notoriety when a handful of detainees were tortured and killed at the site after unrest in 2009.  Khamenei said U.S. President Donald Trump was grandstanding when he tweeted that protesters were trying \u201cto take back their corrupt government\u201d, promising \u201cgreat support from the United States at the appropriate time!\u201d  The Iranian leader tweeted: \u201c... this man who sits at the head of the White House - although, he seems to be a very unstable man - he must realize that these extreme and psychotic episodes won\u2019t be left without a response.\u201d  The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly, by 415-2, on Wednesday for a resolution supporting the peaceful protests in Iran, criticizing the Iranian government\u2019s response and urging targeted sanctions in response to what lawmakers termed Tehran\u2019s crackdown.  As well as Washington and London, Khamenei blamed the violence on Israel, exiled dissident group People\u2019s Mujahedin of Iran and \u201ca wealthy government\u201d in the Gulf, a probable reference to Iran\u2019s regional rival, Saudi Arabia.  In a rare public appearance, the head of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad said the protests were due to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s failure to improve people\u2019s economic or social circumstances, but he said they were unlikely to overthrow the establishment.  \u201cIn Iran too, we have eyes and ears,\u201d Yossi Cohen told a Finance Ministry conference in Jerusalem.  \u201cOne shouldn\u2019t develop high hopes, though I would be happy to see a meaningful revolution,\u201d he added.  Khamenei has called the protests - which were initially about the economy but soon turned political - \u201cplaying with fireworks\u201d, but he said citizens had a right to air legitimate concerns, a rare concession by a leader who usually voices clear support for security crackdowns.  \u201cThese concerns must be addressed. We must listen, we must hear. We must provide answers within our means,\u201d Khamenei was quoted as saying, hinting that not only the government of Rouhani, but his own clerical leadership must also respond.   \u201cI am also responsible. All of us must follow up,\u201d Khamenei said.

Settlements are one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, frozen since 2014.  Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Most countries consider as illegal the Israeli settlements built in the territory which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.  Israel disputes that its settlements are illegal and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians.    Israeli authorities were due to approve on Wednesday the construction of 1,285 housing units to be built in 2018 and advance planning for 2,500 others in about 20 different settlements, Lieberman said in a statement.  There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian officials. The Palestinians say Israeli settlements in the West bank, a key issue in peace talks, deny them a viable contiguous state.   U.S.-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014 and a bid by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to restart them have shown little sign of progress.  Asked about the construction plans, a U.S. State Department official said there had been no change in policy on settlements and the Israeli government had made clear that going forward \u201cits intent is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes the President\u2019s concerns into consideration.\u201d  \u201cThe United States welcomes this.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday, with U.S. crude touching its highest since December 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for an eighth week in a row.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia are keeping supply limits in place in 2018, a second year of restraint, to reduce a price-denting glut of oil held in inventories.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $1.23, or 2 percent, to settle at $62.96 a barrel after touching its highest since December 2014 at $63.24.  Brent crude ended the session up $1.04, or 1.5 percent, at $68.82 per barrel after hitting a session high of $69.08, its highest since May 2015. Both contracts had their strongest close since December 2014.  Prices extended gains in post-settlement trade after industry group the American Petroleum Institute said crude inventories fell by 11.2 million barrels in the week to Jan. 5 to 416.6 million, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for a decrease of 3.9 million barrels. [API/S]  If confirmed by U.S. government data at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday, the draw will be the largest since Sept. 2, 2016. U.S. stockpiles fell by 14.5 million barrels during that week.  \u201cYou\u2019re so long this market at this point, you could certainly get more interest at these levels,\u201d said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.  \u201cThis is a little more confirmation of what speculators have been looking for and after tomorrow\u2019s (U.S. government inventory) report, we\u2019ll see if they look to do some profit-taking.\u201d  OPEC is cutting output by even more than it promised and the restraint is reducing oil stocks globally, a trend most visible in the United States, the world\u2019s largest and most transparent oil market. [OPEC/O]   \u201cWe expect oil demand growth to outpace non-OPEC supply growth in both 2018 and 2019,\u201d Standard Chartered analysts said in a note.  \u201cIn our view, the back of the Brent and WTI curves are both still underpriced. We do not think that prices below $65 per barrel are sustainable into the medium term.\u201d   Many producers, still suffering from a 2014 price collapse, are enjoying the rally, although they are wary it will spur rival supply sources. Iran said OPEC members were not keen on increased prices.  The rise in prices is expected to drive gains in U.S. production during 2018, offsetting curbs by others.   U.S. crude oil production is expected to surpass 10 million barrels per day (bpd) next month, en route to an all-time record months ahead of previous forecasts, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Tuesday.  Production was expected to rise to an average 10.04 million bpd during the first quarter of this year.  Some analysts have said the rise in U.S. shale oil production could discourage OPEC and Russia to maintain their deal to curb supply until the end of the year for fears of losing market share.  \u201cI am now on the lookout for bearish technical patterns to emerge on oil prices as I believe they will struggle to go north of $65-$75 per barrel given the above fundamental consideration,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst for Forex.com.  \u201cIf WTI were to go back below the 2017 high of $60.48, which was hit late in the year, and the 2018\u2019s opening price of $60.09, then the technical outlook would turn bearish on oil. But for now, the bullish trend remains intact as prices remain above key supports.\u201d  Additional reporting by Alex Lawler in London, Henning Gloystein in Singapore; editing by David Gregorio and Diane Craft"

          "title": "GM races to build a formula for profitable electric cars",
          "body": "DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra has made a bold promise to investors that the Detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021.  What Barra has not explained in detail is how GM intends to do what, so far, no major automaker has done.  The answer is a big bet on combining proprietary battery technology, a low-cost, flexible vehicle design and high-volume production mainly in China, according to six current and former GM and supplier executives and six industry experts interviewed by Reuters.   If GM can meet Barra\u2019s ambitious profitability target, then it will house two different businesses by the mid-2020s: A traditional focus in North America on trucks, sport utility vehicles and cars fueled with petroleum, and a global electric car company centered in China, branching into pay-per-use services such as robotaxis.    Barra\u2019s promise to turn a profit is a bold claim in a market segment that has been driven more by government policy than consumer demand, and where Tesla Inc - the world\u2019s largest electric-vehicle manufacturer - is burning through more than $1 billion in cash each quarter selling premium-priced vehicles.  Barra and GM have invested heavily in the electrification strategy, and worked during the past year to persuade investors that GM can compete with Tesla by building on the success of the automaker\u2019s latest electric vehicle, the Chevrolet Bolt EV, and cutting costs along the way.   A key element of the plan, according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s strategy, is slashing the amount of cobalt in GM\u2019s new EMC 1.0 battery system. The price of cobalt \u2013  the single most costly ingredient in current lithium-ion battery cells - has soared in the past two years in expectation of a surge in demand from automakers. Cobalt prices hit a record high this month on the London Metal Exchange.  GM\u2019s new battery design increases the amount of nickel, which enables batteries to store and produce more energy, these people told Reuters.  GM engineers are also working on other design and technological advances, according to executives and company patent filings, including more efficient packaging of batteries in vehicles and improved systems for managing energy flow and cooling the battery cells.   Without providing details, GM has said it expects these changes to cut the cost of battery cells by more than 30 percent, from $145 per kilowatt-hour to less than $100 by 2021.   Battery experts said the full cost of a GM battery pack, such as the one used now in the Bolt EV, is $10,000-$12,000, or nearly one-third of the car\u2019s $36,000 sticker price.  By 2021, however, that price could drop to $6,000, according to consultant Jon Bereisa, a former GM engineering director who helped develop the Chevrolet Volt hybrid and spearheaded much of the automaker\u2019s early lithium-ion battery development.  With improvements in battery chemistry and packaging, Bereisa said, the next-generation Bolt \u201ccould deliver a 45-percent increase in range for about the same (battery) pack cost, or the same range at 45 percent less pack cost.\u201d  Pam Fletcher, vice president in charge of GM\u2019s global electric vehicle programs, and other GM executives would not comment on specifics of the new battery system, which is slated to be introduced in 2020-2021.   To be sure, electric vehicles account for only a small fraction of global auto sales. Like other manufacturers, GM is banking not only on reducing its own costs and improving vehicle performance, but also on increased demand driven by higher government-mandated electric vehicle quotas in China that are intended to help reduce pollution and the country\u2019s dependence on petroleum.  In addition to improving battery and vehicle design and performance, GM is working with Chinese partner SAIC to reduce the cost of assembling electric cars. Sources said GM and SAIC are designing dedicated electric vehicle factories in China that are far smaller, less complex and more efficient than a conventional car plant.      GM has more capital for electric vehicle development because of Barra\u2019s decisions to sell money-losing European operations, exit other unprofitable markets and invest in a new generation of highly profitable, petroleum-fueled large pickup trucks, launching later in 2018.        The automaker now has more than 1,700 engineers, designers and researchers working on batteries and electric vehicles, many of them at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, where the company opened a dedicated battery research center in 2009, a week after it filed for bankruptcy reorganization.   Automotive experts say GM\u2019s battery and EV group is one of the largest in the world, rivaled only by Toyota Motor Corp in Japan and Daimler AG in Germany.   Toyota has patented more battery technology in recent years than GM, although its focus has been mainly the Prius family of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, rather than on pure battery-powered cars like GM\u2019s Bolt EV.   GM was issued 661 U.S. patents on battery technology from 2010 through 2015, the latest that such data is available from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, trailing only Toyota\u2019s 762 battery patents among global automakers.   For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2CHPWnx  In addition to the battery work, GM engineers are developing a new dedicated \u201cplug and play\u201d structure for its next-generation electric vehicles that is flexible and modular, meaning it will be able to accommodate battery systems of different sizes, as well as hydrogen fuel cells, one of the sources said.  In an interview, Mark Reuss, head of global product development, said GM\u2019s strategy to reduce battery cost is not tied to a single improvement such as a change in battery chemistry, but rather a series of continuous enhancements in battery technology and packaging.  \u201cThere are no silver bullets here,\u201d Reuss said. GM also has not solved all the problems required to achieve its goal, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018product development\u2019 for a reason,\u201d he said.  The most recent developments and enhancements in battery technology have not been made public, according to GM\u2019s Fletcher.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that we choose not to patent because we don\u2019t want to make it visible\u201d before the new technology goes into production, Fletcher told Reuters.  GM\u2019s patent history since 2010 shows a focus on improvements in battery technology, packaging and processing, some of them designed to help boost the battery\u2019s energy and extend vehicle range between charges, according to company filings.  GM jointly developed its current battery know-how with Korea\u2019s LG Group, which makes batteries and electronic components for the Bolt. Introduced in October 2016, Bolt was the first mass-produced electric vehicle to go more than 200 miles between charges, and sell at a sticker price of under $40,000. GM sold 23,297 Bolts in 2017.   Tesla reported producing just 1,770 of its $35,000 Model 3 sedans in 2017, well short of the company\u2019s original targets.   The launch of the Bolt and its warm reception by reviewers, customers and investors was a watershed event for Barra and GM\u2019s top management.  \u201cIt was a \u2018holy shit\u2019 moment that made us rethink what might be possible,\u201d said one GM insider.

Iran said OPEC members were not keen on increased prices.  The rise in prices is expected to drive gains in U.S. production during 2018, offsetting curbs by others.   U.S. crude oil production is expected to surpass 10 million barrels per day (bpd) next month, en route to an all-time record months ahead of previous forecasts, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Tuesday.  Production was expected to rise to an average 10.04 million bpd during the first quarter of this year.  Some analysts have said the rise in U.S. shale oil production could discourage OPEC and Russia to maintain their deal to curb supply until the end of the year for fears of losing market share.  \u201cI am now on the lookout for bearish technical patterns to emerge on oil prices as I believe they will struggle to go north of $65-$75 per barrel given the above fundamental consideration,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst for Forex.com.  \u201cIf WTI were to go back below the 2017 high of $60.48, which was hit late in the year, and the 2018\u2019s opening price of $60.09, then the technical outlook would turn bearish on oil. But for now, the bullish trend remains intact as prices remain above key supports.\u201d  Additional reporting by Alex Lawler in London, Henning Gloystein in Singapore; editing by David Gregorio and Diane Craft"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s major indexes extended the New Year rally to close at record levels on Tuesday on investor optimism ahead of quarterly earnings reports and hopes for easing tensions with North Korea.  Defensive S&P sectors - utilities, real estate and telecommunications - were out of favor, while bank stocks were boosted by rising U.S. 10-year Treasury yields. Healthcare stocks rose with the sector in focus on the second day of an industry conference.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq registered their sixth closing record highs in a row. The Dow also ended at record levels after it had snapped a 3-day run of closing highs in Monday\u2019s session.  Some investors were reassured that North and South Korea held their first talks in more than two years, which Washington described as a good first step in solving the North\u2019s nuclear missile program crisis. Pyongyang said it would not discuss weapons that were aimed only at the United States.  \u201cThe diplomacy taking place between North Korea and South Korea might circumvent some type of military action. Anything that would de-risk the peninsula would be viewed favorably by investors,\u201d said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.8 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,385.8, the S&P 500 gained 3.58 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,751.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.19 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,163.58.  Profits for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an 8-percent increase a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  \u201cThere will be some noise there with tax adjustments, but the forward-looking comments ought to be pretty positive. Investors are buying into that,\u201d said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  The S&P financial sector ended 0.8 percent higher after yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a 10-month high after the Bank of Japan said it will trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds.  Interest-rate sensitive utilities and real estate sectors ended 1 percent lower while the telecommunications sector fell 1.8 percent.  While investors are hopeful about global economic growth and tax-cut led gains for corporate earnings, they are anxious about whether the tax-overhaul could overheat inflation and lead to a sharper than expected rise in interest rates.  After a lukewarm December jobs report, signs of a pickup in inflation could come in the monthly consumer price report due on Friday, on the same day that big U.S. banks are set to kick off the fourth-quarter earnings season.  The S&P healthcare sector closed 1 percent higher,  boosted by a 1.6-percent rise in Johnson & Johnson, a 5-percent gain in Gilead and a 8.3-percent jump in Boston Scientific shares.  Chip stocks dragged on the technology sector, which fell 0.3 percent. Intel fell 2.5 percent after Microsoft Corp said computers with older Intel chips slowed noticeably after it released security patches.         Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 131 new highs and 24 new lows.    Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.77 billion shares, above the 6.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

          "body": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria\u2019s political parties must select their candidates for the country\u2019s 2019 presidential election between Aug. 18 and Oct. 7 this year, the electoral commission said on Tuesday in a timetable of the polling process.  Presidential and parliamentary elections will be held on Feb. 16, 2019, marking the end of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s first term. Buhari has not said if he will seek re-election.  In addition to outlining the deadline to select candidates, the timetable published by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) stated that official campaigns for the presidential parliamentary elections would begin on Nov. 18.   \u201cThe Commission wishes to assure Nigerians that we are determined to strictly adhere to the timetable and schedule of activities,\u201d INEC said in a statement.   Buhari, 75, took office in May 2015 after winning elections that year following a campaign in which he vowed to crack down on endemic corruption and crush the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency in the northeast.  Although the president has not said whether he will run in the next election, the minister of communications last week said he would chair a group to support the re-election of Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.  It is common practice for the campaign to re-elect a Nigerian president to begin with such support groups before the incumbent declares an intention to run again.   Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and key Buhari ally, quit the ruling All Progressives Congress and said he was prepared to run in 2019. He joined the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party last month.  Reporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Leslie Adler"

          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico\u2019s annual inflation rate climbed to a 16-1/2 year high in 2017, piling pressure on the central bank and its new governor to act again next month to rein in inflation after hiking borrowing costs at the December monetary policy meeting.  Inflation stood at 6.77 percent in the year to December, the highest annual rate since the 12 months to May 2001, according to data published on Tuesday by the national statistics agency.  That was slightly higher than a Reuters poll of economists that expected inflation at year-end to accelerate to 6.75 percent from 6.63 percent in November.  Inflation surged after the liberalization of gasoline prices at the start of last year, though governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon said on Sunday the rate should slow in January as that factor fades from the consumer price index.  The rise in inflation for Latin America\u2019s second-biggest economy \u201cwill probably lead to further calls for Banxico to raise rates again,\u201d at its next policy meeting, Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at London-based Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.

The volatile peso, a likely deterioration of inflation expectations, and risks to the economy associated with the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as well as a presidential election in Mexico this year make a rate hike next month \u201ca significant probability,\u201d said Goldman Sachs economist Alberto Ramos.

Consumer prices MXINFL=ECI rose 0.59 percent in December, a six-year high for that month, according to non-seasonally adjusted figures.  The core index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.42 percent during the month MXCPIX=ECI.  Mexico\u2019s central bank targets inflation of 3 percent.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The producer of an upcoming American TV series about the murder of designer Gianni Versace has defended the show from criticism, saying the family is treated \u201cwith respect and kindness.\u201d  The Versace company said in a statement issued in Italy on Monday that the series was \u201can act of fiction\u201d given that it was based on Maureen Orth\u2019s 1999 book \u201cVulgar Favors.\u201d It said it \u201cdid not authorize and was not involved in the television series.\u201d  \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\u201d dramatizes the violent death of Versace in a shooting at his Miami mansion in 1997.  Executive producer Ryan Murphy told Hollywood trade publication Variety at a Los Angeles event that Versace\u2019s sister, Donatella, sent actress Penelope Cruz flowers when Cruz was representing the series at the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday.  Edgar Ramirez plays Gianni Versace and Cruz plays Donatella Versace in the nine-part series by Twenty-First Century Fox Inc\u2019s FX cable network that will start broadcasting on Jan. 17. Donatella is artistic director and vice president of the privately held fashion company.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if she (Donatella) is going to watch the show, but if she did I think that she would see that we treat her and her family with respect and kindness,\u201d Murphy told Variety on Tuesday night.  \u201cShe really is a feminist role model in my book, because she had to step into an impossible situation, which she did with grace and understanding. I think that she really loves Penelope and knows that Penelope would never do anything to represent her in a negative light,\u201d Murphy said.  Screenwriter Tom Rob Smith said the series aimed to be truthful in its spirit, even if it gets some details wrong.  \u201cThe show is full of love for him (Versace),\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are points where (the family) could correct some of the smaller details, but I think the bigger picture is that this is a figure that we\u2019re celebrating and a figure that we all fell in love with.\u201d  Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Lisa Shumaker"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields hit a 10-month high on Tuesday  after the Bank of Japan tweaked its bond-buying program, while stocks in world indexes continued their flying start to the year.  U.S. oil touched its highest since late 2014, while the yen hit a six-day high following the Bank of Japan\u2019s announcement that it will trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds.  The move raised speculation Japan\u2019s central bank may wind down its monetary stimulus this year.  \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily see this as a signal of impending policy change, but investors are very sensitive to the overall monetary policy backdrop, especially out of the major central banks,\u201d said John Briggs, head of Americas strategy at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.  The U.S. 10-year note yielded 2.546 percent, the highest since March 15, while the 3-year note yield, which is sensitive to traders\u2019 views on Fed policy, was 2.074 percent, its highest since the instrument was reissued in 2007.  Stocks extended their record run. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have hit records every trading day of the new year, or the past six sessions, providing optimism on the outlook for the rest of the year. The S&P 500 is up 2.9 percent since Dec. 31.  U.S. stock investors remain upbeat about fourth-quarter earnings season, which begins on Friday with results from JPMorgan Chase, with the focus expected to be on any comments related to the just-approved U.S. tax overhaul that includes hefty corporate tax cuts.  Bank stocks were boosted on Tuesday by rising U.S. Treasury 10-year yields. The S&P financial index was up 0.7 percent.  \u201cWe\u2019re continuing the rally. Earnings season starts this Friday, and we\u2019ll probably have another decent season. There will be some noise there with tax adjustments, but the forward-looking comments ought to be pretty positive. Investors are buying into that,\u201d said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  \u201cYou have low inflation and rising earnings. That\u2019s a good environment for stocks, so we\u2019ve seen all of the indexes moving higher, continuing what we\u2019ve had this year,\u201d he said.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.8 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,385.8, the S&P 500 gained 3.58 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,751.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.19 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,163.58.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.48 percent and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.14 percent.  Also, in foreign exchange market, the dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies and hit an 11-day peak, as its decline last week to the lowest in more than three months continued to draw bargain hunters.  The dollar index rose 0.16 percent, with the euro down 0.26 percent to $1.1934.  The Japanese yen strengthened 0.40 percent versus the greenback at 112.64 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3538, down 0.21 percent on the day.  Oil prices rose, with U.S. prices touching their highest since December 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for an eighth week.  U.S. crude rose $1.23, or 2 percent, to settle at $62.96 a barrel after touching its highest since December 2014 at $63.24. Brent crude ended the session up $1.04, or 1.5 percent, at $68.82.

The move raised speculation Japan\u2019s central bank may wind down its monetary stimulus this year.  \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily see this as a signal of impending policy change, but investors are very sensitive to the overall monetary policy backdrop, especially out of the major central banks,\u201d said John Briggs, head of Americas strategy at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.  The U.S. 10-year note yielded 2.546 percent, the highest since March 15, while the 3-year note yield, which is sensitive to traders\u2019 views on Fed policy, was 2.074 percent, its highest since the instrument was reissued in 2007.  Stocks extended their record run. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have hit records every trading day of the new year, or the past six sessions, providing optimism on the outlook for the rest of the year. The S&P 500 is up 2.9 percent since Dec. 31.  U.S. stock investors remain upbeat about fourth-quarter earnings season, which begins on Friday with results from JPMorgan Chase, with the focus expected to be on any comments related to the just-approved U.S. tax overhaul that includes hefty corporate tax cuts.  Bank stocks were boosted on Tuesday by rising U.S. Treasury 10-year yields. The S&P financial index was up 0.7 percent.  \u201cWe\u2019re continuing the rally. Earnings season starts this Friday, and we\u2019ll probably have another decent season. There will be some noise there with tax adjustments, but the forward-looking comments ought to be pretty positive. Investors are buying into that,\u201d said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  \u201cYou have low inflation and rising earnings. That\u2019s a good environment for stocks, so we\u2019ve seen all of the indexes moving higher, continuing what we\u2019ve had this year,\u201d he said.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.8 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,385.8, the S&P 500 gained 3.58 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,751.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.19 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,163.58.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.48 percent and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.14 percent.  Also, in foreign exchange market, the dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies and hit an 11-day peak, as its decline last week to the lowest in more than three months continued to draw bargain hunters.  The dollar index rose 0.16 percent, with the euro down 0.26 percent to $1.1934.  The Japanese yen strengthened 0.40 percent versus the greenback at 112.64 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3538, down 0.21 percent on the day.  Oil prices rose, with U.S. prices touching their highest since December 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for an eighth week.  U.S. crude rose $1.23, or 2 percent, to settle at $62.96 a barrel after touching its highest since December 2014 at $63.24. Brent crude ended the session up $1.04, or 1.5 percent, at $68.82.

          "body": "BOSTON (Reuters) - A Massachusetts hedge fund manager pleaded guilty on Tuesday after prosecutors accused him of misusing millions of dollars from investors to pay for lavish personal expenses like a sports car and to engage in a Ponzi-like scheme.  Yasuna Murakami, who managed Cambridge, Massachusetts-based MC2 Capital Management LLC and another investment advisory firm, pleaded guilty in federal court in Boston to one count of wire fraud.  Murakami was arrested last May. Under a plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence of eight years and one month in prison. Murakami, 44, is scheduled to be sentenced on April 9.  Murakami declined to comment outside after a court hearing. In court, he said that he was engaged in counseling for stress, anxiety and personal issues, matters that he called \u201csomewhat related to this case.\u201d  According to securities regulators, from 2007 to 2016, Murakami and a business partner operated three hedge funds through two investment advisory businesses, MC2 Capital and MC2 Canada Capital Management LLC.  Prosecutors said Murakami schemed to defraud investors in a hedge fund he set up in 2011 that was managed by MC2 Canada and that allowed U.S. investors to gain exposure to a fund overseen by Toronto-based Donville Kent Asset Management.  After soliciting money from investors for MC2 Capital Canadian Opportunities Fund, Murakami misused investments for personal expenses like international travel and high-end department stores, according to a criminal complaint.  He also used investor funds to make personal investments in the MC2 Canadian fund; to pay for a black Nissan GT-R sports car; and to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors, prosecutors said.  In a related lawsuit, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Murakami and his partner, Avi Chiat, defrauded more than 50 investors in their three funds after raising more than $15 million.  The regulator said both men misled investors about the funds\u2019 performance. Murakami also stole more than $8 million and used another $1.3 million to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors by misusing funds from later ones, the SEC said.  The criminal case was filed after Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin brought an administrative action in January 2017 accusing Murakami of operating a Ponzi scheme.  The SEC\u2019s case against Chiat remains pending. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.  The case is U.S. v. Murakami, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 17-cr-10346.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three major oil pipeline companies asked a U.S. regulator to reject rival Magellan Midstream Partners\u2019 request for a rehearing on its proposal to establish a marketing arm - due to concerns about a broader effect on their own operations.    In November, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission denied Magellan\u2019s proposal to establish a marketing affiliate to buy, sell and ship crude oil - which many other major midstream companies already operate.   FERC said Magellan\u2019s arm would be \u201cessentially offering capacity below cost,\u201d which Magellan had said in its initial 2016 proposal was necessary for competitive reasons. Magellan requested a rehearing on Dec. 22.  Marketing arms are common in the pipeline industry, but FERC said Magellan\u2019s plans on how it would charge its own affiliate for pipeline space would violate the Interstate Commerce Act, which requires identical rates for the same services.  Magellan\u2019s rivals\u2019 objections stem from a number of new points raised by Magellan in its request that these companies believe would jeopardize their own marketing operations.    Reuters first reported in June that pipeline companies were offering steep discounts through their marketing arms, thus undercutting FERC-mandated shipping rates.  Among those which supported Magellan initially were TransCanada Corp\u2019s Marketlink LLC, Plains All American\u2019s Plains Marketing LP, Enterprise Product Partners LP and Medallion Pipeline Co LLC.  The three companies - Enterprise, Energy Transfer Partners, and Plains Marketing - said in filings that a FERC rehearing could broaden the scope of the proposal and potentially endanger the business of shipping crude oil.  \u201cThese new requests ... may all have serious implications for and impacts upon the liquids pipeline industry as a whole,\u201d Plains said in its filing.   Energy Transfer said new issues raised by Magellan risks a chance that FERC could issue \u201cbroad policy pronouncements,\u201d and said that it and other market participants should be allowed to study and comment on the proceeding.   Magellan\u2019s rehearing request seeks to expand FERC\u2019s \u201climited, fact-specific holding into sweeping, industry-wide regulations and should be rejected,\u201d Enterprise said.  Most of the top 10 largest U.S. pipeline operators, including Enbridge Inc and Enterprise, have already established their own marketing or trading arms.

          "body": "(Reuters) - A vessel that may be carrying liquefied natural gas from Russia\u2019s new Yamal LNG export terminal could be heading to the United States despite sanctions against the company that operates the Russian facility, according to a report by S&P Global Platts and Thomson Reuters shipping data.  The tanker Chris. De Margerie picked up a cargo from Novatek PAO\u2019s Yamal facility, Russia\u2019s second LNG export terminal, on Dec. 9 and dropped it off at National Grid Plc\u2019s Isle of Grain LNG facility near London on Dec. 28, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Since then, Engie SA\u2019s Gaselys LNG tanker picked up LNG from the UK facility on Dec. 30 and is expected to arrive in Boston on Jan. 22.   It is possible that some of the LNG on the Gaselys is from Yamal, according to a report by S&P Global Platts. Reuters has not independently verified that report, but the shipping data does show the routes the tankers are taking. The final destination could change.  Carol Churchill, a spokeswoman for Engie, which bought the cargo in the United Kingdom and loaded it onto one of its vessels, said: \u201cThis transaction is compliant with all U.S. trade laws.\u201d  \u201cGiven the exceptionally cold temperatures and resulting high gas demand in the U.S. Northeast, Engie purchased this spot cargo to supplement our other contracted supplies from Trinidad,\u201d Churchill said. Engie owns the Everett LNG import terminal near Boston.  Churchill did not answer a question about whether any of the gas came from Russia.   National Grid said customer confidentiality limited what information it could disclose.      \u201cBut I also believe we told people at the time that the gas from the Christophe de Margerie had not entered the UK grid,\u201d said Sean Kemp, said a spokesman for National Grid, directing further questions to the shippers and owners.  The U.S. Energy Department was not immediately available for comment.  If the vessel is carrying Russian LNG and ends up in the United States despite the U.S. sanctions against Novatek, it would be the first ever Russian LNG to go to the United States, according to U.S. energy data.  The U.S. imposed sanctions against Novatek in July 2014 due to Russia\u2019s role in the conflict in Ukraine, making it harder for the Russian gas producer to access western financial markets, according to S&P Global.  Novatek is Russia\u2019s largest independent gas producer.  Since Yamal entered service in December 2017, three vessels have picked up LNG cargoes: Chris. De Margerie on Dec. 9 and Jan. 8, Boris Vilkitsky on Dec. 9 and Dec. 22, and Fedor Litke on Dec. 29.  The Boris Vilkitsky dropped off its cargo from Dec. 22 at Rotterdam, according to the map. It is uncertain whether the Boris Vilkitsky actually picked up any gas on Dec. 9 since it did not go anywhere after stopping by the port.  The Fedor Litke is heading to the Montoir LNG terminal in France, according to the map.  Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Lisa Shumaker"

          "title": "Road to bitcoin ETF paved with red tape",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The going is getting tough for U.S. companies hoping to win the race to bring a bitcoin exchange-traded fund to market.  Bitcoin\u2019s 1,500 percent surge last year has stoked investor demand for any product with exposure to the red-hot asset. A host of companies are jostling to launch exchange-traded funds which would open up the cryptocurrency to a broad retail market.  But regulators are asking tough questions, and five fund managers this week shelved plans to launch ETFs based on bitcoin futures, citing concerns from the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.  \u201cWe can expect the SEC to be increasingly watchful over any companies involved in bitcoin activity,\u201d said Marc Butler, a director at compliance management firm Intelligize. \u201cInvestors should be warned. If it\u2019s too good to be true, then it probably is.\u201d  The SEC has pending applications for at least 14 different bitcoin ETFs or related products, regulatory filings show.  A handful of funds have been knocked back. The SEC in March denied a request to list an ETF from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, owners of the Gemini bitcoin exchange.  The Winklevoss fund is seeking to invest in bitcoin directly. Other fund firms staked their hopes on recently launched U.S.-listed bitcoin futures contracts, which promised a more stable base for ETFs than the largely unregulated virtual currency spot market.   But on Monday, Rafferty Asset Management LLC, which manages the Direxion brand and hopes to list leveraged funds that would double bitcoin\u2019s daily price moves, disclosed that the SEC was concerned about the \u201cliquidity and valuation\u201d of bitcoin futures contracts. It said the regulator told it to withdraw its application until it could address those issues.   On Tuesday, ProShare Capital Management LLC, Van Eck Associates Corp and First Trust Advisors LP said in filings that SEC staff asked them to shelve plans for bitcoin ETFs.  Direxion, ProShares, VanEck and the SEC declined to comment. First Trust did not immediately respond to an email.  Bitcoin BTC=BTSP was last down 1.5 percent at $14,779 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.   The race to launch bitcoin funds is still likely to charge forward, analysts said, as fund managers rush to address the SEC\u2019s concerns and redesign their funds to placate the regulator.   \u201cThis is being driven by retail demand,\u201d said Axel Merk, founder and chief investment officer of Merk Investments, which launched a physically backed gold ETF in 2014. \u201cIf people are enthusiastic about bitcoin, then people are going to try to market a bitcoin ETF.\u201d   Merk said he knows of several funds that have examined the criticisms of the past filings and are determined to push through with their bitcoin ETF launches.  Some are also attempting indirect approaches that could provide bitcoin exposure via more traditional assets.   Five fund managers, for instance, have filed proposals for funds that would invest primarily in stocks with exposure to bitcoin or blockchain, the technology used to record bitcoin transactions.  Thorny questions remain for funds that seek to trade in bitcoin futures, including the level of margin required to trade futures and the potential for bitcoin futures to trade at dramatically different prices than the cryptocurrency itself, according to two people who did not want to be identified revealing discussions they had with the SEC.  Regulatory concerns did not stop the market from opening up by way of futures, though scrutiny of digital currency contracts now appears to be ramping up.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission last month allowed CME Group Inc (CME.O) and CBOE Global Markets Inc (CBOE.O) to list bitcoin futures contracts, but recently sought to review its process for listing digital currency futures.  Still, some think that, head-spinning volatility of bitcoin aside, U.S. capital markets risk missing out on a burgeoning technology if they are too cautious.  \u201cIf the SEC doesn\u2019t start allowing products, the capital markets here in the United States will get left behind by those in Europe and Asia. That\u2019s always a concern,\u201d said Trace Schmeltz, a partner at Barnes & Thornburg in Chicago.

The three companies - Enterprise, Energy Transfer Partners, and Plains Marketing - said in filings that a FERC rehearing could broaden the scope of the proposal and potentially endanger the business of shipping crude oil.  \u201cThese new requests ... may all have serious implications for and impacts upon the liquids pipeline industry as a whole,\u201d Plains said in its filing.   Energy Transfer said new issues raised by Magellan risks a chance that FERC could issue \u201cbroad policy pronouncements,\u201d and said that it and other market participants should be allowed to study and comment on the proceeding.   Magellan\u2019s rehearing request seeks to expand FERC\u2019s \u201climited, fact-specific holding into sweeping, industry-wide regulations and should be rejected,\u201d Enterprise said.  Most of the top 10 largest U.S. pipeline operators, including Enbridge Inc and Enterprise, have already established their own marketing or trading arms.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Target Corp (TGT.N) raised its quarterly profit and sales forecasts on Tuesday on the back of surging online sales and customer visits in November and December, putting the U.S.  retailer on track for the best quarter in five years.      The Minneapolis-based chain, whose shares closed up 3 percent at $69.14, raised its fourth-quarter profit forecast to $1.30-$1.40 per share from an earlier range of $1.05-$1.25.  That was well above analysts\u2019 average forecast of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Target is slated to have poured $1 billion of last year\u2019s profits into an effort to boost sales, mainly by investing in online business and delivery options to take on Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).   It has hired more staff, remodeled existing stores and focused on building small-format stores to reach more customers in suburbs.         On Tuesday, the company said same-store sales rose 3.4 percent in November and December and that its online sales growth was on track to report its fourth straight year of more than 25 percent gains.   \u201cTarget\u2019s brick-and-mortar customers are growing in their affinity to the Target online interface, pricing on hot products in the fourth quarter and the ability to deliver in time,\u201d Jim Fosina, chief executive of Fosina Marketing Group, said.   The lack of strong retail and online players who sell both toys and electronics is likely to have helped the company keep its loyalists away from Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) or bankrupt Toys R Us, Fosina said.   Target raised its same-store sales growth forecast for the quarter ending January to 3.4 percent, from a prior forecast of flat to up 2 percent.    Research firm Retail Metrics\u2019 President Ken Perkins said that, if that target were met, it would be the company\u2019s strongest quarterly gain since the first quarter of 2012.  Target\u2019s is the latest in a run of relatively upbeat holiday sales numbers from brick-and-mortar retailers who have suffered most from the huge gains made by Amazon and other online retailers over the past decade.  Department store chain Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) late on Tuesday reported a 1.2 percent rise in comparable store sales for November and December, helped in part by growth in online sales.  The upscale retailer also lifted the low end of its full-year earnings per share forecast by 5 cents to $2.90, keeping the top end unchanged at $2.95.  Shares of department store chain Kohl\u2019s (KSS.N) on Monday surged after it reported a 6.9 percent rise in same-store sales for the same months.   Target said same-store sales in November and December gained in all five of its core merchandise categories: home, apparel, food & beverage, hardlines and essentials.     Kitchen items from brands like Threshold, KitchenAid and Keurig, and cordless vacuums from Roomba and Dyson were popular gifting items.   An exclusive furniture and household goods brand, co-designed by TV personalities Chip and Joanna Gaines, was also a hit after launching in November, the company said.   Target\u2019s fourth-quarter profit forecast includes a 6 cent to 8 cent benefit from the newly approved reduction in Federal corporate tax rates.

          "title": "Continental to flesh out possible overhaul by the summer: CFO",
          "body": "BERLIN/HAMBURG (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s Continental (CONG.DE) is in talks with banks about a possible structural overhaul of the auto parts and tire maker and aims to flesh out its plans within six months, its finance chief said.  The Hanover-based group said on Tuesday it was in \u201cearly stages\u201d of talks about possible structural changes to become more nimble as auto manufacturers are spending billions of euros on electric and self-driving technologies, confirming media reports earlier in the day.  \u201cWe are looking at the organization of Continental in its entirety,\u201d finance chief Wolfgang Schaefer said in an interview late on Tuesday after the group released core 2017 earnings.  Growing demand for electrification and driver-assistance technologies drove Continental\u2019s sales about 8 percent higher last year to around 44 billion euros, and the company expects a further increase to around 47 billion this year.   But its adjusted operating margin may ease to around 10.5 percent this year amid spending on new tire-making facilities, after the profitability benchmark rose to a higher-than-expected 10.8 percent last year, it said.  With the auto industry wrapped up in a strategic transition to zero-emission cars and self-driving technology, carmakers and suppliers are repositioning their businesses and spinning off operations to focus more effectively on new technologies.  Daimler (DAIGn.DE) has said it may split parts of its business into separate legal entities, which may allow for a partial listing to raise funds to invest in new services such as autonomous and electric cars.  Parts makers such as Delphi (DLPH.N) and Autoliv (ALV.N) have spun off divisions to simplify their corporate structures and react to the changes in technology, moves cheered by investors who believe internal combustion engine cars are a sunset industry.       Combustion engines are taking a hit from regulators, particularly those in Europe and China, who want to slash greenhouse gas and smog forming emissions on a fast timetable. That risk was exacerbated by VW\u2019s diesel emissions scandal.  Continental has said software and electronics products are the biggest drivers of growth at the Hanover-based firm which also makes fuel-injection systems and transmission-control units. It plans to boost total sales to more than 50 billion euros by 2020.  A possible separation of its so-called Powertrain business related to combustion engines is not on the agenda, CFO Schaefer said.  Investment banks have presented various ideas over the last couple of months, but no specific blueprint has emerged so far, a person familiar with the matter said.  \u201cWe highlight the pent-up strategic optionality of any potential future spin-offs of individual business units which could unlock value,\u201d London-based HSBC said in a Jan. 4 note, maintaining its \u201cBuy\u201d recommendation on Continental stock.  Shares in the group, which is 46 percent-controlled by the family that owns ball bearings maker Schaeffler (SHA_p.DE), jumped as much as 7.9 percent to a record high of 257.40 euros following the report, and closed 5.4 percent higher at 251.3 euros.      Continental said a year ago it was reviewing its strategy for its Powertrain division after earnings at the business, whose products include transmission control units and fuel pumps, failed to meet expectations.  But it has also pledged to keep developing new products and systems for combustion-based power trains until at least 2025 when it expects demand for electric vehicles to start taking off on the back of continuing reductions in battery prices.  Bloomberg earlier reported Continental was in exploratory talks with advisers on a major overhaul or even a breakup of its business, citing people familiar with the matter.  It said Continental could create a holding company for its divisions and then list shares of the more profitable units, such as the tire business, or combine some operations with rivals.  \u201cAs of today, it is wide open if and which changes could result from these early evaluations,\u201d Continental said. \u201cTo date, there are no plans which could be submitted for approval.\u201d  Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz; Writing by Arno Schuetze and Maria Sheahan; Editing by Jane Merriman, Keith Weir, William Maclean"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Defending champion Stephane Peterhansel doubled his lead in the Dakar Rally to nearly seven minutes on Tuesday after an eventful fourth stage that claimed last year\u2019s motorcycle winner Sam Sunderland.  The 330km timed stretch, out into the desert dunes and back to the Pacific Port of San Juan de Mercona, was won by Peterhansel\u2019s Peugeot team mate and fellow Frenchman Sebastien Loeb.  The nine times world rally champion moved up to second place overall from fourth, six minutes and 55 seconds behind, with Spaniard Carlos Sainz third in a one-two-three for the French manufacturer.  Qatar\u2019s Nasser al-Attiyah, a two times Dakar winner and leader after the opening day, fell to fourth in his Toyota and was 58 minutes adrift of 13 times winner Peterhansel, who was third in the stage.  \u201cIt was a very difficult day. We had two flat tires at the beginning and afterwards we took care because we didn\u2019t have any spares,\u201d al-Attiyah told the Dakar website.  \u201cAt the first dunes, we went into a big hole and got stuck for 30 minutes, before it happened a second time. We lost pressure in one of the tires. We tried to put air back in and we were stuck again for 30 or 20 minutes.\u201d  Peterhansel also suffered low tire pressure and had to stop and make a change, losing several minutes. He then made a navigation error towards the end.  Cyril Despres, who had led after the second stage, saw his chances of winning a sixth title after five on bikes effectively disappear when he broke a rear wheel on his Peugeot and had to wait for assistance.  In the bikes, Sunderland crashed while leading and had to be flown out by helicopter.  His exit meant that Yamaha\u2019s French rider Adrian van Beveren took over the lead, one minute and 55 seconds clear of Chilean Pablo Quintanilla, after winning the stage.   Wednesday\u2019s fifth stage sees the bikes and quads take a different route to the cars and trucks, with all ending up in Arequipa on the last full day in Peru before heading for Bolivia.

          "title": "U.S. top court considers putting brakes on police vehicle searches",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday wrestled with the scope of police authority to search vehicles without warrants, with Chief Justice John Roberts referencing the shiny red convertible taken for a joyride in the 1986 comedy film \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d to make a serious legal point.  The justices heard arguments in two cases in which convicted defendants are seeking to have key evidence against them thrown out because it was obtained by police officers through vehicle searches conducted without a court-issued warrant.  One case involved a stolen motorcycle that was covered by a tarpaulin and parked on private property next to a house in Charlottesville, Virginia. The other involved a rental car stopped by police in Pennsylvania - driven by a man who was not named on the agreement with the rental agency - in which heroin was found.  At issue is whether police in the two cases violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.  In the motorcycle case, Roberts and other justices seemed concerned about issuing a broad ruling in favor of law enforcement that would let police officers not just inspect the immediate area outside a property without a warrant but also potentially inside a house if a vehicle is located there. Under the Fourth Amendment, police need a warrant to search a house unless there is an emergency situation.  In the case of convicted defendant Ryan Collins, the motorcycle was a few feet from the house. In \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d starring Matthew Broderick, three teenagers skip school and take a ride in a red Ferrari that was parked inside a showroom-type space apparently attached to a house.   After mentioning the film\u2019s car, Roberts asked Trevor Cox, the state of Virginia\u2019s lawyer who was defending the police search, whether he was arguing that police \u201ccan just go in\u201d to a house without a warrant because a car is \u201cmobile and they got it in there somehow (so) they can get it out.\u201d  Roberts also mentioned comedian Jay Leno, known for storing a large collection of cars.  Other justices voiced similar concerns, including Neil Gorsuch, who seemed troubled about police officers being able to search garages and other outbuildings without a warrant.  \u201cNot many people live in their garage. Some people do, some people do, and in barns, but usually they\u2019re reserved for cars and for animals. And you\u2019re suggesting that in those places the police can search without a warrant,\u201d Gorsuch told Cox.  Cox said existing legal precedent allowing police to search vehicles without a warrant when they have probable cause should extend to vehicles kept on private property, potentially including those kept in garages, although he said the court could exclude \u201cdwellings.\u201d  Police were looking for the driver of the motorcycle who had on two occasions evaded police pursuit. It turned out to be Collins, who was later convicted of receiving stolen property.   The second case involved a defendant named Terrence Byrd who was stopped by police in 2014 while driving a car his girlfriend had rented. Police said they could search the car without his consent because he was not listed on the rental agreement. The officers found heroin and a bulletproof vest in the car.  Byrd pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of both items on condition that he could challenge the search.   Justice Stephen Breyer appeared to support a ruling that would prohibit a warrantless search in such a case if the driver has the permission of the person named in the rental agreement to use a vehicle as long the driver did not commit a crime in taking possession of the car.  Rulings in both cases are due by the end of June.  Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Ira Rennert has filed a $214 million malpractice lawsuit against his former law firm, after a jury found him liable for looting his magnesium company to build a huge mansion in New York\u2019s Hamptons.

The lawsuit, filed late on Monday in the state supreme court in Manhattan, may be the last chance for Rennert, 83, to avoid a big payout, after the U.S. Supreme Court in October rejected his appeal of the verdict and resulting $213.2 million judgment.  Both had been upheld by the federal appeals court in Manhattan last March.  \u201cWe will vigorously defend these allegations and we are confident that we have fulfilled our professional obligations,\u201d a spokeswoman for Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, the successor firm to Kaye Scholer, said in an email on Tuesday.

His current lawyer, Steven Kaufman, did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit, which also seeks interest.  The case arose from the 2001 bankruptcy of Magnesium Corp of America.   Lee Buchwald, MagCorp\u2019s bankruptcy trustee, accused Rennert of diverting money from the now-defunct company to help build his 21-bedroom, 43,000-square-foot mansion known as Fair Field on 65 oceanfront acres in Sagaponack, on Long Island.  The property was valued last March at $248.5 million, real estate records show.  Jurors in Manhattan federal court found Rennert and Renco liable for $118 million to the MagCorp estate. The trial judge, Alison Nathan, later added interest.  Rennert has long said the verdict made no sense because jurors thought MagCorp was solvent at the time of the alleged transfers.

          "title": "U.S. appeals court upholds Tennessee anti-abortion vote",
          "body": "(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the validity of a 2014 Tennessee ballot measure that removed the right to an abortion from the state constitution.  By a 3-0 vote, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a challenge by eight voters to how the state counted ballots in the election, one of Tennessee\u2019s costliest. The measure, known as Amendment 1, won 53 percent of the vote.  Tuesday\u2019s decision by the Cincinnati-based appeals court overturned a April 2016 lower court ruling ordering a recount. That ruling had been put on hold pending the appeal.  The decision may also encourage the adoption in Tennessee of tighter abortion restrictions, such as a 48-hour waiting period that Republican Governor Bill Haslam signed into law in 2015.  Republicans have big majorities in both houses of Tennessee\u2019s legislature.   Bill Harbison, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a statement said his clients were weighing their options.  \u201cWe continue to believe in the bedrock principle of one person, one vote, and believe that the state\u2019s ratification scheme coupled with certain actors\u2019 unprecedented effort to manipulate a result violated that principle,\u201d Harbison said.  Circuit Judge David McKeague said opponents of Amendment 1 failed to show how Tennessee harmed their due process and equal protection rights, or diluted their votes relative to votes of abortion opponents.  \u201cThis is not the \u2018exceptional case\u2019 that warrants federal intervention in a lawful state election process,\u201d McKeague wrote.  \u201cAlthough the subject of abortion rights will continue to be controversial in Tennessee and across our nation, it is time for uncertainty surrounding the people\u2019s 2014 approval and ratification of Amendment 1 to be put to rest,\u201d he added.  Amendment 1 said, \u201cNothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion.\u201d It also said elected officials may \u201cenact, amend, or repeal statutes regarding abortion.\u201d  The office of Tennessee Republican Attorney General Herbert Slatery said it was gratified that the court found the vote-counting \u201creasonable and true to the meaning of the Tennessee Constitution.\u201d  In ordering a recount, then-Chief Judge Kevin Sharp of the federal court in Nashville called Tennessee\u2019s vote-counting \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d He also said it did not comply with a state constitutional provision that it take into account the number of votes cast for governor.  McKeague was appointed to the appeals court by President George W. Bush. The other panel members, Richard Suhrheinrich and Ronald Gilman, were appointed by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, respectively.  The case is George et al v Hargett et al, 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-5563.  Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Leslie Adler"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of Puerto Rico\u2019s police was asked to step down from her post by the governor of the U.S. territory, she told Reuters, as the island\u2019s authorities struggle to cope with the aftermath of September\u2019s Hurricane Maria.  Governor Ricardo Rossello announced the resignation of Commissioner Michelle Hernandez de Fraley on Monday. But that was at the request of Rossello, Hernandez said.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI did not resign; I was asked to resign by the governor,\u201d Hernandez told Reuters in an email.\u00a0She did not elaborate, other than to say that it was effective immediately, and\u00a0did not respond to additional questions.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 A spokesman for Rossello declined to comment.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Hernandez\u2019s departure follows mounting frustration from police unions in Puerto Rico over delays in\u00a0receiving\u00a0overtime pay, reflected in huge spikes in absenteeism.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Police have been working more overtime than usual since Hurricane Maria smashed the U.S. territory on Sept. 20, killing dozens and knocking out power to all 3.5 million residents. Power has still not been fully restored.  \u00a0 \u00a0 In recent weeks, more than 2,500 police officers a day were calling in sick, Hernandez had said on local media. That equates to some 20 percent of the island\u2019s total police force.   The dip in policing may have contributed to a crime rise since around late December, according to data and anecdotal evidence.  That could be another headache for Puerto Rico, which is in desperate need of investment as it negotiates both its worst disaster in 90 years and the largest\u00a0municipal\u00a0bankruptcy in U.S. history. The island has some $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt, and its bond prices\u00a0have cratered since the storm, in some cases to below 20 cents on the dollar.   In the first week of 2018, Puerto Rico saw 23 murders, more than double the 9 recorded in the same period last year, according to Karixia Ortiz, a spokeswoman for the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety (DPS).\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Douglas Leff, director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s San Juan field office, told Reuters in an interview that criminals in one rural town recently stole a backhoe, then used it to break into numerous businesses.   \u201cThe consensus is that this brazen crime was pulled off because of the absence of police on the streets,\u201d Leff said.  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Although crime has long been relatively high in Puerto Rico, murders had fallen in 2017, according to DPS data. The island finished the year with 679 killings, slightly down from 700 in 2016, the data showed.  Hernandez, a former military officer, was the first woman to lead Puerto Rico\u2019s police force.   \u00a0 \u00a0 Rossello said he had designated Lieutenant Colonel Henry Escalera as interim Commissioner while the administration searched for a replacement.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Rossello\u2019s office said it had also asked for the resignation of Puerto Rico\u2019s tourism minister, Jose Izquierdo, due to a \u201closs of trust\u201d in the director.

          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd\u2019s [HWT.UL] planned deal with U.S. carrier AT&T Inc (T.N) to sell its smartphones in the United States has collapsed at the 11th hour because of security concerns, people with knowledge of the matter said, in a blow to the Chinese firm\u2019s global ambitions.  AT&T was pressured to drop the deal after members of the U.S. Senate and House intelligence committees sent a letter on Dec. 20 to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) citing concerns about Huawei\u2019s plans to launch consumer products through a major U.S. telecom carrier.  The letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, which was signed by 18 lawmakers, noted concerns about Chinese companies in the U.S. telecommunications industry.  The letter notes the committee\u2019s concerns \u201cabout Chinese espionage in general, and Huawei\u2019s role in that espionage in particular.\u201d A copy of the letter was seen by Reuters.  Huawei said in a statement on Tuesday that its flagship smartphone Mate 10 Pro - Huawei\u2019s challenger to the iPhone - will be sold in the United States only through open channels.  \u201cThe U.S. market presents unique challenges for Huawei, and while the HUAWEI Mate 10 Pro will not be sold by U.S. carriers, we remain committed to this market now and in the future,\u201d it said.  Huawei\u2019s Washington-based spokesman William Plummer said on Tuesday that \u201cprivacy and security are always our first priority.\u201d  \u201cWe are compliant with the world\u2019s most stringent privacy protection frameworks and requirements and have gained the trust of over 150 million customers in the past year alone,\u201d Plummer said in an email.  Huawei is the world\u2019s third largest smartphone vendor by volume after Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), but it has a mere 0.5 percent share of the U.S. smartphone market, compared with 39 percent for Apple and 18 percent for Samsung, according to industry tracker Canalys.   Washington began to have concerns about Chinese investment in the United States before President Donald Trump took office last year, and those concerns have heightened.  Because of this skepticism, including the U.S. government\u2019s rejection of several Chinese deals, Chinese investment in the United States fell to $25 billion last year from $50 billion in 2016, according to Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute.  Among the deals killed recently by the multi-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) were Ant Financial\u2019s plan to buy U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O), the purchase by China-backed Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC of a U.S. chip maker and plans by Zhongwang USA, backed by a Chinese aluminum tycoon, to buy a U.S. aluminum maker.  In 2012, Huawei and ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) (0763.HK) were the subject of a U.S. investigation into whether their equipment provided an opportunity for foreign espionage and threatened critical U.S. infrastructure - a link that Huawei has consistently denied.      In the United States, where telecom carriers dominate the distribution channel by typically providing subsidies and special package deals, Huawei had been unable to make any significant inroads due to national security concerns.   AT&T declined to comment.   The flagship Mate 10 Pro that was to be introduced is Huawei\u2019s most high-end product to date, equipped with its own AI-powered chips that Huawei says process data much faster than those used by Apple and Samsung. It was launched in Europe in October with a price tag of 799 euros ($955).   \u201cThis makes it very difficult for Huawei to get significant in the U.S. as the open channels account for only about 10-11 percent of the market,\u201d said Canalys analyst Mo Jia, referring to sales channels outside telecom carriers and vendors\u2019 own stores.  He said Huawei\u2019s proprietary mobile chips may have presented a bigger regulatory hurdle for its U.S. market entry in the current political climate, compared with other Chinese vendors\u2019 entry strategy that relies on U.S. chip suppliers.

          "body": "ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Gunshots and heavy weapons fire erupted late on Tuesday between rival factions within Ivory Coast\u2019s army at military bases in its second largest city, Bouake, residents and soldiers said.  Bouake was the epicentre of several months of army mutinies last year that spread to cities and towns across Ivory Coast, forcing the government to cave in to demands for bonus payments and promotions.   \u201cI\u2019m hearing very intense shooting from machine-guns,\u201d said Bouake resident Georges Kouame. \u201cThere are also explosions from heavy weapons.\u201d   The outbreak of renewed violence follows days of tensions in Bouake between participants in last year\u2019s mutinies and members of an elite military unit, known as the CCDO. At least one person died in the wake of clashes there on Friday.   Former mutineers told Reuters they believed the CCDO members had been sent to Bouake to spy on them.  \u201cAt the moment we are surrounding the CCDO camp and there is an exchange of gunfire,\u201d said one of the mutineers\u2019 leaders. \u201cThey must leave the city or we will force them to leave.\u201d    A regional security source, who asked not to be named, said the government had earlier in the day dispatched around 200 soldiers to reinforce positions in Bouake.  Ivory Coast, the world\u2019s top cocoa grower, has emerged from a decade-long political crisis as one of Africa\u2019s fastest growing economies and a darling of international investors.   However, last year\u2019s instability laid bare the dangerous divisions that still persist within an army cobbled together from rival rebel and loyalist factions at the end of a 2011 civil war.

In a world where the stability of conventional currencies is threatened globally by the vast expansion of central-bank balance sheets, high government indebtedness and the myriad ill consequences of ultra-low interest rates, it would be nice to believe this was the case. Yet bitcoin and its peers are not money and, unless they change fundamentally, never will be.  Bitcoin possesses many of the characteristics of a proper currency: it can be divided, stored (provided it\u2019s not with a dodgy broker where it\u2019s liable to disappear into the ether) and transferred. And its supply is limited. Money is just a social technology which has been through many previous incarnations \u2013 among the exotic varieties of cash listed by Paul Einzig in his book \u201cPrimitive Money\u201d 70 years ago are gin, jam, mulberry cakes, rat traps (in the Congo), and woodpecker scalps. Most of our current money is already held in digital form as electronic book entries at the bank. At first glance, bitcoin with its distributed ledger appears to be simply an advance on the current financial technology.  Its fervid exponents have even greater hopes. They claim that crypto-currencies hail\u00a0the end of state-controlled money. Their vision is borrowed from the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek, who envisaged a denationalisation of money that would bring about an end to both inflation and deflation, cure unemployment and result in the abolition of easy-money-peddling central banks, thereby limiting the reach of governments. What\u2019s not to like?  The trouble is that bitcoin enthusiasts confuse the\u00a0characteristics of money with its nature. This is a thorny subject. Mainstream economic theory has little to say on what money is, assuming it is a contrivance simply to do away with the bother of barter. In the era when bank notes were redeemable in gold, most people believed that money had the intrinsic value of the precious metal. But as John Law, who was responsible for the Mississippi Co bubble in the early 18th century, pointed out: \u201cMoney is not the value by which goods are exchanged but the value for which they are exchanged.\u201d Simply put, gold derived much of its value from its use as money rather than the other way around.  Where, then, does money get its value? From the earliest times, going back at least to Mesopotamia in the third millennium B.C., money has been defined as a unit of account authorized by government for the payment of debts. The state theory of money holds that money is a credit issued by a sovereign, whose value comes from the fact that it can be used to pay taxes. Governments have tenaciously maintained control over the unit of account, a key aspect of sovereignty. The law prescribes this official money as legal tender for the repayment of debt.  Law and his contemporaries had another insight, namely that credit when it circulates acts as money. In the 18th century, much of what constituted money in England comprised bills of exchange issued by merchants against future receipts. At the same time, early English bankers were learning to create money through the act of lending. This bank money was backed by claims of real economic value. The credit theory of money maintains that money is just circulating credit. \u201cCurrency is ephemeral and cosmetic: it is the underlying mechanism of credit accounts and clearing that is the essence of money,\u201d Felix Martin writes in his 2013 book \u201cMoney\u201d.  The economic system commonly referred to as capitalism consists of a vast network of credit relations. Credit money is its key feature. Hayek, of course, realised this. His proposals to strip the government of its money monopoly envisaged the replacement of a dominant central bank with competing private money-issuing banks. Competition between the currency banks would thus produce a sounder currency. But Hayek\u2019s money would still be of the credit variety.  Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are a different kettle of fish. They purport to be non-credit currencies - that is, monetary assets without corresponding liabilities. Yet all money is by its nature a claim upon society, otherwise it cannot be spent. And why should society wish to confer vast monetary claims on the enterprising nerds and opportunistic speculators currently in possession of crypto-fortunes? More importantly, because crypto-currencies lack a mechanism for creating credit they are not well suited to the capitalist economy. Imagine what would happen if bitcoin were accepted as the monetary unit of account. The result would be a scarcity of the digital currency followed by a severe economic contraction and stagnation without end.  This is not going to happen. Not just because it makes no economic sense but because governments are never going to relinquish their monopoly over money any sooner than they will surrender their monopoly on violence. However desirable in theory it may be, Hayek\u2019s proposal to denationalise money was just a pipe dream. As the Nobel laureate economist wrote: \u201cEverybody knows that if such a private experiment promised to succeed, governments would at once step in to prevent it.\u201d  Everybody, that is, apart from the speculators in crypto-currencies. Some of them privately concede that bitcoin may never become money as such, but say that it will retain value as an asset in the same way that gold survived its demonetisation. The counter-argument is that gold has a very long history, an extraordinary durability and a great inherent beauty which lends it enduring lustre, while bitcoin is just a clever piece of open-source software.  This is not to say that the blockchain and similar associated technologies have no future. The new high flyer, ripple, is working with banks to improve the global payments system. It\u2019s a more modest aim than creating a new class of money - but a far more practical one. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

          "title": "Huawei's AT&T U.S. smartphone deal collapses",
          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd\u2019s [HWT.UL] planned deal with U.S. carrier AT&T Inc (T.N) to sell its smartphones in the United States has collapsed at the 11th hour because of security concerns, people with knowledge of the matter said, in a blow to the Chinese firm\u2019s global ambitions.  AT&T was pressured to drop the deal after members of the U.S. Senate and House intelligence committees sent a letter on Dec. 20 to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) citing concerns about Huawei\u2019s plans to launch consumer products through a major U.S. telecom carrier.  The letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, which was signed by 18 lawmakers, noted concerns about Chinese companies in the U.S. telecommunications industry.  The letter notes the committee\u2019s concerns \u201cabout Chinese espionage in general, and Huawei\u2019s role in that espionage in particular.\u201d A copy of the letter was seen by Reuters.  Huawei said in a statement on Tuesday that its flagship smartphone Mate 10 Pro - Huawei\u2019s challenger to the iPhone - will be sold in the United States only through open channels.  \u201cThe U.S. market presents unique challenges for Huawei, and while the HUAWEI Mate 10 Pro will not be sold by U.S. carriers, we remain committed to this market now and in the future,\u201d it said.  Huawei\u2019s Washington-based spokesman William Plummer said on Tuesday that \u201cprivacy and security are always our first priority.\u201d  \u201cWe are compliant with the world\u2019s most stringent privacy protection frameworks and requirements and have gained the trust of over 150 million customers in the past year alone,\u201d Plummer said in an email.  Huawei is the world\u2019s third largest smartphone vendor by volume after Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), but it has a mere 0.5 percent share of the U.S. smartphone market, compared with 39 percent for Apple and 18 percent for Samsung, according to industry tracker Canalys.   Washington began to have concerns about Chinese investment in the United States before President Donald Trump took office last year, and those concerns have heightened.  Because of this skepticism, including the U.S. government\u2019s rejection of several Chinese deals, Chinese investment in the United States fell to $25 billion last year from $50 billion in 2016, according to Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute.  Among the deals killed recently by the multi-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) were Ant Financial\u2019s plan to buy U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O), the purchase by China-backed Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC of a U.S. chip maker and plans by Zhongwang USA, backed by a Chinese aluminum tycoon, to buy a U.S. aluminum maker.  In 2012, Huawei and ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) (0763.HK) were the subject of a U.S. investigation into whether their equipment provided an opportunity for foreign espionage and threatened critical U.S. infrastructure - a link that Huawei has consistently denied.      In the United States, where telecom carriers dominate the distribution channel by typically providing subsidies and special package deals, Huawei had been unable to make any significant inroads due to national security concerns.   AT&T declined to comment.   The flagship Mate 10 Pro that was to be introduced is Huawei\u2019s most high-end product to date, equipped with its own AI-powered chips that Huawei says process data much faster than those used by Apple and Samsung. It was launched in Europe in October with a price tag of 799 euros ($955).   \u201cThis makes it very difficult for Huawei to get significant in the U.S. as the open channels account for only about 10-11 percent of the market,\u201d said Canalys analyst Mo Jia, referring to sales channels outside telecom carriers and vendors\u2019 own stores.  He said Huawei\u2019s proprietary mobile chips may have presented a bigger regulatory hurdle for its U.S. market entry in the current political climate, compared with other Chinese vendors\u2019 entry strategy that relies on U.S. chip suppliers.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s major indexes extended the New Year rally to close at record levels on Tuesday on investor optimism ahead of quarterly earnings reports and hopes for easing tensions with North Korea.  Defensive S&P sectors - utilities, real estate and telecommunications - were out of favor, while bank stocks were boosted by rising U.S. 10-year Treasury yields. Healthcare stocks rose with the sector in focus on the second day of an industry conference.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq registered their sixth closing record highs in a row. The Dow also ended at record levels after it had snapped a 3-day run of closing highs in Monday\u2019s session.  Some investors were reassured that North and South Korea held their first talks in more than two years, which Washington described as a good first step in solving the North\u2019s nuclear missile program crisis. Pyongyang said it would not discuss weapons that were aimed only at the United States.  \u201cThe diplomacy taking place between North Korea and South Korea might circumvent some type of military action. Anything that would de-risk the peninsula would be viewed favorably by investors,\u201d said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.8 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,385.8, the S&P 500 gained 3.58 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,751.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.19 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,163.58.  Profits for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an 8-percent increase a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  \u201cThere will be some noise there with tax adjustments, but the forward-looking comments ought to be pretty positive. Investors are buying into that,\u201d said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  The S&P financial sector ended 0.8 percent higher after yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a 10-month high after the Bank of Japan said it will trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds.  Interest-rate sensitive utilities and real estate sectors ended 1 percent lower while the telecommunications sector fell 1.8 percent.  While investors are hopeful about global economic growth and tax-cut led gains for corporate earnings, they are anxious about whether the tax-overhaul could overheat inflation and lead to a sharper than expected rise in interest rates.  After a lukewarm December jobs report, signs of a pickup in inflation could come in the monthly consumer price report due on Friday, on the same day that big U.S. banks are set to kick off the fourth-quarter earnings season.  The S&P healthcare sector closed 1 percent higher,  boosted by a 1.6-percent rise in Johnson & Johnson, a 5-percent gain in Gilead and a 8.3-percent jump in Boston Scientific shares.  Chip stocks dragged on the technology sector, which fell 0.3 percent. Intel fell 2.5 percent after Microsoft Corp said computers with older Intel chips slowed noticeably after it released security patches.         Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 131 new highs and 24 new lows.    Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.77 billion shares, above the 6.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Despite finishing the first leg of the floodlight race in second place, Shiffrin charged down the course on her second run to win the race by an impressive margin of 0.94 seconds.  It was the 22-year-old\u2019s eighth victory in the last nine races in all disciplines, her form peaking at the perfect time with the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang one month away, and the 41st World Cup win of her career.  Shiffrin is widely expected to retain the Olympic slalom title she won at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia, as well as having a shot at gold medals in the giant slalom and Super G.  Austria\u2019s Bernadette Schild was fastest on the first leg by 0.37 seconds but, skiing last on the second, had already dropped behind Shiffrin\u2019s time on the first third of the course.  Shiffrin said she had been nervous after finishing joint third at the same venue last year and was glad to have won a race after trailing on the first leg.  \u201cMaybe I needed to do that tonight,\u201d she told Austrian broadcaster ORF. \u201cI was a bit anxious about this race and I made some mistakes on the first run. On the second, I finally got what I wanted from this hill.\u201d  Shiffrin, who won her maiden overall World Cup title last season, tops the overall standings with 1,381 points, a lead of 821 over second-placed Wendy Holdener of Switzerland.

          "title": "Obesity linked with disability after joint surgery",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - People who undergo joint surgery, such as joint replacements for arthritis, are more likely to become dependent in the years following surgery if they are obese, researchers say.  Further research is needed to know why this happens and how to prevent it, the study team writes in British Journal of Anaesthesia.  \u201cI think there\u2019s been a lot of research on mortality and a lot of research on complications, but not too much on how people actually get back to how they perform at home,\u201d lead author Dr. Timothy Gaulton told Reuters Health.  \u201cThat was a part of the reason that we wanted to look at the outcome, and in general obese patients,\u201d said Gaulton, of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.  It\u2019s important for potential joint surgery patients to know that in some circumstances, because of their age, weight or preoperative functional dependence, they may be at higher risk of getting worse after surgery, he said in a telephone interview.  \u201cIt\u2019s something that needs to be considered both for the patient and for the surgeon when they make this decision about moving forward with getting a joint surgery,\u201d he said.  The researchers studied 2,519 adults over age 61 who had joint surgery for arthritis. About two-thirds of participants had joint replacements. And 45 percent were obese, meaning they had a body mass index (BMI) - a measure of weight relative to height - of 30 or above at the time of their surgery.   Before surgery and during the following two years, participants were asked if they had any physical, mental, emotional or memory problems that affected their activities of daily living. These activities could include things like getting out of bed, toileting, bathing and eating. Needing help for any of these tasks was labeled as a dependence disability.   About 22 percent of participants reported new or worsening dependence approximately two years after their surgery - including more than one in four obese patients and one in five non-obese patients. Researchers calculated that obese joint surgery patients had a 35 percent higher risk of dependence after surgery compared to non-obese patients.  \u201cWe weren\u2019t surprised by the association between obesity and outcomes, but I think we were surprised that the percentage of patients who had a new disability after surgery was so high. It wasn\u2019t just obese patients, I think it was elderly patients in general,\u201d Gauton said.  Physicians may need to pay a little more attention to, and maybe counsel, not just obese patients but elderly patients in general. \u201cThey come in for surgery and an expectation of getting better. That might not always be the case,\u201d he said.  It is important to note that improvement was seen for most obese and non-obese participants, said Dr. Michael Parks, an orthopedic surgeon with the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.  \u201cSo, the point is, joint surgery is still helpful whether patients are obese or not, but it shows that we need to do something for them more than just replace their joint,\u201d Parks said in a phone interview.  \u201cOne of the things that we do here at HSS, and that I hope is becoming more prevalent nationally, is we work collaboratively with our medical colleagues to try to address obesity,\u201d he said.  It\u2019s also important for patients to become involved in their own health care, Parks added.   \u201cWhether you go to your primary care doctor, whether you go to a nutritionist, whether you go next door to a center for weight loss that\u2019s medical or whether you go to our center for weight loss that\u2019s surgical, the point is, become involved in your health and do something to lose weight to make yourself a better candidate because that has implications on your surgical outcome, your risk, and this study shows that it has a long-term outcome on your dependence and your ability to be independent and your mobility,\u201d he said.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] agreed to pay up to $3 million to settle a proposed class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of 2,421 drivers in New York who accused the ride-sharing company of docking excessive fees from their fares.  A preliminary settlement was filed on Monday with the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis.  Drivers accused Uber of breach of contract for including sales tax and a \u201cBlack Car Fund\u201d fee, which relates to workers\u2019 compensation, in fares when calculating service fees, thereby increasing the amounts owed.  They also accused Uber of false advertising for allegedly offering guaranteed compensation without disclosing the conditions, such as in an ad telling drivers they could \u201cDRIVE & MAKE $5,000 Guaranteed\u201d in their first month behind the wheel.  The San Francisco-based company denied all allegations, and settled without admitting wrongdoing to avoid the cost and inconvenience of litigation, according to the settlement.  Uber did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.  The settlement covers Uber drivers who have used the Uber app to arrange rides in New York since Dec. 29, 2009, and whose claims are not subject to arbitration.  It follows Uber\u2019s agreement to pay more than $80 million to roughly 96,000 drivers in New York, after the company admitted in May to having inadvertently underpaid drivers for two-and-a-half years, court papers show.  Monday\u2019s settlement also calls for the dismissal of claims that Uber misclassified drivers who used the Uber app as independent contractors.  Lawyers for the drivers may collect fees equal to as much as one-third of the settlement fund.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was ready to accept an onslaught of criticism if lawmakers tackle broad immigration reforms after an initial deal to help the young illegal immigrants known as Dreamers and build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.  Trump told lawmakers at the White House he would back a two-phased approach to overhauling U.S. immigration laws with the first step focused on protecting immigrants who were brought here as children from deportation along with funding for a wall and other restrictions that Democrats have opposed.  Once that is done, Trump said, he favors moving quickly to address even more contentious issues, including a possible pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants that is opposed by many Republicans and many of his supporters.  \u201cIf you want to take it that further step, I\u2019ll take the heat, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Trump told lawmakers about a broad immigration bill. \u201cYou are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform. And if you wanted to go that final step, I think you should do it.\u201d  Trump campaigned for the White House in 2016 with a hard-line approach on illegal immigration, and many of his supporters consider potential citizenship for undocumented immigrants to be an unacceptable grant of amnesty.  Trump said on Tuesday he would sign a bill that gives legal status to the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, known as Dreamers, as long as the bill had the border security protections he has sought, including funding for a wall.  \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t mean 2,000 miles of wall because you just don\u2019t need that ... because of mountains and rivers and lots of other things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we need a certain portion of that border to have the wall. If we don\u2019t have it, you can never have security.\u201d   Trump and his fellow Republicans, who control the U.S. Congress, have been unable to reach agreement with Democrats on a deal to resolve the status of an estimated 700,000 young immigrants whose protection from potential deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program ends in early March.  Under pressure from immigrant groups ahead of midterm congressional elections in November, Democrats are reluctant to give ground to Trump on the issue of the wall, his central promise from the 2016 presidential campaign.      But after the meeting, lawmakers from both parties said they would meet as early as Wednesday to continue negotiations on a deal covering DACA and border security, as well as a visa lottery program and \u201cchain migration,\u201d which could address the status of relatives of Dreamers who are still in the United States illegally.  \u201cFrom that standpoint it was a very productive meeting,\u201d said Senator David Perdue, a Republican. \u201cWe have a scope now.\u201d  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the broader bill with a path to citizenship was not a focus for now.  \u201cWe\u2019re certainly open to talking about a number of other issues when it comes to immigration, but right now this administration is focused on those four things and that negotiation, and not a lot else at this front,\u201d she said.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who also was at the meeting, said negotiators in Congress still faced difficulties but it was important that Trump had shown he had \u201cno animosity toward the Dream Act kids\u201d and the \u201cwall is not going to be 2,220 miles wide.\u201d  The U.S. Congress has been trying and failing to pass a comprehensive immigration bill for more than a decade, most recently in 2013 when the Senate passed a bill that later died in the House of Representatives.  The latest immigration negotiations are part of a broader series of talks over issues ranging from funding the federal government through next September to renewing a children\u2019s health insurance program and giving U.S. territories and states additional aid for rebuilding after last year\u2019s hurricanes and wildfires.  Top congressional leaders did not attend the hour-long meeting. The guest list included lawmakers from both parties involved in the immigration debate, such as Graham and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin.  A majority of those protected under DACA are from Mexico and Central America and have spent most of their lives in the United States, attending school and participating in society.  Trump put their fate in doubt in early September when he announced he was ending the DACA program created by former President Barack Obama, which allowed them to legally live and work in the United States temporarily.  Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives, said a DACA bill could win support for passage even though there are differences between the parties over what constitutes necessary border security.   \u201cDemocrats are for security at the border,\u201d Hoyer told Trump during the meeting. \u201cThere are obviously differences, however, Mr. President, on how you affect that.\u201d  On Monday, Trump announced that he was ending immigration protections for about 200,000 El Salvadorans who have been living legally in the United States under the Temporary Protection Status program. Haitians and other groups have faced similar actions.  A congressional aide told Reuters that negotiators in Congress also have been talking about legislation that would expand TPS in return for ending a visa lottery program that Republicans want to terminate.

          "body": "(Adds analyst quote)  BUENOS AIRES, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Argentina\u2019s central bank cut its policy rate to 28 percent from 28.75 percent, two weeks after relaxing its 2018 inflation target, the bank said on Tuesday.  The bank\u2019s first rate cut in 14 months came after a Dec. 28 news conference announcing an official inflation target for this year of 15 percent, up from the bank\u2019s previous target range of 8 percent to 12 percent.  Argentina also has a new 2019 inflation target of 10 percent and 5 percent for 2020. \u201cThis pathway is now the objective of central bank monetary policy,\u201d the bank said in a statement, adding it will be \u201ccautious\u201d in its approach to hitting the new targets.  \u201cNaturally, if you seek a lower rate of disinflation than planned originally, the path of monetary policy will be less contractive than the one before,\u201d the statement said.  Economist Guido Lorenzo of local consultancy ACM Consultores said Tuesday\u2019s rate cut should have been deeper. \u201cGoing forward it will be much more difficult to cut the rate after January and February inflation data comes in,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe time was now,\u201d he added. \u201cGoing forward it will be more difficult to justify a drop in rates.\u201d  Based on expectations of lower interest rates, the local peso has weakened 1.7 percent so far this month to 18.9650 per U.S. dollar, after falling 14.9 percent in full year 2017. A survey of economists published by the central bank earlier this month showed median inflation expectations of 17.40 percent for 2018 and 11.6 for 2019. Argentine December and full-year 2017 consumer price data is scheduled to be released on Thursday.  Inflation was 21 percent in the first 11 months of 2017.  The government late last month postponed by one year its goal of lowering inflation to 5 percent, pushing it back to 2020. The 2019 target will be 10 percent.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it was expanding its safety recall involving Takata Corp front passenger air bag inflators to cover about 601,300 additional vehicles in the United States. [toyota.us/2CV24Wl]  Takata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June after it said it was recalling more than 100 million of its air bag inflators worldwide through the end of 2019 because they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments.   Air bags with the inflators have been linked to at least 180 injuries and 20 deaths, mostly in the United States including one in Louisiana that was identified last month.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Saturday posted a notice from Takata that said the company would recall another 3.3 million inflators for vehicles from automakers including Toyota, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG, Daimler AG, General Motors Co, Tata Motors Jaguar Land Rover unit and Subaru Corp.  NHTSA said in November that 19 automakers had recalled 46 million inflators in 34 million U.S. vehicles \u2014 and by 2019 as many as 70 million U.S. inflators will have been recalled. In June, the agency said only about 35 percent of vehicles recalled have been repaired to date.  In January 2016, Takata agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and pay $1 billion to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into the inflator ruptures.

          "body": "EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s government will amend the European Union withdrawal bill in time for it to win backing from Scotland\u2019s pro-independence devolved administration, Britain\u2019s Scotland minister said on Tuesday.  \u201cI can confirm today that amendments to Clause 11 of the bill will be brought forward in the House of Lords (Britain\u2019s upper legislative chamber), allowing for further discussions to take place between the UK government and Scottish government,\u201d David Mundell said in a statement.  Clause 11 has raised hackles in Scotland and Wales, two of the United Kingdom\u2019s four nations, because it specifies that powers currently held in Brussels return to Britain\u2019s central government in the first instance, although some of them are currently the remit of Britain\u2019s devolved administrations.   With a pledge to amend the proposed law, Mundell may help to soothe fears that devolved powers will be watered down by Brexit.   \u201cOur commitment to improve the bill remains absolute.\u00a0The most important thing is that the changes we bring forward command support on all sides,\u201d he said.  \u201cI remain confident we can reach a place where the Scottish parliament will give legislative consent to this vitally important piece of legislation.\u201d\u00a0  The bill, part of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s strategy for delivering an orderly Brexit, is designed to convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones so that there is clarity after the separation occurs in March 2019.  But it has grated in Edinburgh and Cardiff, which currently control policy areas such as health, education, transport and agriculture, because it does not make clear what the status of their devolved powers will be once Brexit happens.   Both Welsh and Scottish administrations have said that, as it stands, they will not recommend the bill receives consent in their assemblies.   Under Britain\u2019s constitution, the British parliament must seek consent from the Scottish and Welsh assemblies when legislating on policy areas that overlap with their devolved powers.  While they do not have veto powers over the Brexit bill, ignoring their wishes would pressure yet further their already tense relations with London, and could feed public appetite for Scottish independence.

Ford\u2019s plans challenge the ambitions of ride services companies like Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and highlight how automakers and those with roots in the tech industry are forging separate paths to build businesses enabled by self-driving cars.   While Ford has a partnership with ride-hailing company Lyft, the automaker is focusing on moving goods itself for businesses large and small, Jim Farley, president of global markets, and Sherif Marakby, Ford\u2019s head of autonomous and electric vehicle development told Reuters in an interview.   \u201cWe\u2019re testing the business model\u201d for goods delivery, Farley said. Initially, Ford plans to use vehicles with human drivers to test how to run services that would eventually use automated vehicles.   Ford will expand delivery partners beyond Dominos Pizza and San Francisco-based Postmates, Farley said. The automaker sees small businesses as a significant potential market and a natural next step after decades of catering to commercial van and pickup buyers, he said.  In an address at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas, Farley outlined a concept for self-driving vehicles to pick up and deliver packages from multiple small businesses on a single trip. The key for making profit, Farley said, is keeping the cars moving.  \u201cAny time you are not carrying goods or people in this business you are not making money,\u201d Farley said.  The automaker has not named the city where it will begin testing its approach.  Ford intends to power its self-driving cars with plug-in hybrid systems that rely on petroleum-fueled engines to extend range and power the electronics needed for automated driving, Farley and Marakby said.   But top California clean air regulator Mary Nichols had tweeted her objection to that plan last month.   \u201cEarth to Ford: what part of sustainability do you not understand?\u201d Nichols had tweeted. \u201cDriverless hybrid vehicles running 24/7 delivering pizza and passengers means more tons of pollution/GHGs in cities!\u201d  Marakby and Farley said the power demands from computers and sensors can cut the range of an all-electric self-driving car by half.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The inability of law enforcement authorities to access data from  electronic devices due to powerful encryption is an \u201curgent public safety issue,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Tuesday as he sought to renew a contentious debate over privacy and security.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation was unable to access data from nearly 7,800 devices in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 with technical tools despite possessing proper legal authority to pry them open, a growing figure that impacts every area of the agency\u2019s work, Wray said during a speech at a cyber security conference in New York.  The FBI has been unable to access data in more than half of the devices that it tried to unlock due to encryption, Wray added.  \u201cThis is an urgent public safety issue,\u201d Wray added, while saying that a solution is \u201cnot so clear cut.\u201d  Technology companies and many digital security experts have said that the FBI\u2019s attempts to require that devices allow investigators a way to access a criminal suspect\u2019s cellphone would harm internet security and empower malicious hackers. U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, have expressed little interest in pursuing legislation to require companies to create products whose contents are accessible to authorities who obtain a warrant.  Wray\u2019s comments at the International Conference on Cyber Security were his most extensive yet as FBI director about the so-called Going Dark problem, which his agency and local law enforcement authorities for years have said bedevils countless investigations. Wray took over as FBI chief in August.  The FBI supports strong encryption and information security broadly, Wray said, but described the current status quo as untenable.  \u201cWe face an enormous and increasing number of cases that rely heavily, if not exclusively, on electronic evidence,\u201d Wray told an audience of FBI agents, international law enforcement representatives and private sector cyber professionals. A solution requires \u201csignificant innovation,\u201d Wray said, \u201cbut I just do not buy the claim that it is impossible.\u201d  Wray\u2019s remarks echoed those of his predecessor, James Comey, who before being fired by President Donald Trump in May frequently spoke about the dangers of unbreakable encryption.   Tech companies and many cyber security experts have said that any measure ensuring that law enforcement authorities are able to access data from encrypted products would weaken cyber security for everyone.   U.S. officials have said that default encryption settings on cellphones and other devices hinder their ability to collect evidence needed to pursue criminals.  The matter came to a head in 2016 when the Justice Department tried unsuccessfully to force Apple Inc to break into an iPhone used by a gunman during a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.   The Trump administration at times has taken a tougher stance on the issue than former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in October chastised technology companies for building strongly encrypted products, suggesting Silicon Valley is more willing to comply with foreign government demands for data than those made by their home country.

          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc misled U.S. shoppers by selling organic eggs laid by hens raised in enclosed structures under package labels that said the birds had access to the outdoors, a federal lawsuit alleged on Monday.  The suit highlights uncertainty among consumers about production practices in the $500 million organic egg industry, farmers said, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) last month shelved plans to spell out for the first time what it means for birds to have access to the outdoors.  Wal-Mart sells cartons of eggs to shoppers at a premium under its Organic Marketside brand with labels saying the eggs came from hens with \u201coutdoor access,\u201d according to the lawsuit filed by a customer.   However, the birds are raised by Cal-Maine Foods Inc inside enclosed structures that have screens to let in air, the complaint said.  \u201cConsumers paying more for these eggs have been deceived,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cThe theoretical ability to view the outdoors is not the same as having access to it.\u201d  Wal-Mart said it had not reviewed the allegations, but was taking them seriously.  \u201cWe hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality products they expect,\u201d spokesman Randy Hargrove said.  Representatives of Cal-Maine, which is the biggest U.S. egg producer and also named in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Enclosed structures, known as porches, meet USDA standards for producers of organic livestock to provide \u201cyear-round access for all animals to the outdoors,\u201d experts said.  But many consumers expect egg-laying hens will be able to touch the soil and have access to sunshine, said David Bruce, general manager of eggs for Organic Valley, the largest U.S. cooperative of organic farmers.   \u201cIt\u2019s very important that consumers get what they think they\u2019re paying for,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have holes like this that allow that kind of deception.\u201d    The USDA in 2016 issued a proposal that would have defined outdoors as an area in the open air with at least 50 percent soil.   The move was part of an attempt to increase confidence among consumers about organic labels at a time when the USDA said at least half organic egg production came from operations that exclusively used roofed porches to provide outdoor access to hens.  The USDA last year withdrew the proposal.  The case is Donnie Lee Gibson v Wal-Mart Stores et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-00134.

          "title": "U.S. pharma executives expect deals to pick up after tax overhaul",
          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul should accelerate major acquisitions by drugmakers in 2018 after a slow year for deals in 2017, according to senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers.  The $1.5-trillion bill, which U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law in December, lowers the income tax rate for U.S. companies to 21 percent from 35 percent, encourages them to repatriate cash, and modifies numerous deductions.  Brent Saunders, chief executive officer of Allergan Inc, expects tax reform to finally clear the decks for big industry consolidation. Such moves will likely materialize over months\u00a0as companies study the new bill and devise appropriate strategies.\u00a0  In the first half of the year, he expects to see more oncology deals like the one Celgene Corp announced\u00a0on Sunday, a smaller acquisition of cancer drug developer Impact Biomedicines.   Bigger, transformative deals - like the ones where large-cap pharmaceutical companies consolidate with rivals and biotechnology players - will likely take longer, bankers said.   \u201cI think the industry ultimately consolidates,\u201d Saunders said in an interview at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. \u201cI have a sense, though, in terms of a bigger wave of (mergers), it will either happen in the back half of 2018 or in 2019.\u201d  The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has been consolidating for years even without tax reform. Large companies like Merck & Co Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Johnson & Johnson regularly buy or do licensing deals with small companies to help maintain a continuous pipeline of new medicines.   But large-scale deals \u2013 like Merck\u2019s $41.1-billion acquisition of Schering Plough in 2009, or Pfizer Inc\u2019s $68-billion purchase of Wyeth \u2013 have dried up.\u00a0  In early 2016, the Obama administration introduced rules that would punish companies for so-called inversion deals, in which a U.S.-based acquirer bought a smaller firm overseas and moved the combined corporate headquarters abroad to benefit from lower tax rates. The move scuttled Pfizer Inc\u2019s proposed $160-billion purchase of Dublin-based Allergan.  Saunders said Allergan would only begin to look at smaller deals in the second half of the year as the company, known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment, as it is currently focused on cost cutting.  Saunders\u2019 comments echo those of healthcare industry bankers, who say that uncertainty around the tax bill, drug pricing and Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare had cooled merger activity in 2017.\u00a0  Now that the tax law is in place, these bankers say, it should provide a catalyst to drugmaker deals by allowing them to repatriate billions of dollars in foreign profits held abroad, and by making it easier to agree on a value for their acquisition targets since they have a better idea of the company\u2019s tax rate.   Several drugmakers have already announced plans to bring overseas cash into the United States, including Amgen Inc and Bristol-Myers, incurring some short-term charges.  Horizon Pharma CEO Tim Walbert said that when larger companies benefit from that repatriation of cash, they are likely to lift the whole market.  \u201cTo the extent that you see acceleration of large cap deals ... that will bring more confidence in the sector and allow for more strategic opportunities for everyone,\u201d Walbert said.  Horizon does not have substantial money parked overseas, and expects to continue its current strategy of small- and medium-sized acquisitions for drugs treating rare diseases, its primary focus.  Drug industry deals have been trending lower for the past two years. Thomson Reuters data shows that in 2017, there were $52 billion worth of pharma and biotech deals, less than 25 percent of 2015\u2019s $212 billion in deals and down from 2016\u2019s $54 billion.   Johnson & Johnson Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said during a conference session that one reason deals were not getting done was that companies needed to borrow money in the United States, and because it was difficult to structure a deal with low enough taxes.  And Eli Lilly & Co CEO Dave Ricks said that among the uses for cash it repatriates - it has $10 billion overseas - would be more business development including the small, early-stage mergers and acquisitions that are typical of the Indianapolis-based drugmaker.  Merck said that tax reform could spur large deals among companies that are focused on general cost savings. However, that is not Merck\u2019s deal focus: CFO Robert Davis said the company will continue to seek smaller acquisitions to enhance its portfolio of medicines.  \u201cThat being said, getting access now to foreign cash, in a way where you don\u2019t have to worry about the location of the cash will improve our flexibility,\u201d\u00a0 he said.  \u201cWe\u2019re not planning a large one-time repatriation. We will repatriate in a normal course as we see what the needs are for the business.\u201d  Reporting by Caroline Humer and Carl O'Donnell; Editing by Nick Zieminski"

          "body": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma said on Tuesday he will set up a commission of inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling, after a 2016 anti-graft report called for a judge to investigate any corruption in his government.  Zuma was ordered to establish the inquiry within 30 days of a High Court ruling last month, which upheld the recommendations of South Africa\u2019s corruption-fighting Public Protector.  \u201cI am concerned that this matter has occupied the public mind for some time now and deserves urgent attention,\u201d Zuma said in a statement.  Zuma\u2019s announcement comes a day before a meeting of the ruling African National Congress executive committee amid speculation that new party leader Cyril Ramaphosa and his allies are lobbying members to oust Zuma as head of state.  Ramaphosa, who is also deputy president, publicly supports Zuma, whose term does not officially end until 2019 when elections will be held, but he could be removed early through a motion of no confidence in parliament or at the ANC meeting.  The 75-year-old president has faced and denied numerous corruption allegations since taking office in 2009 and has survived several votes of no-confidence in parliament.  Zuma had challenged the right of the Public Protector to call for a judicial inquiry and the appointment by the chief justice of a judge to head it, saying it was the president\u2019s prerogative whether to set up such an inquiry.  Zuma had also previously sought to block the release of the 2016 report, entitled \u201cState of Capture\u201d, which focused on allegations that Zuma\u2019s friends, the businessmen and brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers.  Zuma and the Guptas have denied all accusations of wrongdoing.  Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, selected by the Chief Justice will head the commission, Zuma said in the statement.

Former leftist President Rafael Correa, who had said Assange was a \u201cjournalist,\u201d granted him asylum in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over rape allegations.  The Andean country\u2019s new government, however, has said it is concerned over Assange\u2019s \u201ccomplicated\u201d situation. President Lenin Moreno has described Assange as a \u201chacker,\u201d while stressing he would not be kicked out of the embassy.  \u201cWe\u2019re considering, exploring the possibility of a mediation,\u201d Foreign Minister Maria Fernanda Espinosa told foreign reporters on Tuesday, adding that a third country or person could lead a potential mediation.  \u201cNo solution can be reached without international cooperation and without cooperation from the United Kingdom, which in addition has shown interest in finding a solution.\u201d   Further details were not immediately available.  In May, Sweden dropped the investigation into rape allegations that led Assange to seek asylum in the embassy in 2012, but British police said he would still be arrested if he left the building.  Assange, who denies the rape allegations, fears being handed over to the United States to face prosecution over WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents in one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.

          "body": "TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisian police clashed with anti-government protesters in the capital Tunis and several other towns on Tuesday, residents said, as fresh demonstrations against austerity measures broke out a day after one person was killed in unrest.  Protests erupted in at least 12 towns across Tunisia on Monday, among them the tourist towns of Sousse and Hammamet, against price and tax rises imposed by the government to reduce its ballooning deficit and satisfy international lenders.  In Tunis on Tuesday police fired tear gas in two districts and also fired gas at a crowd storming a supermarket of France\u2019s Carrefour, a witness said. No casualties were reported.  Fresh clashes also broke out in Tebourba, a town 40 km (25 miles) west of Tunis where one protester was killed on Monday, witnesses said, and soldiers could be seen there and in Jelma, a central town where clashes were also reported.  The main opposition party had hours earlier called for protests to continue until the government scrapped what it called an unjust 2018 budget including price and tax hikes.  While Tunisia is widely seen as the only democratic success story among the nations where Arab Spring revolts took place in 2011, it has had nine governments since then and none of them have been able to tackle growing economic problems.  Europe is concerned about stability in Tunisia, partly because unemployment there has forced many young Tunisians to go abroad: The number of boats smuggling migrants to Italy has been rising and Tunisia has also produced the largest number of jihadists heading for battlefields in Iraq, Syria and Libya.  Public anger has been building since Jan. 1, when the government raised the prices of petrol and other items and hiked taxes on cars, phone calls, internet usage and hotel accommodation as part of those economic reforms.  A year ago, the government agreed to a four-year loan programme with the International Monetary Fund worth about $2.8 billion in return for economic reforms.  \u201cToday we have a meeting with the opposition parties to coordinate our movements, but we will stay on the street and we will increase the pace of the protests until the unjust financial law is dropped,\u201d opposition Popular Front leader Hamma Hammami told reporters.  Adding to pressure on the government, Nourredine Taboubi, head of the labour union UGTT, demanded the minimum wage and aid for the poor be raised within a week, state news agency TAP said.  Prime Minister Youssef Chahed called for calm, saying the economy would improve this year. Chahed, who heads a coalition of Islamist and secular parties, has been under constant pressure from labour unions over the faltering economy.  \u201cPeople have to understand that the situation is extraordinary and their country is having difficulties, but we believe that 2018 will be the last difficult year for the Tunisians,\u201d Chahed said.  The 2011 uprising and two major militant attacks in Tunisia in 2015 damaged foreign investment and tourism, which accounts for eight percent of its economic activity.  The demonstrations have so far been much smaller than previous protests since the overthrow of autocrat ruler Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.  But those confrontations between the government, labour unions, Islamists and secular forces also started on a small scale before escalating.  Analysts say Chahed could amend some of his reforms. Under pressure from unions, officials have already agreed to increase public sector salaries this year and to avoid compulsory lay-offs which could provoke protests.  The government says it wants to cut the public sector wage bill to 12.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 from about 15 percent now by offering voluntary redundancies.  But it is also trying to impose higher petrol prices and contributions to social security, which are tough for many people to swallow after years of hardship.  \u201cAt the time of Ben Ali, which we did not like, I filled my stand with vegetables, fruits and other items with 10 dinars, and now 50 dinars do not fill this gap. The situation has worsened dramatically,\u201d said Fatma, a market woman in a Tunis.  \u201cThe government is sacrificing the poor and the middle class by raising prices and ignoring tax evaders and businessmen,\u201d she said.  Separately, a judge ordered the arrest of a finance ministry official on suspicion of graft, another judge said, the first such move against a senior official since Chahed announced a crackdown last year.  The country\u2019s anti-corruption committee says graft is  widespread. It has presented cases against 50 state officials accused of corruption.

          "body": "CIUDAD GUAYANA, Venezuela (Reuters) - A second day of lootings and scattered street protests hit the Ciudad Guayana in southeastern Venezuela on Tuesday, as unrest grows in the once-booming industrial city plagued with food shortages and a malaria outbreak.       At least five food stores were looted overnight, with police sources saying some 20 people had been arrested. Angry Venezuelans also blocked three major roads to demand anti-malaria medicine, food, cooking gas and spare parts for trucks.   There has been increasing unrest around the South American OPEC member in the last few weeks as a fourth straight year of painful recession and the world\u2019s highest inflation leaves millions unable to eat enough.   Erika Garcia tearfully recounted how looters ransacked her food shop and home just 10 minutes after National Guard soldiers who had been patrolling the area withdrew late on Monday night.   \u201cThey stole everything. They broke off the water pipes, they ripped off the toilet bowl, they took away the windows, the fences, the doors, the beds. Everything. They did not kill us because we ran, but they did beat us up,\u201d said Garcia, 38, who planned to sleep at a relative\u2019s house on Tuesday night  She said there was no way she could reopen her store.   The overnight lootings follow at least four similar in the early hours of Monday. Around 10 liquor stores were also looted on Christmas day in southeastern Bolivar state, according to the local chamber of commerce head Florenzo Schettino. [nL1N1OQ0V9]  Critics blame President Nicolas Maduro and the ruling Socialist Party for Venezuela\u2019s economic mess, saying they have persisted with failed statist policies for too long while turning a blind eye to rampant corruption and suffering.  The government says it is the victim of an \u201ceconomic war\u201d by political opponents and right-wing foreign powers, intent on bringing down Maduro in a coup. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the lootings on Tuesday.       The wave of plunder has spooked many in Ciudad Guyana, leading more people to stay indoors come nightfall and dissuading some stores from opening.   Metal worker Alvaro Becerra lives near a store that was ransacked overnight.   \u201cWe lived a night of terror,\u201d said Becerra, 52, adding he heard gunshots and saw people carrying a freezer full of food.   \u201cToday everything is closed.

          "title": "Fusion GPS founder testified Trump associate went to FBI over Russia concerns",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An associate of Donald Trump expressed concerns to the FBI about contacts between Russia and Trump\u2019s presidential election campaign team, helping to trigger the probe into possible collusion, according to closed-door testimony made public on Tuesday by a senior Democrat.  Glenn Simpson, who leads the Washington research firm Fusion GPS, said in his August testimony that the Federal Bureau of Investigation received intelligence from a \u201cvoluntary source\u201d in Trump\u2019s orbit in 2016, before a former British spy gave the FBI his own \u201cdossier\u201d of allegations about collusion.  Fusion GPS hired the former spy, Christopher Steele, to investigate Trump\u2019s business dealings with Russia.  Some Republicans critical of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials have claimed the initial FBI probe was triggered by Steele\u2019s dossier.  They have raised questions about whether the FBI may have relied on the Steele document to improperly obtain surveillance warrants to spy on Trump\u2019s campaign associates.   Simpson\u2019s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in August contradicted those claims.  \u201cThey had other intelligence about this matter from an internal Trump campaign source and ... they believed Chris\u2019 information might be credible,\u201d Simpson testified. \u201cI think it was a voluntary source, someone who was concerned about the same concerns we had.\u201d  Simpson later said he was not sure if the FBI informant was from the Trump election campaign or the Trump Organization, the president\u2019s real estate firm, which is now run by his two older sons.  Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate committee, released the testimony without Republican approval, in an apparent bid to neutralize Republican criticism of the Russia investigation.  Steele\u2019s dossier contains a number of inflammatory and salacious allegations about Trump and his alleged connections to Russia. Trump has slammed the dossier as \u201cbogus\u201d and denies his campaign colluded with Russia.  On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen filed two defamation lawsuits, one in New York state court against the popular website BuzzFeed News, which published the Fusion GPS dossier last year, and the second in federal court against Fusion GPS itself, ABC News reported.  Both lawsuits say the dossier compiled by Fusion GPS and contained \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d allegations about Cohen that resulted in \u201charm to his personal and professional reputation, current business interests, and the impairment of business opportunities,\u201d according to ABC News.  Cohen is mentioned in the dossier as having suspicious ties to Russian figures. Those allegations have not been verified.  BuzzFeed responded with a Twitter post that said the dossier continues to be the subject of investigations by Congress and intelligence agencies, was shown to two U.S. presidents and described in detail by news outlets worldwide.  \u201cIts interest to the public is obvious. This is not the first time Trump\u2019s lawyer has attacked the free press, and we look forward to defending our First Amendment rights in court,\u201d BuzzFeed said.  The lawsuits were not immediately available on online court websites.           Trump and some Republicans have attacked both Simpson\u2019s firm and Steele in recent months and also questioned the impartiality of the FBI and the Justice Department in an apparent effort to discredit Mueller\u2019s probe.  Mueller\u2019s team has produced two indictments and two guilty pleas by former Trump campaign aides.  Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Charles Grassley, had declined to release Simpson\u2019s testimony, saying he had refused to testify at a public hearing and failed to answer questions or turn over records.  Grassley\u2019s office slammed Feinstein for releasing the testimony, saying it came as the panel was still trying to interview other witnesses, including Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.   \u201cHer action undermines the integrity of the committee\u2019s oversight work and jeopardizes its ability to secure candid voluntary testimony,\u201d said Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy.     Democrats accused Republicans of withholding Simpson\u2019s  testimony in order to spread false information about his firm\u2019s role and undermine the Russia probe.  \u201cThe innuendo and misinformation circulating about the transcript are part of a deeply troubling effort to undermine the investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement. \u201cThe only way to set the record straight is to make the transcript public.\u201d  Also on Tuesday, a group of House of Representatives Democrats wrote to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan asking his party to \u201cfully investigate\u201d possible Russian interference in U.S. elections.   \u201cWe ask you to change course and begin demonstrating true leadership on this national security issue,\u201d said the letter,  released a year after U.S. intelligence agencies reported their findings that Russia had sought to intervene in the 2016 election on Trump\u2019s behalf.  Ryan aides did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ryan has previously expressed support for Mueller\u2019s investigation and a separate House probe.  Russia denies meddling in the U.S. presidential election.  Reporting by Sarah N.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production is expected to surpass 10 million barrels per day (bpd) next month, en route to an all-time record months ahead of previous forecasts, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Tuesday.  Production was expected to rise to an average 10.04 million bpd during the first quarter of this year, the agency said in a monthly report. The 10 million-bpd milestone previously had not been expected to be reached until the fourth quarter.   That would match the all-time monthly record of 10.04 million bpd set in Nov. 1970; oil production declined after that as the United States increasingly relied on imported crude. That has changed in the last several years due to the shale revolution, but these projections surpass earlier expectations.  The monthly average for February is expected to surpass 10 million bpd, said Tim Hess, the lead analyst for the report. That will be the first time production has reached that level since 1970.   Only Russia and Saudi Arabia have produced more crude, hitting peak output of over 11 million bpd and about 10.7 million bpd respectively in recent years.  The EIA revised its production growth forecast for 2018 sharply higher to 970,000 bpd from 780,000 bpd in its previous outlook.

Despite the rising production, oil prices edged higher on Tuesday, with U.S. crude touching its highest since December 2014, closing at $62.96 a barrel.

          "body": "(CMHC corrects in second paragraph that apartment starts (not total starts) were up 6.2 percent from 2016; total starts up 9.2 percent)  By Andrea Hopkins  OTTAWA, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Canadian housing starts fell in December, as expected, as a sharp decline in multiple unit urban starts outweighed a rise in single-detached starts, data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation showed on Tuesday.  December\u2019s decline bucked a strong year for homebuilding, with total urban starts up 9.2 percent from 2016 as developers continued to build condos and apartments even as Canada\u2019s long housing boom showed some signs of slowing.  The seasonally adjusted annual rate of starts declined to 216,980 in December from November\u2019s downwardly revised 251,675. Economists had expected a decline to a 212,500 annual rate.  Multiple urban starts, typically condos, fell 22 percent in December while single-detached urban starts rose 4.7 percent, the report showed.  Economists are expecting the torrid pace of homebuilding to cool in 2018 as tighter mortgage lending rules and rising interest rates take some homebuyers out of the market.  \u201cThe trend in permits would imply a softer pace ahead and higher rates will take a bite out of housing demand, but residential investment could still be bolstered by projects started in the back half of the outgoing year,\u201d CIBC Economics economist Nick Exarhos said in a research note.  For 2017 as a whole, starts were down 0.7 percent in Toronto, Canada\u2019s largest city, CMHC said, with demand shifting towards the more affordable condo and townhouse market as years of rising prices made detached homes too expensive for many.  Total 2017 starts were also lower in Vancouver, mostly due to constraints in construction labor and equipment, the federal agency said.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production is expected to surpass 10 million barrels per day (bpd) next month, en route to an all-time record months ahead of previous forecasts, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Tuesday.  Production was expected to rise to an average 10.04 million bpd during the first quarter of this year, the agency said in a monthly report. The 10 million-bpd milestone previously had not been expected to be reached until the fourth quarter.   That would match the all-time monthly record of 10.04 million bpd set in Nov. 1970; oil production declined after that as the United States increasingly relied on imported crude. That has changed in the last several years due to the shale revolution, but these projections surpass earlier expectations.  The monthly average for February is expected to surpass 10 million bpd, said Tim Hess, the lead analyst for the report. That will be the first time production has reached that level since 1970.   Only Russia and Saudi Arabia have produced more crude, hitting peak output of over 11 million bpd and about 10.7 million bpd respectively in recent years.  The EIA revised its production growth forecast for 2018 sharply higher to 970,000 bpd from 780,000 bpd in its previous outlook.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were on track for their sixth closing record in a row. The Dow had snapped a 3-day run of closing records in the previous day\u2019s session.  Defensive S&P sectors - utilities, real estate and telecommunications - were out of favor, while financial and healthcare sectors rebounded to reverse Monday\u2019s losses.  \u201cWhile investor sentiment continues to be high and confidence is high, there\u2019s still some caution from investors. Where do you position yourself\u201d if wage growth pushes up inflation? asked Jeffrey Carbone, managing partner at Cornerstone Wealth in Huntersville, North Carolina. \u201cIt becomes a question of how much longer can this go, how much higher.\u201d  At 3:01 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 124.84 points, or 0.49 percent, to 25,407.84, the S&P 500 gained 7.9 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,755.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.95 points, or 0.24 percent, to 7,174.34.  The interest-rate sensitive utilities index fell 0.8 percent, while the real estate sector was down 1 percent. Telecommunications fell 1.6 percent.  Investors were hopeful about global economic growth and tax-cut led gains for corporate earnings, but they are anxiously watching whether any economic boost from the tax overhaul could overheat inflation and lead to a sharper rise in interest rates.  \u201cSo long as inflation remains at around these levels, it will certainly support the multiples that we have,\u201d said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for The Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank.  After a lukewarm December jobs report, signs of a pickup in inflation could come in the monthly consumer price report due on Friday.  Big U.S. banks are set to kick off fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday. Investors will seek more detail on the impact of corporate tax cuts, and what companies plan to do with the savings.  Profits for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an 8-percent increase a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  A handful of retailers, including Target, Kohl\u2019s Corp and Lululemon Athletica have reported solid rises in same-store sales for the holiday period and raised fourth-quarter profit forecasts.  Boeing was the biggest boost for the Dow with a 2.4-percent increase, after it said it delivered 763 jetliners in 2017, likely retaining its title as the world\u2019s biggest plane maker.  The S&P healthcare sector was boosted by a 1.6-percent rise in Johnson & Johnson, a 4.9-percent gain in Gilead and a 7.9-percent jump in Boston Scientific shares.  The financial sector was helped by a rise in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to a 10-month high after the Bank of Japan said it would trim purchases of Japanese government bonds.  Chip stocks were the biggest drag on the technology sector , which was down 0.09 percent. Intel fell 2.4 percent after reports that systems running on its chips slowed after Microsoft Corp released patches for security threats.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted 122 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 23 new lows.

          "body": "(Refiles to add dropped word \u201cchief\u201d in first paragraph)  By Dasha Afanasieva  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Terra Firma has appointed Vivek Ahuja, former deputy group chief financial officer of Standard Chartered, as group chief financial officer, the buyout fund said on Tuesday, in a bid to rebuild investor support.  The backer of the beleaguered Four Seasons care homes chain is working to reassure investors as it seeks to raise its first proper fund in more than a decade.  Terra Firma has also appointed Mark Elliott as a managing director and head of support capital. Elliott joins from Lloyds Banking Group.  David Browne is joining as a director in the private equity team from Paine Schwartz Partners, a specialist private equity fund based in New York.  Terra Firma, which sources say is seeking 3 billion euros ($3.58 billion) for its latest buyout fund, paid no dividend to its shareholders in the year ending March 2017, it said in company accounts on Thursday, compared with the 3.5 million pounds ($4.7 million) it paid in the previous year. It increased its headcount to 85 from 80.  The firm, which was spun out of Nomura, bought EMI for 2.4 billion pounds in 2007, at the height of the credit bubble. But when EMI\u2019s performance slumped and the financial crisis hit, the buyout house lost its entire investment and had its reputation severely dented.  Since then, the only fund it raised was a single asset fund raised to acquire Ministry of Defence residential company Annington Homes from Nomura which closed at the end of 2012.  The new hires are part of a drive to appease investors who told Terra Firma\u2019s founder Guy Hands to bring in more experienced people in the aftermath of the EMI setback.  The advice prompted the hire of the former chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, Justin King, as vice chairman in 2015 and former Australia & New Zealand Banking Group executive Andrew Geczy as chief executive in 2016.  The firm, which has 11 billion euros in assets under management, is also grappling with a legal dispute with the bondholders of Four Seasons over some of the care homes in the chain.  Asked about the firm\u2019s strategy, Geczy said: \u201cWe look at orphaned, mismanaged assets which are asset backed and need transformation, if possible in essential industries.\u201d ($1 = 0.8383 euros) ($1 = 0.7392 pounds) (Reporting by Dasha Afanasieva; Editing by Adrian Croft)"

          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. biotech bluebird bio Inc, which does not yet have any marketed products, expects to be able to file for regulatory approval of three novel treatments by the end of 2019, chief executive Nick Leschly announced on Tuesday.  Bluebird expects to file for approval this year for its treatment for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, which is intended to eliminate the need for repeated transfusions for the inherited blood disorder, Leschly said at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.  The other two treatments are bluebird\u2019s CAR-T therapy for multiple myeloma, being developed with partner Celgene Corp, and a treatment for a rare and deadly genetic brain disorder, cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, both of which have demonstrated impressive early results.  The company caused a stir at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December with its CAR-T bb2121 as the therapy led to extremely high response and remission rates with good safety in a small study of heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients who had run out of options.  Leschly said the company expects to file for U.S. and European approval of bb2121 in 2019.  Beyond those three, bluebird is also developing a promising treatment for sickle cell disease, a potentially life-shortening inherited blood disorder that causes severe pain and often leads to repeat hospitalizations.  The company plans to discuss appropriate endpoints for future sickle cell clinical trials with health regulators and will provide an update on the program at the end of the year, the CEO said.  He said the company is looking to develop \u201cthe right pricing and reimbursement strategy\u201d for treatments expected to be extremely expensive. The first two approved CAR-T treatments for other cancers from Novartis and Gilead Sciences were priced at $475,000 and $373,000, respectively, for the one-time treatments.  As bluebird progresses toward a portfolio of potentially game-changing commercial treatments, Leschly said one of his overriding principles is: \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid shortsighted stuff.\u201d  \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet,\u201d Leschly said. \u201cWe need to deliver products to patients.\u201d  (This version corrects name of multiple myeloma drug to bb2121 from b2121 in fourth and fifth paragraphs)  Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Tom Brown and Bill Trott"

          "body": "MADRID (Reuters) - Former Catalan president Artur Mas said on Tuesday he would step down as head of his separatist political party to pave the way for new leaders of Catalonia\u2019s independence movement after reports of internal divisions.  Following an illegal referendum last October and the imposition of direct rule on the region by Madrid, the pro-independence movement has become fractured over whether to continue with its push for an independent state or to engage in talks with the Spanish government to gain more regional autonomy in the short term.  A Dec. 21 election gave separatists a slim majority in the regional parliament in a blow to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had hoped it would quash the independence movement and resolve Spain\u2019s worst political crisis in decades.  \u201cThis new stage requires new leaders, it is necessary to leave open spaces so that certain people can lead this project for the future,\u201d Mas told a news conference.  A Catalan court barred Mas from public office in March 2017 for two years for staging an informal referendum on independence in 2014 at a time when secessionist leaders were trying to drum up support for a new ballot.  However, Mas remained leader of the conservative PDeCat party, which he has led for about 15 years.    PDeCat\u2019s political platform in the election, the Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) led by Carles Puigdemont,  emerged as the largest separatist group ahead of Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left).  But Puigdemont remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels after he fled to Belgium with four of his cabinet members when Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia and sacked his government following an Oct. 27 declaration of independence.  He is likely to be detained if he returns to Spain, pending an investigation on charges of sedition, rebellion, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust.  Mas previously supported Puigdemont in his push for independence but he may now favor a different candidate within the PdeCat in order to pave the way for a new separatist-led government, according to Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia.  \u201cThis should not be seen as me walking away from this  project,\u201d he said.  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called for the Catalan parliament to be formed on January 17.  Market-friendly Ciudadanos, which wants Catalonia to remain part of Spain and is led by Ines Arrimadas, gained the largest share of the popular vote but unionist parties did not win enough seats to govern by majority.

Former leftist President Rafael Correa, who had said Assange was a \u201cjournalist,\u201d granted him asylum in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over rape allegations.  The Andean country\u2019s new government, however, has said it is concerned over Assange\u2019s \u201ccomplicated\u201d situation. President Lenin Moreno has described Assange as a \u201chacker,\u201d while stressing he would not be kicked out of the embassy.  \u201cWe\u2019re considering, exploring the possibility of a mediation,\u201d Foreign Minister Maria Fernanda Espinosa told foreign reporters on Tuesday, adding that a third country or person could lead a potential mediation.  \u201cNo solution can be reached without international cooperation and without cooperation from the United Kingdom, which in addition has shown interest in finding a solution.\u201d   Further details were not immediately available.  In May, Sweden dropped the investigation into rape allegations that led Assange to seek asylum in the embassy in 2012, but British police said he would still be arrested if he left the building.  Assange, who denies the rape allegations, fears being handed over to the United States to face prosecution over WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents in one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.

          "title": "Canada, Europe surpass U.S. in published surgical research",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - The U.S., once the world leader in published randomized controlled trials by surgeons, is now outpaced by Canada, the UK and other countries, according to a report in JAMA Surgery.   Researchers from Stanford University evaluated 659 randomized controlled trial reports published by surgeons from 39 countries. Papers published between 2003 and 2015 were extracted from top medical and surgical journals including The New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Surgery and Journal of the American College of Surgeons.   In randomized controlled trials, participants are assigned by chance to separate groups with the purpose of comparing a new treatment to a different treatment or a sham treatment. These studies provide the highest level of evidence and are considered the gold standard. They can last weeks, months or even years.   While the U.S. led the field in absolute number of publications (157, or 23.8%), the UK, Canada and nearly all Western European countries published significantly more randomized controlled trials when adjusted for population.   In 2013-2015, for example, for every 100,000 citizens, the U.S. published 0.03 papers reporting on randomized controlled trials, while Canada published 0.05, the UK published 0.07, Switzerland published 0.10, and the Netherlands published 0.20.  In the same period, for every billion U.S. dollars spent by governments on research and development, the U.S. published 0.07 randomized controlled trials, Canada published 2.4, the Netherlands published 6.5, Switzerland published 7.4, and Denmark published 14.4.  \u201cWe reported the total number of studies this way to normalize the publication rates,\u201d co-author Dr. Jared Forrester explained in an email. \u201cThree published studies in the United States versus the same amount in Switzerland means a very different thing given the available money and human resources.\u201d  \u201cThere are massive problems with surgical clinical trials in the U.S.,\u201d Dr. Andrew Vickers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City told Reuters Health in a phone interview. \u201cThey are incredibly time consuming, expensive and there are impossible regulations enacted by governing bodies necessary to overcome in order to get funded.\u201d   \u201cThere\u2019s a need to radically shift the culture to one of simplification, in more ways than one,\u201d insists Vickers, who was not involved in the Stanford study.  A proposal sometimes goes through no less than six ethics committees, each of which add their own modifications to the original study that must be considered before funding approval, said Vickers.   Adding to the complexity are rigorous subject exclusion criteria and extensive documentation that make it difficult to accrue participants, which can result in trial discontinuation altogether. Furthermore, not all randomized control trials get published.   \u201cThis is especially true when researchers\u2019 hypotheses are disproved,\u201d said coauthor Dr. Sherry Wren in a phone interview. \u201cBut a negative trial is important because it still answers questions.\u201d   \u201cDespite the outcome, when funded, we have an obligation to deliver on our initial investment through completion of our hypothesis testing and disseminate the results,\u201d Forrester agreed.   By showing a decline in published randomized control trials by U.S. researchers, the authors hope to bring attention to the critical need for dedicated surgical research funds.  \u201cIf we want to establish ourselves once again as the preeminent leaders in biomedical research, we need to rise to the occasion. This requires a strongly funded environment. We see this paper as a call-to-arms toward the current system for all U.S. based surgical researchers,\u201d Wren said.

          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. biotech bluebird bio Inc, which does not yet have any marketed products, expects to be able to file for regulatory approval of three novel treatments by the end of 2019, chief executive Nick Leschly announced on Tuesday.  Bluebird expects to file for approval this year for its treatment for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, which is intended to eliminate the need for repeated transfusions for the inherited blood disorder, Leschly said at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.  The other two treatments are bluebird\u2019s CAR-T therapy for multiple myeloma, being developed with partner Celgene Corp, and a treatment for a rare and deadly genetic brain disorder, cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, both of which have demonstrated impressive early results.  The company caused a stir at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December with its CAR-T bb2121 as the therapy led to extremely high response and remission rates with good safety in a small study of heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients who had run out of options.  Leschly said the company expects to file for U.S. and European approval of bb2121 in 2019.  Beyond those three, bluebird is also developing a promising treatment for sickle cell disease, a potentially life-shortening inherited blood disorder that causes severe pain and often leads to repeat hospitalizations.  The company plans to discuss appropriate endpoints for future sickle cell clinical trials with health regulators and will provide an update on the program at the end of the year, the CEO said.  He said the company is looking to develop \u201cthe right pricing and reimbursement strategy\u201d for treatments expected to be extremely expensive. The first two approved CAR-T treatments for other cancers from Novartis and Gilead Sciences were priced at $475,000 and $373,000, respectively, for the one-time treatments.  As bluebird progresses toward a portfolio of potentially game-changing commercial treatments, Leschly said one of his overriding principles is: \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid shortsighted stuff.\u201d  \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet,\u201d Leschly said. \u201cWe need to deliver products to patients.\u201d  (This version corrects name of multiple myeloma drug to bb2121 from b2121 in fourth and fifth paragraphs)  Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Tom Brown and Bill Trott"

          "title": "Unlikely provocateur emerges to challenge Libor class settlements",
          "body": "(Reuters) - The two law firms leading antitrust litigation for over-the-counter investors in financial instruments pegged to the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate unquestionably deserve hosannas for reaching two proposed class action settlements totaling $250 million. The Libor litigation, which accuses more than a dozen of the biggest banks in the world of colluding to manipulate the benchmark rate, has been as complex as any class action in memory.  The case, which dates back to 2011, was devastated by U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald\u2019s dismissal of antitrust claims, then miraculously revived by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but only after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for an interlocutory appeal.  Class counsel from Hausfeld and Susman Godfrey reached their first proposed settlement, a $120 million agreement with Barclays, in March 2016. Judge Buchwald granted preliminary approval to the Barclays deal in December 2016. Hausfeld and Susman Godfrey moved for approval of a second settlement, $130 million with Citigroup, last August. The firms have requested a total of $50 million in fees in the two settlements.  Investors in the Libor over-the-counter class have, in the main, been quite satisfied with the settlements. When Judge Buchwald held a hearing on final approval of the Barclays agreement last October, only two objectors raised qualms about the deal \u2013 a sign, Hausfeld and Susman Godfrey said, of the \u201cphenomenal result\u201d they achieved. (Judge Buchwald has not yet ruled on the motion for final approval.) The Citi settlement, which is scheduled for a preliminary approval hearing on Jan. 23, has prompted only one objection, from the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority.  There\u2019s little doubt Judge Buchwald will approve the Barclays and Citi Libor settlements, given the overwhelming acquiescence of the thousands of investors in the class, many of them extremely sophisticated institutions.  That said, it\u2019s notable that both the lone objector to the Citi settlement and one of the two final objectors to the Barclays deal were represented not by typical objectors\u2019 firms nor even by a typical plaintiffs\u2019 firm. The Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority and Barclays objector Maimonides Medical Center are represented by Arent Fox, a Washington, D.C., firm probably best known for regulatory and defense work.  In fact, the Arent Fox partner working on the Virgin Islands and Maimonides objections, Lester Jacobowitz, isn\u2019t a litigator at all \u2013 he\u2019s a finance lawyer who got into Libor because of a longstanding client relationship with Maimonides. (Arent Fox counsel Jennifer White, a litigator, is working with Jacobowitz.)  \u201cThis is not meant to be a new specialty,\u201d Jacobowitz said. \u201cThe objections are specific to this case. We believe the classes are not being adequately compensated.\u201d  The Virgin Islands\u2019 objection, a 13-page letter to Judge Buchwald, explained that theory. (Arent Fox\u2019s objection for Maimonides to the Barclays settlement, by contrast, was a short letter that Hausfeld and Susman Godfrey called \u201cvague and conclusory.\u201d) The objection asserts that class counsel have not disclosed any estimate of the total damages to the class from Libor manipulation, and that based on Arent Fox\u2019s inquiry, it seems no damages estimate exists. Arent Fox said that its analysis shows damages to be at least $23 billion. In that context, the Virgin Islands objection said, a $130 million settlement with Citigroup is inadequate.  Class counsel justified the proposed settlement by calling it an ice-breaker and highlighting Citi\u2019s promise to cooperate with the ongoing case against other Libor banks. Arent Fox, in the Virgin Islands objection, said the Barclays Libor settlement already broke the ice. As the second bank to settle, the objection said, Citi should not get a big discount.  Hausfeld and Susman Godfrey are due to respond Tuesday to the Virgin Islands objection. They will surely argue, as they did in response to the Maimonides objection to the Barclays settlement, that there are thousands of sophisticated investors in the Libor class and almost none of them have expressed concerns about the settlement.  To that, Jacobowitz said that many public funds and not-for-profits, still reeling from the 2008 financial crisis, aren\u2019t paying attention to the Libor litigation and don\u2019t realize they\u2019re affected by the settlements. According to Arent Fox, class members\u2019 failure to object to the proposed settlements does not necessarily reflect investors\u2019 approval of the deals.  That\u2019s an argument I suspect you wouldn\u2019t hear from lawyers who regularly litigate class actions, in which objections, or a paucity thereof, are widely accepted as a barometer of class members\u2019 attitudes about a proposed settlement. Can Jacobowitz, as a class action outsider, see a truth insiders have become blind to?  (This article has been revised to reflect the following changes: In paragraph 9, damages should read $23 billion. In the 10th graf, it should say Citi should not get a big discount.)

          "title": "Bill Clinton joins calls for release of Reuters journalists in Myanmar",
          "body": "YANGON (Reuters) - Calls grew on Tuesday for the release of two Reuters journalists in Myanmar who are facing accusations of breaching the country\u2019s Official Secrets Act, with former U.S. President Bill Clinton urging that they be freed immediately.  The reporters, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12. They are due to make their second appearance in court in the main city of Yangon on Wednesday.  The two had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a military crackdown that followed militant attacks on security forces.  \u201cA free press is critical to a free society - the detention of journalists anywhere is unacceptable. The Reuters journalists being held in Myanmar should be released immediately,\u201d Clinton said in a Twitter post.  Clinton was U.S. president for much of the 1990s when the United States pressed Myanmar\u2019s then military rulers to release democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi from years of house arrest.  Suu Kyi won a 2015 election and formed a government in early 2016, although she is barred by the constitution from becoming president. She has made no public comment on the case of the two Reuters reporters. Her spokesman has said the case would be handled according to the law.  The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying the two reporters were \u201carrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces.\u201d   It said they had \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media\u201d.  The Official Secrets Act dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.  Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power referred in a post on Twitter to the detention of the two reporters as \u201can outrage & symptom of a world without credible US leadership\u201d.  Government officials from nations such as the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for the release of the reporters.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, Katina Adams, reiterated Washington\u2019s deep concern about the prosecution of the journalists.  \u201cWe call for their immediate and unconditional release, and for the charges against them to be dropped,\u201d she said. \u201cA free press is vital to Burma\u2019s transition and to becoming a viable democracy, and we want Burma\u2019s democracy to succeed.\u201d  Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the reporters.  \u201cAs they near their hearing date, it remains entirely clear that they are innocent of any wrongdoing,\u201d Adler said in a statement on Monday.  A group of Myanmar reporters asked the government on Monday for details about the arrest of the two, arguing that the case could have implications for the ability of journalists to do their jobs.  Authorities have blocked most media access to the north of Rakhine State, where Rohingya militant attacks on the security forces on Aug. 25 sparked the military crackdown.  The United Nations has condemned the Myanmar military campaign as ethnic cleansing. Buddhist-majority Myanmar has rejected the accusation.  The Committee to Protect Journalists also called on Myanmar to release the two reporters.  An independent Myanmar media outlet, the Development Media Group, which is based in and focuses on coverage of events in Rakhine State, also called for the release of the pair.

          "title": "Trump says he would beat Oprah Winfrey in White House race",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he could beat Oprah Winfrey in a presidential race, while one of Winfrey\u2019s closest friends said the media mogul and actress was \u201cintrigued\u201d by the possibility of running but was not considering it now.  Speculation about a 2020 White House bid by Winfrey blew up on social media and news outlets after her rousing \u201cnew day\u201d speech at the Golden Globes awards show on Sunday night, which touched on female and black empowerment, her roots in poverty and support of those who speak up about sexual abuse and harassment.  But some media commentators also injected skepticism into the surge of excitement among fans of the former talk show star, saying the Democratic Party and the country might well reject the notion of another celebrity political novice following Trump\u2019s 2016 election.  Winfrey, long associated with Democratic politics and fundraising, has not commented publicly on the speculation. Known to millions by her first name, Winfrey, 63, has been a cultural force in the country for decades.  Trump, speaking with reporters during a White House meeting with lawmakers, said in response to a question, \u201cYeah I\u2019ll beat Oprah. Oprah would be a lot of fun.  \u201cI know her very well. ... I like Oprah. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to run,\u201d said the Republican president, 71.  Winfrey confidante Gayle King said earlier on Tuesday there was no change in Winfrey\u2019s past position - that she is not interested in running for president.  \u201cI do think she\u2019s intrigued by the idea, I do think that,\u201d King said on the \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d program. \u201cI also know that after years of watching \u2018The Oprah (Winfrey) Show\u2019 you always have the right to change your mind. I don\u2019t think at this point she\u2019s actually considering it.\u201d  However, CNN, citing two of Winfrey\u2019s close friends, reported on Monday that the television and movie producer and actress was actively thinking about a White House bid.  Winfrey has raised millions of dollars for various causes, including shelters for battered women but, like Trump when he launched his White House campaign, she has no prior experience in government. Trump, a businessman and former reality TV star, based part of his appeal on the fact he was truly not a Washington insider.  \u201cNOPRAH! Do we really need another celebrity president?\u201d read the front page of Tuesday\u2019s New York Post. A critique in Slate on Monday was headlined \u201cOprah? Really?,\u201d and bemoaned the \u201cimpossibly boring\u201d current crop of major political figures, making people more likely to vote for celebrities like Trump or Winfrey.  Former Trump White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who was the public face of some of the Trump administration\u2019s early missteps last year, said on the \u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d show that Winfrey lacked \u201cpolitical infrastructure\u201d and would have a hard time adjusting to the White House.  Winfrey first gained national fame with her TV talk show, which often focused on self-improvement and touched on previously taboo subjects like incest, rape, eating disorders and depression. She used the show\u2019s success to build a media empire encompassing movie production, magazines, cable TV, and satellite radio, becoming one of the world\u2019s richest women.  Winfrey also branched out into acting. She is credited with roles in nearly 30 movie and TV productions, including a role in director Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d that earned her an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alex Azar, a former drug industry executive and lobbyist nominated to run the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, indicated on Tuesday he supported a Republican bid to overhaul Medicaid and again vowed to tackle high drug prices.  Azar appeared before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, which will ultimately decide whether to move his nomination forward. Azar also vowed to uphold Obamacare as long as it remained the law but said that the program needed changes.  \u201cI believe I have a very important obligation to make the program work as well as possible,\u201d Azar said during the wide-ranging hearing that lasted more than two hours. \u201cWhat we have now is not working for people.\u201d  Republicans have been trying to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement. Repealing and replacing Obamacare was one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most frequently repeated campaign promises but Congress has repeatedly tried and failed to do so.  Azar said he favored elements of a Republican Senate Obamacare repeal bill that failed to garner enough support last year, which would have fundamentally restructured Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor and disabled.   The doomed measure proposed repealing enhanced federal funding for Medicaid under Obamacare and instead providing block grants to states based on the number of enrollees in each state. The block grants, coupled with the repeal of Medicaid expansion, would slash funding to the 31 states that expanded the government program under Obamacare.  Azar said he supported that element of the legislation because it would provide states more flexibility in deciding how to run their Medicaid programs. Some Republican lawmakers have floated the idea of taking on Medicaid reform as a legislative priority this year.  Azar spent about a decade at Eli Lilly & Co, including five years as president of its U.S. unit. Democrats on Tuesday pointed to a handful of Lilly drugs whose prices more than doubled under Azar\u2019s watch and fiercely questioned how seriously he would work to make prescription drugs more affordable.   During the questioning, Azar did not dismiss the possibility of allowing Medicare, the government health program for the elderly, to negotiate drug prices, a favored proposal among Democrats.  Azar vowed to work with Republicans and Democrats on his four top priorities: drug pricing, making healthcare more affordable and helping people who cannot purchase insurance on the Obamacare market, Medicare reform and the opioid epidemic.  Senator Ron Wyden, the top-ranking Democrat on the committee, said Azar\u2019s promise to work on a bipartisan basis was a welcome change from the previous health secretary, Tom Price, who Wyden said did not work with Democrats.   Price, a former U.S. Republican Representative, resigned in September amid a furor over his use of expensive taxpayer-funded private charter jets for government travel.

Cryptocurrency experts say Venezuela\u2019s mismanagement of its own economy, combined with the ruling Socialist Party\u2019s historic lack of respect for private property rights, will likely leave investors uninterested in acquiring petros.  \u201cThis is not a cryptocurrency, this is a forward sale of Venezuelan oil,\u201d said legislator Jorge Millan. \u201cIt is tailor-made for corruption.\u201d  Legislators warned investors that the petro would be seen as null and void once Maduro, who is up for re-election this year, is no longer in office. They added that the petro issue violates constitutional requirements that the legislature approve borrowing.  The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Maduro has routinely ignored the legislature since his party lost control of it in 2016, and the pro-government Supreme Court has shot down nearly every measure passed since then.  In July, the country elected an all-powerful legislative body called the Constituent Assembly, a vote that was boycotted by the opposition.   The government of U.S. President Donald Trump described the new Constituent Assembly as the consolidation of a dictatorship, and issued sanctions barring U.S. financial institutions from acquiring any debt issued by Venezuela after mid-2017.  That has effectively blocked Maduro\u2019s government from refinancing its hefty debt burden, and would likely add to investor concern about the petro, although it was not specifically mentioned in the sanctions measure.   Maduro hopes it will serve as a payment mechanism for foreign suppliers and avoid the payments delays that have grown more acute since the sanctions went into place.  The government plans in the coming weeks to issue 100 million petros, backed by 100 million barrels of oil reserves.  The petro\u2019s price is initially to be pegged to the value of Venezuela\u2019s basket of oil and fuel exports, which last week closed at $59.07.

          "body": "LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian center-right President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski replaced nearly half of his 19-member Cabinet on Tuesday, after back-to-back crises in his government last month triggered political resignations and protests.  Kuczynski had promised to reveal a \u201cCabinet of reconciliation\u201d nearly two weeks ago amid an uproar over his Christmas Eve pardon for former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, whose loyalists in Congress saved Kuczynski from an impeachment bid three days prior.  A 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, Kuczynski has struggled to govern alongside a Congress controlled by Fujimori\u2019s sympathizers. At least 19 ministers have left Kuczynski\u2019s Cabinet since he took office less than two years ago, including four forced from office by Congress.  However, Fujimori\u2019s loyalists have divided the main opposition party and could help Kuczynski govern, possibly offsetting support that Kuczynski has lost from centrists and leftists.  \u201cDespite our differences, I ask you for us to join together to fight the real problems facing our nation: poverty, unequal services and opportunities, the lack of security, corruption,\u201d Kuczynski said in a brief speech after swearing nine ministers into his Cabinet.  Kuczynski promoted Deputy Energy Minister Angela Grossheim to become energy and mines minister and kept Finance Minister Claudia Cooper and Trade Minister Eduardo Ferreyros in their posts.  Cayetana Aljovin, the outgoing energy and mines minister and a former journalist and lawyer, was named the foreign minister, replacing Ricardo Luna, who had helped Peru lead regional efforts to demand democratic reforms in Venezuela.  Only three out of the eight new ministers who were sworn in on Tuesday have political experience. The rest mostly worked as career civil servants or in the private sector.  Two of the new ministers were members of the rightwing party, Apra, which is affiliated with former President Alan Garcia. Apra announced on Twitter that it was expulsing both for defying the party\u2019s decision to not form part of Kuczynski\u2019s new Cabinet.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alex Azar, a former drug industry executive and lobbyist nominated to run the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, indicated on Tuesday he supported a Republican bid to overhaul Medicaid and again vowed to tackle high drug prices.  Azar appeared before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, which will ultimately decide whether to move his nomination forward. Azar also vowed to uphold Obamacare as long as it remained the law but said that the program needed changes.  \u201cI believe I have a very important obligation to make the program work as well as possible,\u201d Azar said during the wide-ranging hearing that lasted more than two hours. \u201cWhat we have now is not working for people.\u201d  Republicans have been trying to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement. Repealing and replacing Obamacare was one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most frequently repeated campaign promises but Congress has repeatedly tried and failed to do so.  Azar said he favored elements of a Republican Senate Obamacare repeal bill that failed to garner enough support last year, which would have fundamentally restructured Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor and disabled.   The doomed measure proposed repealing enhanced federal funding for Medicaid under Obamacare and instead providing block grants to states based on the number of enrollees in each state. The block grants, coupled with the repeal of Medicaid expansion, would slash funding to the 31 states that expanded the government program under Obamacare.  Azar said he supported that element of the legislation because it would provide states more flexibility in deciding how to run their Medicaid programs. Some Republican lawmakers have floated the idea of taking on Medicaid reform as a legislative priority this year.  Azar spent about a decade at Eli Lilly & Co, including five years as president of its U.S. unit. Democrats on Tuesday pointed to a handful of Lilly drugs whose prices more than doubled under Azar\u2019s watch and fiercely questioned how seriously he would work to make prescription drugs more affordable.   During the questioning, Azar did not dismiss the possibility of allowing Medicare, the government health program for the elderly, to negotiate drug prices, a favored proposal among Democrats.  Azar vowed to work with Republicans and Democrats on his four top priorities: drug pricing, making healthcare more affordable and helping people who cannot purchase insurance on the Obamacare market, Medicare reform and the opioid epidemic.  Senator Ron Wyden, the top-ranking Democrat on the committee, said Azar\u2019s promise to work on a bipartisan basis was a welcome change from the previous health secretary, Tom Price, who Wyden said did not work with Democrats.   Price, a former U.S. Republican Representative, resigned in September amid a furor over his use of expensive taxpayer-funded private charter jets for government travel.

          "body": "LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Tuesday said it will partner with delivery service Postmates Inc as the automaker starts later this year testing in a U.S. city how to transport people, food and packages using its self-driving cars.  Ford\u2019s plans challenge the ambitions of ride services companies like Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and highlight how automakers and those with roots in the tech industry are forging separate paths to build businesses enabled by self-driving cars.   While Ford has a partnership with ride-hailing company Lyft, the automaker is focusing on moving goods itself for businesses large and small, Jim Farley, president of global markets, and Sherif Marakby, Ford\u2019s head of autonomous and electric vehicle development told Reuters in an interview.   \u201cWe\u2019re testing the business model\u201d for goods delivery, Farley said. Initially, Ford plans to use vehicles with human drivers to test how to run services that would eventually use automated vehicles.   Ford will expand delivery partners beyond Dominos Pizza and San Francisco-based Postmates, Farley said. The automaker sees small businesses as a significant potential market and a natural next step after decades of catering to commercial van and pickup buyers, he said.  In an address at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas, Farley outlined a concept for self-driving vehicles to pick up and deliver packages from multiple small businesses on a single trip. The key for making profit, Farley said, is keeping the cars moving.  \u201cAny time you are not carrying goods or people in this business you are not making money,\u201d Farley said.  The automaker has not named the city where it will begin testing its approach.  Ford intends to power its self-driving cars with plug-in hybrid systems that rely on petroleum-fueled engines to extend range and power the electronics needed for automated driving, Farley and Marakby said.   But top California clean air regulator Mary Nichols had tweeted her objection to that plan last month.   \u201cEarth to Ford: what part of sustainability do you not understand?\u201d Nichols had tweeted. \u201cDriverless hybrid vehicles running 24/7 delivering pizza and passengers means more tons of pollution/GHGs in cities!\u201d  Marakby and Farley said the power demands from computers and sensors can cut the range of an all-electric self-driving car by half. Ford does not plan to use full electric systems until the second generation of its self-driving vehicles, Marakby said.  General Motors Co has trained its resources on developing self-driving, all-electric vehicles for use as taxis in big cities. GM has said it will begin launching robo-taxi services in cities by 2019.  Waymo, Alphabet Inc\u2019s self-driving car unit, is launching its first public tests in the suburbs of Phoenix. Waymo is currently using hybrid minivans built by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV .   Toyota Motor Corp on Monday used the backdrop of the CES technology show here to outline plans to develop services for moving goods and people, and showed a prototype of a multi-purpose self-driving vehicle called e\u2010Palette that it intends to begin testing in the early 2020s.  Ford has said it will launch its own self-driving vehicles by 2021.  Reporting By Joseph White; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli"

          "title": "German parties inch closer to coalition with deal on skilled immigrants",
          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s would-be coalition partners have reached agreement on a law to attract skilled immigrants, German media reported on Tuesday, suggesting the parties are edging closer to a decision to open formal coalition negotiations.  Conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel is betting on the reluctant Social Democrats (SPD) to give her a fourth term following 12 years at the helm after her initial efforts to form a coalition with two smaller parties failed in November.  But many in the SPD oppose a repeat of the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that governed for the past four years as they fear it will further weaken the centre-left party, which suffered its worst result in September\u2019s vote since 1933. Some SPD members are also concerned that a new grand coalition would make the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) the main opposition party.  Immigration is one of the most sensitive topics in the talks. German newspaper network RND cited a paper from a working group in the exploratory talks as saying the parties had agreed that skilled workers should be encouraged to come to Germany in an orderly way. But they disagreed on the law\u2019s name, it said.  More than a million migrants, many of them fleeing conflict in the Middle East, have arrived in Germany since mid-2015 but many have struggled to find their feet in the labor market due to a lack of language or vocational skills. Europe\u2019s largest economy needs skilled labor, given its aging population.  The understanding on that topic, following compromises on tax and carbon emissions policy achieved on Monday, indicates the parties could strike a deal to end the political impasse in Germany more than three months after the national election.  The political uncertainty has not cast a shadow over the booming economy, with the government on Tuesday raising its 2017 growth forecast and saying it expected the upswing to continue this year.  That is having a knock-on effect on public finances. The financial daily Handelsblatt reported that the government had a stronger-than-expected surplus in 2017 and that, combined with unused funds earmarked for asylum seekers, means it has 10.4 billion euros more to spend than planned.  Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn said on Twitter that the surplus had been \u201cpriced into\u201d sums being discussed during the exploratory discussions.  Emerging from the talks, Christian Social Union (CSU) Secretary General Andreas Scheuer said, without giving specific details, that the parties had got some interim results but nothing was fixed.  The participants were negotiating hard and seriously and of the mood between the parties, who are not a natural match, he said: \u201cEver since we started the exploratory talks and even in the discussions before them there\u2019s been a trustful and collegial atmosphere so it won\u2019t fail due to that.\u201d  RND also reported that the parties had agreed to expand fast internet around the country by 2025, an investment they expected to require up to 12 billion euros in public financing during this legislative period.  The parties further agreed on tax incentives to promote research and investment in digitalization, RND said.  The conservative bloc and SPD have agreed to keep mum during the five days of exploratory talks due to end on Thursday, when they are due to announce whether they will progress to full-blown coalition talks. The SPD will ask members to vote on that.  SPD leader Martin Schulz said the party chairs had held a good discussion on European Union reform - another topic expected to prove contentious during the talks - but did not give any specifics.   Peter Altmaier, acting finance minister and Merkel\u2019s chancellery chief, said negotiations were tough and it was necessary to recognize \u201cthat we need to pull ourselves together because the people expect that\u201d, and the parties needed to be prepared to enter into compromises on some points.

Harry, fifth-in-line to the throne, and actress Markle, best known for the TV legal drama \u201cSuits\u201d, announced their engagement in November, with the wedding set for May at Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Windsor Castle home to the west of London.  On their second official royal outing together, the couple were greeted by large crowds when they visited the Reprezent radio station in Brixton which was set up in 2008 as part of a response to a rise in knife crime among young people.  The station trains hundreds of young people each year in media and employment skills. It offers training in topics ranging from audio and radio production and editing to communication skills and work experience.  It also runs programs supporting youngsters with specific issues like mental health challenges, a cause dear to Harry\u2019s heart.  Presenter Gloria Beyi, 17, said the couple showed a keen interest in the station\u2019s music.  \u201cThe main thing I observed is they go quite well together,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cThis is genuine - this is real stuff. Having both of them in one room trying to talk to you and having interest in the station, how it works, the relationship between everyone, it\u2019s just so amazing.\u201d  Asked about possible wedding music recommendations, she said: \u201cA little bit of house, a little bit of hip-hop, cos Harry did say that he is interested in hip-hop and house.   \u201cSo, that mixed together at a wedding? Then you\u2019re pretty good. Those two genres if they\u2019re there, you\u2019re pretty sorted for your wedding.\u201d  Harry, 33, and Markle, 36, will marry at Windsor\u2019s St George\u2019s Chapel on May 19.

          "body": "LIMA (Reuters) - Archaeologists have discovered two chambers used for political ceremonies on Peru\u2019s desert coast more than 1,500 years ago that had previously only been glimpsed in the illustrations of the ancient Moche people, an archaeologist said on Monday.  The finding, at the ruins of the Limon archaeological complex in the region of Lambayeque, will provide key clues to understanding the Moche\u2019s political life before the desert society\u2019s sudden decline, said lead archaeologist Walter Alva.  One room features two thrones where a powerful leader and guest likely enjoyed elaborate feasts, said Alva. The other has a circular podium, possibly for making announcements.  The events that took place in the chambers were so important they had been featured repeatedly on Moche ceramics, Alva said.  \u201cThese scenes had been depicted in the iconography of the Moche world but we had never been lucky enough to physically find where they took place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important finding.\u201d  The Moche, one of several complex societies that thrived in Peru long before the rise of the Incan empire, ruled over a vast swath of coastal desert from 100 to 700 AD, thanks to irrigation canals they built to grow crops in desert valleys. The Moche are known for their elaborate gold work and sculptures featuring a wide variety of sexual acts.  Many researchers believe a disastrous climate event, such as the El Nino phenomena that still triggers severe flooding in northern Peru, probably led to the collapse of Moche society.  Alva said construction on part of the recently unearthed chambers appears to have halted abruptly in the 5th century. The rooms were believed to have been used only by the elite, and paintings of fish and sea lions can be seen on the walls.  Women are believed to have held political and religious positions in Moche society. Last year, Peruvian officials and archaeologists unveiled a replica of the face of an ancient female Moche ruler, the Lady of Cao, whose elaborately tattooed body had been buried with weapons and gold objects.

          "body": "(Corrects to remove reference to Target being No. 2 U.S. retailer in paragraph 1)  By Siddharth Cavale  Jan 9 (Reuters) - Target Corp raised its quarterly profit and sales forecasts on Tuesday on the back of surging online sales and customer visits in November and December, putting the U.S.  retailer on track for the best quarter in five years.  Shares of the Minneapolis-based chain rose as much as 4 percent to hit a near one-year high of $69.88 after the company raised its fourth-quarter profit forecast to $1.30-$1.40 a share from an earlier range of $1.05-$1.25.  That was well above analysts\u2019 average forecast of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Target is slated to have poured $1 billion of last year\u2019s profits into an effort to boost sales, mainly by investing in online business and delivery options to take on Amazon.com Inc .  It has hired more staff, remodeled existing stores and focused on building small-format stores to reach more customers in suburbs.  On Tuesday, the company said same-store sales rose 3.4 percent in November and December and that its online sales growth was on track to report its fourth straight year of more than 25 percent gains.  \u201cTarget\u2019s brick-and-mortar customers are growing in their affinity to the Target online interface, pricing on hot products in the fourth quarter and the ability to deliver in time,\u201d Jim Fosina, Chief Executive of Fosina Marketing Group said.  The lack of strong retail and online players who sell both toys and electronics is likely to have helped the company keep its loyalists away from Best Buy Co Inc or bankrupt Toys R Us, Fosina said.  Target raised its same-store sales growth forecast for the quarter ending January to 3.4 percent from a prior forecast of flat to up 2 percent earlier.  Research firm Retail Metrics\u2019 President Ken Perkins said that, if that target were met, it would be the company\u2019s strongest quarterly gain since the first quarter of 2012.  Target is the latest in a run of relatively upbeat holiday sales numbers from brick-and-mortar retailers who have suffered most from the huge gains made by Amazon.com and other online retailers over the past decade.  Shares of department store chain Kohl\u2019s on Monday surged after it reported a 6.9 percent rise in same-store sales for the same months.  Target said same-store sales in November and December gained in all five of its core merchandise categories: home, apparel, food & beverage, hardlines and essentials.  Kitchen items from brands like Threshold, KitchenAid and Keurig, and cordless vacuums from Roomba and Dyson were popular gifting items.  An exclusive furniture and household goods brand, co-designed by TV personalities Chip and Joanna Gaines, was also a hit after launching in November, the company said.  Target\u2019s fourth-quarter profit forecast includes a 6 cent to 8 cent benefit from the newly-approved reduction in Federal corporate tax rates.

In a speech at a Belgian business event, Michel Barnier reiterated that once Britain left the EU on March 29, 2019, its firms would lose the benefits of doing business across a market of 440 million people.  \u201cWe will have the opportunity to treat some UK rules as equivalent, based on a proportionate and risk-based approach, including financial stability, which remains our primary concern,\u201d Barnier said.  The City of London would like to retain the easy access to the EU market it has now, but Barnier said this was not possible.  \u201cIts (Britain\u2019s) financial services cannot benefit from a passport in the single market nor from a system of generalized equivalence of standards,\u201d Barnier said.  Jeremy Browne, the City\u2019s EU envoy, said on Monday the EU\u2019s \u201cone-way\u201d system of equivalence, whereby the EU grants market access to foreign banks if they operate under similar rules to those of the bloc, was a non-starter for most in the City.   \u201cPeople are quite hardline about not having equivalence as the final state,\u201d Browne said.  Barnier, however, said the integrity of the single EU market was sacrosanct and that much depended on the scope of regulatory divergence between the EU and Britain after Brexit.   \u201cThis is neither punishment nor revenge,\u201d he said. \u201cJust that we are masters of our rules and how they are implemented. The United Kingdom, which wants to regain its autonomy of decision-making, must respect ours.\u201d      Member of the European Parliament Nigel Farage, who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU, said on Monday Britain should switch to World Trade Organisation rules with the bloc after Brexit unless it got a good deal on financial services.

Canadian bankers have expressed concern about the progress of talks to rework the trade agreement and how renegotiations could hamper the ability of clients to do business with customers in the United States and Mexico.  McKay said he agreed with other business leaders and the Canadian government that no deal would be better than a bad deal.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be stuck long-term with a deal that hurts our economy,\u201d he said at the 2018 Canadian Bank CEO Conference.  The bosses of Canada\u2019s seven biggest banks were all speaking at the event which covered themes such as technology and Canada\u2019s housing markets as well as the banks\u2019 international expansion plans and the potential impact of trade negotiations.  McKay also said RBC, Canada\u2019s biggest bank by market value, is now spending C$3 billion a year developing new technologies. The bank is one of the biggest Canadian investors in technology such as artificial intelligence and blockchain and has increased the proportion of its technology spending on innovation compared with maintaining existing systems.  Smaller rival Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\u2019s Chief Executive Victor Dodig said the bank was spending around C$1 billion a year on technology, split roughly 50:50 between new technology and existing systems.  Bharat Masrani, chief executive of TD Bank Group, Canada\u2019s second biggest bank, declined to say how much his bank spent annually on technology. TD said on Tuesday it had bought Layer 6, a Toronto-based artificial intelligence firm, for an undisclosed sum.  Brian Porter, chief executive of Bank of Nova Scotia , said Canada\u2019s third biggest lender spent C$3.1 billion on technology last year.  Dodig also said that CIBC was continuing to consider a possible stock market listing of its FirstCaribbean business in New York. Reuters reported last month that the bank was considering the move.  \u201cIn a market like New York, we\u2019ve seen examples of other franchises that have listed there to the benefit of shareholders and to the benefit of those financial institutions and that\u2019s precisely why we\u2019re pursuing this,\u201d he said.

          "body": "MADRID (Reuters) - Former Catalan president Artur Mas said on Tuesday he would step down as head of his separatist political party to pave the way for new leaders of Catalonia\u2019s independence movement after reports of internal divisions.  Following an illegal referendum last October and the imposition of direct rule on the region by Madrid, the pro-independence movement has become fractured over whether to continue with its push for an independent state or to engage in talks with the Spanish government to gain more regional autonomy in the short term.  A Dec. 21 election gave separatists a slim majority in the regional parliament in a blow to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had hoped it would quash the independence movement and resolve Spain\u2019s worst political crisis in decades.  \u201cThis new stage requires new leaders, it is necessary to leave open spaces so that certain people can lead this project for the future,\u201d Mas told a news conference.  A Catalan court barred Mas from public office in March 2017 for two years for staging an informal referendum on independence in 2014 at a time when secessionist leaders were trying to drum up support for a new ballot.  However, Mas remained leader of the conservative PDeCat party, which he has led for about 15 years.    PDeCat\u2019s political platform in the election, the Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) led by Carles Puigdemont,  emerged as the largest separatist group ahead of Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left).  But Puigdemont remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels after he fled to Belgium with four of his cabinet members when Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia and sacked his government following an Oct. 27 declaration of independence.  He is likely to be detained if he returns to Spain, pending an investigation on charges of sedition, rebellion, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust.  Mas previously supported Puigdemont in his push for independence but he may now favor a different candidate within the PdeCat in order to pave the way for a new separatist-led government, according to Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia.  \u201cThis should not be seen as me walking away from this  project,\u201d he said.  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called for the Catalan parliament to be formed on January 17.  Market-friendly Ciudadanos, which wants Catalonia to remain part of Spain and is led by Ines Arrimadas, gained the largest share of the popular vote but unionist parties did not win enough seats to govern by majority.

          "body": "* \u201cPressure on Cryan will now increase\u201d - major investor  * Investors call for stronger U.S. investment bank  * Investors monitor Deutsche performance vs U.S. peers  * Deutsche has warned of 3rd annual loss for 2017  By Tom Sims and Andreas Framke  FRANKFURT, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank\u2019s warning last week of a third year of losses has prompted some investors to question whether John Cryan should be given more time to turn around the bank, after less than three years as chief executive.  After the initial shock of Friday\u2019s announcement by Deutsche Bank that it would post a third consecutive annual loss in 2017, some shareholders are now airing their impatience.  Several top 20 shareholders contacted by Reuters say that Deutsche Bank must swiftly close the gap with its U.S. rivals by winning back market share and improving the performance of its investment bank, especially in the United States.  And support for Cryan, who became CEO in 2015 and was charged with turning the struggling bank around, is waning among some investors who are concerned by the slow progress made.  The 57-year-old British former UBS investment banker had raised their hopes last July when he said that he expected Deutsche Bank to finally return to profit in 2017.  \u201cThe pressure on John Cryan will now increase,\u201d one major shareholder told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Some investors are publicly calling for Deutsche Bank to consider replacing Cryan as CEO following the forecast.  \u201cIt should be considered,\u201d Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon, which owns Deutsche Bank shares, said. \u201cCryan earns a lot of credit, but going forward, I feel it is time for a discussion of a change of strategy at the top and that comes with a different management.\u201d  During his tenure, Cryan has stabilized the bank, raised capital, designed an overhaul, cut costs, confronted daunting legal challenges, and managed the demands of greater regulation.  However, the bank\u2019s shares are now trading 37 percent lower than the day he took over. The stock has lost 7.5 percent since Friday\u2019s profit warning, with the shares hitting their lowest level in nearly two months.  Cryan, who consultancy HKP said earned 3.84 million euros ($4.6 million) in 2016, gave his most recent view on his tenure in a December interview with Boersen-Zeitung newspaper.  Asked whether he wanted to extend his contract when it comes up for renewal in 2020, Cryan said:  \u201cI\u2019m doing well. I am healthy, and I hope for the bank useful. But my contract runs another 2.5 years. The question about how it goes after that hasn\u2019t been posed.\u201d  Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Cryan\u2019s future or the investor calls for a change in strategy.  Germany\u2019s biggest bank announced an overhaul in March last year that included integrating its Postbank retail bank with its in-house consumer bank in an effort to cut costs, as well as the partial sale of its asset management business.  However, Cryan and his deputies have cautioned that the turnaround would be a long, hard slot.  Despite the latest setback, others among Deutsche Bank\u2019s largest investors are giving Cryan time, but prescribing fixes.  \u201cCryan\u2019s strategy as such isn\u2019t in doubt - not yet,\u201d said a person familiar with the thinking of the royal family of Qatar, which owns just under 10 percent of Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares.  \u201cThe problem appears limited to the U.S. investment bank,\u201d said the person, speaking on condition of anonymity.  \u201cDeutsche Bank must take care of this quickly and, for example, find a strong personality who can take over the trading business there to revive it.\u201d  Other investors said they were closely watching the earnings of U.S. competitors to see whether the bank was closing the gap.  Deutsche Bank said last week that revenue at its cash-generating bond-trading division was expected to drop 22 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago.  JPMorgan, the first major Wall Street firm due to report earnings, is due to do so on Friday, with analysts predicting a 15 percent slide in trading revenue at competitors.  \u201cWe are keen to see how other investment banks have performed, but we suspect (weak performance) is something more Deutsche Bank specific,\u201d Assenagon\u2019s Huenseler said.  Ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s, which likens Deutsche Bank\u2019 difficulty to turn around quickly to a supertanker, rates it at the bottom of its peers, with a negative outlook.  A November report by S&P said the bank was focused on an \u201cextended and far-reaching restructuring program; by contrast, many competitors are more focused on business as usual.\u201d  S&P said it would trim the bank\u2019s rating by a notch if it \u201cremains a relative underperformer in its core businesses.\u201d  Despite the bad news for investors, the prospects for some Deutsche Bank staff are looking better after Cryan promised to pay them bonuses in 2017, after virtually abolishing them for 2016.

          "title": "Cotton swabs still a major cause of eardrum perforations",
          "body": " (This 28th December, 2017 story fixes spelling of Dr. Carniol\u2019s name throughout)  By Shereen Lehman  (Reuters Health) - A sampling of U.S. emergency department records confirms that sticking anything smaller than your elbow in your ear is a good way to puncture an eardrum.  About 66 percent of patients treated for traumatic tympanic membrane perforations had hurt themselves by sticking \u201cinstruments,\u201d in their ears, and nearly half of these cases involved cotton-tipped swabs.  \u201cIn our experience, cotton tip applicators (Q-tips and similar products) are frequently the instrument that patients will use to clean their ears,\u201d lead author Dr. Eric Carniol, an otolaryngologist at the University of Toronto, told Reuters Health by email.  \u201cOur conjecture is that the majority of these injuries were caused by patients trying to get their own ear wax out,\u201d he said.  The tympanic membrane, or eardrum, is a structure that transmits sounds from the outer ear to the bones inside the ear, and perforating the membrane can lead to hearing loss, Carniol and his colleagues write in JAMA Otolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery.   Otolaryngologists (Ear, Nose and Throat doctors) see many patients in the office with tympanic membrane perforations that are most often caused by ear infections or trauma, Carniol noted.  The current study focused on the traumatic causes of eardrum perforations. Many patients do not realize they can often injure the ear canal, push earwax further in (impaction), or even burst their eardrum, he said.  The researchers looked at five years of records from 100 nationally representative emergency departments in the U.S. and found over 900 visits for ear-related injuries. These represent almost 5,000 emergency department visits for tympanic membrane perforations nationally during the same period, the researchers write.   About 60 percent of patients were male, and most were 18 years old or younger. \u201cEar canal instrumentation\u201d was the cause of injury in 61 percent of cases, and 45 percent of these specifically involved cotton-tipped applicators, the study found.  For children from infants to 5 years old, foreign instruments were the cause of 86 percent of injuries and for 6-to-12-year olds, it was 66 percent. Among adults 37 to 54 years old, sticking foreign objects in the ears caused 53 percent of perforations and among those 55 or older, it was 67 percent.  Besides cotton swabs, other objects included hairpins, toys, combs, pencils, straws, toothpicks and lollipop sticks.  Water activity, such as water skiing and diving, was also an important cause of injuries particularly among teenagers and 19- to 36-year-olds, Carniol said.  Still, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019ve taken away nothing else from this interview and the article, it is please, do not use Q-tips to clean your ears.\u201d  Carniol said many patients come into his office asking how they should clean the wax from their ears.  \u201cEarwax is made in the outer 1/3 of the ear canal, and it is water-soluble. Therefore, after a shower, most people can get away with just using a washcloth to wipe the wax away from the ear,\u201d he said.  It\u2019s a nice study of emergency room visits for traumatic ear perforation, noted Dr. Hamid Djalilian, a professor of clinical otolaryngology at the University of California, Irvine, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. But the study \u201cdoesn\u2019t capture all the patients who had this problem in the U.S. because it doesn\u2019t include patients who sought care in an outpatient setting such as an urgent care, primary care physician, or ear nose and throat specialist,\u201d he told Reuters Health by email.   The ears have a self-cleaning mechanism, said Djalilian. \u201cThis means that the dead skin of the ear canal along with the earwax gradually move outward and come out of the ear on their own.\u201d Therefore, using a Q-tip (or anything else) is almost never necessary and nearly always will just push in the wax deeper into the canal rather than remove wax.  \u201cA little bit of wax will stick to the Q-tip and make the user feel great about themselves that they accomplish something, but chances are approximately 5-10 times more wax was pushed in,\u201d Djalilian said.  Using Q-tips (or other things) in the ear canal is also the leading cause of ear canal infections as it scratches the ear canal skin and allows bacteria to enter the skin causing an ear canal infection (otitis externa), he noted.

The U.S. central bank raised the discount rate by a quarter percentage point to 2 percent and increased its benchmark lending rate at its Dec. 12-13 meeting.  Directors at the Federal Reserve banks of Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Louis based their decision against raising the discount rate on the disappointing readings on inflation.  The Fed has missed its 2 percent target rate on inflation for six years and inflation weakened for much of 2017.  \u201cThese directors judged that it would be appropriate to... assess whether incoming data support the outlook for continued moderate economic growth, further strengthening in the labor markets, and a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term,\u201d the minutes said.  The presidents of the Chicago and Minneapolis Federal Reserve banks subsequently voted against the interest rate rises at the December meeting and both have since reiterated their concerns on inflation.  St. Louis Fed President James Bullard did not have a vote on the rate-setting committee in 2017. (Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

          "body": "ROME, Jan 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Failure to rein in global temperature rises could cause the marine food web to collapse, devastating the livelihoods of tens of millions of people who rely on fisheries for food and income, scientists have warned.  Warming oceans restrict vital energy flows between different species in the marine ecosystem, reducing the amount of food available for bigger animals - mostly fish - at the top of the marine food web, according to a study in the journal PLOS Biology published on Tuesday.  This could have \u201cserious implications\u201d for fish stocks, said Ivan Nagelkerken, a professor of marine ecology at Australia\u2019s University of Adelaide and one of the study\u2019s authors.  Globally, about 56.5 million people were engaged in fisheries and aquaculture in 2015, according to the latest data from the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  In addition, almost a fifth of animal protein consumed by 3.2 billion people in 2015 comes from fish, FAO said.  The Adelaide scientists set up 12 large tanks, each holding 1,800 litres of water, in a temperature-controlled room to replicate complex marine food webs, and test the effects of ocean acidification and warming over six months.  Plant productivity increased under warmer temperatures but this was mainly due to an expansion of bacteria which fish do not eat, Nagelkerken said in a phone interview.  The findings show that 2015 Paris agreement on curbing global warming must be met \u201cto safeguard our oceans from collapse, loss of biodiversity and less fishery productivity.\u201d  Under the landmark agreement, world leaders agreed to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times.  The United Nations, however, has warned the world is heading towards a 3-degree increase by 2100.  Recent studies have sounded alarm bells for oceans and its inhabitants as the earth continues to experience record-breaking heat.  A Jan. 4 paper published in the journal Science said \u2018dead zones\u2019 - where oxygen is too low to support most marine life - more than quadrupled in the past 50 years due to human activities.  Another said high ocean temperatures are harming tropical corals, which are nurseries for fish, almost five times more often than in the 1980s..

          "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union could treat some British financial regulation as equivalent to EU law after Brexit, but would not give financial firms a general \u201cpassport\u201d to do business in the single market, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator said on Tuesday.  In a speech at a Belgian business event, Michel Barnier reiterated that once Britain left the EU on March 29, 2019, its firms would lose the benefits of doing business across a market of 440 million people.  \u201cWe will have the opportunity to treat some UK rules as equivalent, based on a proportionate and risk-based approach, including financial stability, which remains our primary concern,\u201d Barnier said.  The City of London would like to retain the easy access to the EU market it has now, but Barnier said this was not possible.  \u201cIts (Britain\u2019s) financial services cannot benefit from a passport in the single market nor from a system of generalized equivalence of standards,\u201d Barnier said.  Jeremy Browne, the City\u2019s EU envoy, said on Monday the EU\u2019s \u201cone-way\u201d system of equivalence, whereby the EU grants market access to foreign banks if they operate under similar rules to those of the bloc, was a non-starter for most in the City.   \u201cPeople are quite hardline about not having equivalence as the final state,\u201d Browne said.  Barnier, however, said the integrity of the single EU market was sacrosanct and that much depended on the scope of regulatory divergence between the EU and Britain after Brexit.   \u201cThis is neither punishment nor revenge,\u201d he said. \u201cJust that we are masters of our rules and how they are implemented. The United Kingdom, which wants to regain its autonomy of decision-making, must respect ours.\u201d      Member of the European Parliament Nigel Farage, who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU, said on Monday Britain should switch to World Trade Organisation rules with the bloc after Brexit unless it got a good deal on financial services.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Honey bees are attracted to a fungicide used in agriculture with \u201cunsettling implications\u201d for global food production, a scientist said on Tuesday.  Tests carried out by a team from the University of Illinois showed bees preferred to collect sugar syrup laced with the fungicide chlorothalonil over sugar syrup alone.  The finding follows other studies linking fungicides to a worldwide plunge in honey bee and wild bee populations which are crucial for pollinating crops.  \u201cBees are kind of like humans in that they sometimes like things that aren\u2019t necessarily good for them,\u201d said University of Illinois entomology professor May Berenbaum, who led the research.  She said fungicides were bad news for bees because they could exacerbate the toxicity of pesticides and kill off beneficial fungi in hives.  Her team set up two feeding stations in an enclosure allowing the bees to choose sugar syrup laced with a test chemical or without. The chemicals included three fungicides and two herbicides at various concentrations.  The researchers were taken aback to find the bees choosing one of the fungicides.  \u201cIt was a surprise when they actually liked them,\u201d Berenbaum told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone, adding that it could explain why fungicide contamination in hives was so common.  \u201cThis is not anything that anyone had even thought about before so we need to readjust our focus because there certainly could be implications for agriculture ...\u201d  However, she said the bees actively avoided a second tested fungicide and were neutral about a third.  The scientists said the findings were \u201cworrisome\u201d in light of research showing fungicides interfere with honey bees\u2019 ability to metabolise pesticides used by beekeepers to kill parasitic mites that infest their hives.  The scientists were also surprised to find the bees showed a taste for the widely used herbicide glyphosate.  A study by the Center for Biological Diversity last year said hundreds of native bee species in North America and Hawaii were sliding towards extinction.  It said bees provided more than $3 billion in fruit-pollination services each year in the United States.  Experts have blamed habitat loss, heavy pesticide use, climate change and increasing urbanisation for declining numbers.  The United Nations recently announced an annual World Bee Day on May 20 to raise awareness of their importance and declining numbers.

          "body": "BOGOTA, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Union workers at Colombia\u2019s largest coal mine, Cerrejon, could strike if disagreements at negotiations for wages and benefits are not resolved by Jan. 19, the main union\u2019s president said on Tuesday.  A strike at the Cerrejon mine, which produces 32 million tonnes of coal a year, or about 37 percent of Colombia\u2019s total output, could reduce production and overseas sales from the world\u2019s fifth-largest exporting nation of the mineral.  \u201cIt is very possible that we won\u2019t reach agreement,\u201d Aldo Amaya, president of the Sintracarbon union, told Reuters. \u201cWe are organizing everything because it\u2019s probable there will be a strike at Cerrejon.\u201d  The union has demanded a 12 percent wage increase in the first year, while the company has offered 5.2 percent as well as a bonus to each employee and health and education benefits.  Cerrejon\u2019s offer is above the 4.09 percent inflation for last year, but Amaya said its offer does not meet union expectations given strong coal prices in recent months.  If union members vote to strike, the stoppage could begin three days after. The last strike in Cerrejon, which produces coal at its open pit mine in La Guajira, northern Colombia, was in February 2013 and lasted 32 days.  Cerrejon, which belongs in equal parts to BHP Billiton , Anglo American and Glencore, said on its website that it is confident it will reach a deal with the union. It said its offer is fair and based on projections for a difficult year in international coal markets.  Colombia\u2019s coal output fell 8.1 percent to 21.5 million tonnes in the third quarter from a year earlier. The sector produced 65.1 million tonnes of coal in the nine-month period, 4.4 percent lower than for the same period a year earlier.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it was expanding its safety recall involving Takata Corp front passenger air bag inflators to cover about 601,300 additional vehicles in the United States. [toyota.us/2CV24Wl]  Takata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June after it said it was recalling more than 100 million of its air bag inflators worldwide through the end of 2019 because they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments.   Air bags with the inflators have been linked to at least 180 injuries and 20 deaths, mostly in the United States including one in Louisiana that was identified last month.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Saturday posted a notice from Takata that said the company would recall another 3.3 million inflators for vehicles from automakers including Toyota, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG, Daimler AG, General Motors Co, Tata Motors Jaguar Land Rover unit and Subaru Corp.  NHTSA said in November that 19 automakers had recalled 46 million inflators in 34 million U.S. vehicles \u2014 and by 2019 as many as 70 million U.S. inflators will have been recalled. In June, the agency said only about 35 percent of vehicles recalled have been repaired to date.  In January 2016, Takata agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and pay $1 billion to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into the inflator ruptures.

          "title": "Not all elderly lung cancer patients get recommended care",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - Elderly lung cancer patients who are black or from less educated communities are less likely to get the combination of chemotherapy and radiation that\u2019s linked to better survival odds, a U.S. study suggests.   When patients have advanced, inoperable lung cancer, simultaneous treatment with both chemotherapy and radiation is the standard of care, regardless of age, said lead study author Dr. Richard Cassidy of the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University in Atlanta.   \u201cHowever, this treatment can be very difficult for patients to complete and so doctors always consider the \u201cfull picture\u2019 before recommending a certain type of therapy,\u201d Cassidy said by email.   Even though more than one in three new lung cancers are diagnosed in patients 75 or older, research to date hasn\u2019t offered a clear picture of how the combination of chemotherapy and radiation works for elderly patients, Cassidy and colleagues note in Cancer.   For the current report, researchers studied 12,641 patients who were at least 80 years old when diagnosed with advanced lung tumors between 2004 and 2014.   Overall, 7,921 patients, or 63 percent, received no treatment. After two years, only about 7 percent of these patients were still alive, compared with 31 percent of the people who received combined chemotherapy and radiation.   Black patients were 20 percent less likely than white patients to receive chemotherapy and radiation, the study found.   Patients from communities where more than one in five residents lacked a high school degree had 15 percent lower odds of getting this combination therapy.   At the same time, men were 40 percent more likely to get chemo and radiation than women.   The survival benefit associated with combination therapy persisted even after accounting for factors like age, sex, race, income, and individual tumor characteristics.   One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on the exact cause of death. It\u2019s possible the survival benefits of cancer treatment might be influenced by other competing risks of mortality in this elderly population, the authors note.   Some patients also might have rejected treatment when it was offered to them, either out of concerns about side effects or for other reasons.   \u201cThere are several reasons related to socioeconomic factors,\u201d said Dr. Chris Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.  \u201cIn many cases, African Americans are less likely to have the financial means to seek medical care, such as transportation and some out of pocket expenses, although they are covered by Medicare,\u201d Murray, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.   Treatment disparities in the study might be explained in part by differences in cultural or community beliefs about how aggressively to attack tumors in old age, said Dr. Veena Shankaran of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.  \u201cMany studies have shown that black patients have less access to cancer care and worse cancer outcomes than whites,\u201d Shankaran, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cThis study suggests that the same is true in this elderly population of lung cancer patients.\u201d  Given the better survival with chemotherapy and radiation, it makes sense to consider this option even for elderly patients, said Asal Johnson, a public health researcher at Stetson University in Florida who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   \u201cElderly patients and their physicians should not be discouraged or timid to try available and recommended treatment options, including combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy,\u201d Johnson said by email. \u201cPart of the disparities between older and younger patients can be eliminated if both doctors and patients avoid making conventional assumptions about treatment regimens for the elderly.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2AHJtr0 Cancer, online January 8, 2019.

          "title": "Tesla says solar roof production has started in Buffalo",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said on Tuesday it began manufacturing its premium solar roof tiles at the company\u2019s Buffalo, New York factory last month and has started surveying the homes of customers who made a deposit of $1,000 to reserve the product last year.  The solar roof, which generates electricity without the need for traditional rooftop panels, is a cornerstone of the electric vehicle maker\u2019s strategy to sell a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle under the luxury Tesla brand. Tesla unveiled the product in October 2016 as it sought to acquire solar installer SolarCity.  At that time, Tesla said the product could be rolled out as soon as the summer of 2017. In November, Tesla founder Elon Musk said the product was going through a six-month testing process, saying \u201cit just takes a little while to get this behemoth rolling.\u201d    More than a dozen Tesla employees, including Musk and Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel, had the solar roofs installed on their homes last year as part of an initial pilot program.  Tesla started taking orders for the solar roof tiles in May by asking homeowners to put down a $1,000 deposit via its web site. Tesla would not disclose how many reservations it had received for the solar roof. The product will be installed on some customer rooftops in the coming months.  The company has said its solar roofs would cost between 10 and 15 percent less than an ordinary new roof plus traditional solar panels.  Tesla is collaborating with its longstanding battery partner, Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp, to manufacture solar products at the Buffalo factory. There are about 500 employees working at the site currently, Tesla said.  The companies began production of traditional solar panels at the site last year, but they have not yet been installed on rooftops. The company said it will achieve more than 1 gigawatt of cell and module production in Buffalo, and possibly as much as double that, but gave no timeline for meeting the target.  Tesla said its primary focus is increasing production of its Model 3 sedan. The company said last week it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised.

          "body": "Jan 9 (Reuters) - A vessel that may be carrying liquefied natural gas from Russia\u2019s new Yamal LNG export terminal could be heading to the United States despite sanctions against the company that operates the Russian facility, according to Thomson Reuters Interactive Map.  The Chris. De Margerie tanker picked up a cargo from Novatek PAO\u2019s Yamal facility, Russia\u2019s second LNG export terminal, on Dec. 9 and dropped it off at the Isle of Grain LNG facility near London on Dec. 28, the map showed.  Since then, the Gaselys LNG tanker picked up a load of LNG from the UK facility on Dec. 30 and is expected to arrive in Boston on Jan. 22 to help replenish supplies in the U.S. Northeast reduced by an freeze that blanketed much of the United States for about two weeks after Christmas.  It is possible that some of the LNG on the Gaselys tanker is from Yamal, according to a report by S&P Global Platts.  It is also possible the Gaselys will change its destination away from Boston and the United States, as sometimes occurs with LNG vessels.  If the vessel is carrying Russian LNG and ends up in the United States despite the U.S. sanctions against Novatek, it would be the first ever Russian LNG to go to the United States, according to U.S. energy data.  The U.S. imposed sanctions against Novatek in July 2014 due to Russia\u2019s role in the conflict in Ukraine, making it harder for the Russian gas producer to access western financial markets, according to S&P Global.  Novatek is Russia\u2019s largest independent gas producer.  Since Yamal entered service in December 2017, three vessels have picked up LNG cargoes, Chris. De Margerie on Dec. 9 and Jan. 8, Boris Vilkitsky on Dec. 9 and Dec. 22, and Fedor Litke on Dec. 29.  The Boris Vilkitsky dropped off its cargo from Dec. 22 at Rotterdam, according to the map. It is uncertain whether the Boris Vilkitsky actually picked up any gas on Dec. 9 since it did not go anywhere after stopping by the port.  The Fedor Litke is heading to the Montoir LNG terminal in France, according to the map. (Reporting by Scott DiSavino Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

          "title": "EU regulator delays trading caps in new MiFID setback",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s market watchdog suffered another setback on Tuesday in its efforts to bed down sweeping new securities rules that have already been delayed a year.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) unexpectedly delayed until March the publication of data meant to specify which stocks will be subject to limits on trading in \u201cdark pools\u201d, meaning not on public exchanges.  The regulator said it was forced to delay the restrictions due to insufficient data, pushing back a core element of the bloc\u2019s new MiFID II rules that came into force on Jan. 3, a year later than originally planned.  \u201cThe current quality and completeness of the data does not allow for a sufficiently meaningful and comprehensive publication of double volume cap calculations,\u201d ESMA said in a statement, adding that it expected to be able to publish the data in March.  Under the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) regime, so-called \u201cdouble volume\u201d caps will require dark pools to suspend trading in stocks for which, on average, more than 8 percent of daily trading was transacted in the dark over the past 12 months.  The aim of the caps is to push more trading onto so-called \u201clit\u201d or fully transparent exchanges where all investors can see the prices at which transactions are being made.  ESMA has been collecting data on dark trading but said the quality and completeness of the data fell short of the rigor it would have expected, and publication could have led to an \u201cunlevel\u201d playing field.   \u201cESMA realized that the publication would have resulted in a biased picture covering only a very limited number of instruments and markets,\u201d the watchdog said.  It marks the latest last-minute adjustment made by ESMA and national regulators in a bid to keep MiFID II on track.  Several exchanges have been given temporary relief from competition in clearing.  Market participants have also been given an extra six months to obtain an identifier that is mandatory for reporting trades.  ESMA said it would be able to publish the volume cap data in March after consulting with trading venues and local regulators, and acknowledged that it had given limited time to submit data.  \u201cThe time scales were just simply too tight for that volume of data,\u201d said Toby Bayliss, head of electronic trading for Europe at Bernstein.  The reporting period closed on Dec. 31, and data had to reach ESMA by the close of business on Jan. 5.  Brokers and other market participants have spent months preparing algorithms and trading systems for the introduction of dark pool caps, and were poised to apply the caps on Friday.  \u201cIt\u2019s not wasted work, but it\u2019s perhaps unnecessary pressure that has been put on firms when perhaps there could have been a bit more breathing space,\u201d said Bernstein\u2019s Bayliss.

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen\u2019s armed Houthi movement threatened to block the strategic Red Sea shipping lane if the Saudi-led coalition it is fighting keeps pushing toward the port of Hodeidah it controls, the Houthi-run SABA news agency reported.  Yemen lies beside the southern mouth of the Red Sea, one of the most important trade routes in the world for oil tankers, which pass near Yemen\u2019s shores while heading from the Middle East through the Suez Canal to Europe.  While SABA gave no details on how Houthis could carry out any such move, the Bab al-Mandab strait, where the Red Sea meets the Gulf of Aden in the Arabian Sea, is only 20 km (12 mile) wide, making hundreds of ships potentially an easy target.  \u201cIf the aggressors keep pushing toward Hodeidah and if the political solution hits wall, there are some strategic choices that will be taken as a no return point, including blocking the international navigation in the Red Sea,\u201d Houthis\u2019 Ansarullah political council chief, Saleh al-Samad, was quoted saying.  \u201cTheir ships pass by our waters while our people starve,\u201d Samad was quoted as saying while he met U.N. officials.  U.N. officials have been trying to get the two sides back to the negotiating table after talks collapsed 2016. Samad said his movement was ready to give concessions in any political talks in order to stop the bloodshed.      Yemen, one of the Arab world\u2019s poorest countries, is embroiled in a proxy war between the Houthi armed movement, allied with Iran, and a U.S.-backed military coalition headed by Saudi Arabia.  Some 8 million people are on the brink of famine, more than 10,000 have been killed and tens of thousands of others are struggling with cholera, diphtheria and other diseases.  The Saudi-led coalition has been trying since the start of the war in March 2015 to capture Hodeidah, Yemen\u2019s biggest port, which receives 80 percent of Yemen\u2019s imports, and has in recent weeks launched a ground campaign and intensified air strikes.   On Tuesday, the United Arab Emirates minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said on Twitter the threats were another proof of \u201cthe terrorist nature of the Houthi militias\u201d, especially as Samad was meeting a U.N. delegation. UAE is a major partner of the military coalition fighting the Houthis.  \u201cThe Houthi who decimated crops and seeds, destroyed Yemen, betrayed his ally and partner, is now threatening the international navigation; we are facing a terrorist gang that the end of its existence in Yemen is nigh,\u201d Gargash said.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Tuesday it delivered an industry-record  763 jetliners in 2017, likely beating European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA) to retain the title of world\u2019s biggest plane maker.  Boeing also booked 912 net new aircraft orders worth $134.8 billion at list prices last year, compared with 668 worth about $94 billion in 2016.  Airbus was on track last month to rack up more than 1,000 gross new orders for the year, excluding cancellations, compared with the 1,053 gross orders Boeing announced on Tuesday.   The tallies confer more than just bragging rights; they show the companies\u2019 ability to run factories smoothly, make sales and generate profit.  Boeing shares were up 2.9 percent at $319.16 on Tuesday afternoon. The stock has nearly doubled in the past year.  Industry sources say Airbus, which will report 2017 orders and deliveries on Jan. 15, met its target of delivering more than 700 jetliners, despite problems with Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) Geared Turbofan engines.  Airbus\u2019 total is still unlikely to match Boeing\u2019s. The European firm cut its forecast from more than 720 jets in October due to delays in engine deliveries.  Boeing\u2019s orders and deliveries confirmed the plane maker\u2019s  ability to hit rising production rates. This could mean an additional \u201c$350 million in revenues versus our forecast,\u201d said Sheila Kahyaoglu, analyst at Jefferies.  Boeing also said airlines likely will need more aircraft in 2018, keeping production rates rising.  The company expects airlines to boost passenger capacity by 5.5 percent to 6 percent this year, Randy Tinseth, Boeing vice president of marketing, said on a conference call.   With airlines already flying very full airplanes, more aircraft will be needed. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting growth to be driven by new deliveries, not by more capability out of the existing fleet,\u201d he said.  Price targets for Boeing\u2019s stock are rising. The median is now $310 a share, up from $293.50 in October. Some targets are as high as $380. Still, 12 analysts rate it a \u201chold\u201d compared with 13 with \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201cstrong buy\u201d ratings, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Meanwhile, air cargo traffic is rising, but a sustained gain could arrive too late to rescue Boeing\u2019s 747 aircraft.  Boeing has 12 backlogged orders for 747s, about two years\u2019 production. Tinseth said air cargo companies are interested.   \u201cThe question is when will they be in a position to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to make sure that (demand is) sustained.\u201d   Reporting by Alwyn Scott in New York and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Patrick Graham and Matthew Lewis"

          "body": "(Removes extraneous words in paragraph 3)  JERUSALEM, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Israel will approve construction of hundreds of new settlement homes in the occupied West Bank, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Tuesday.  Settlements are one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, frozen since 2014.  Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Most countries consider as illegal the Israeli settlements built in the territory which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.  Israel disputes that its settlements are illegal and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians.  Israeli authorities were due to approve on Wednesday the construction of 1,285 housing units to be built in 2018 and advance planning for 2,500 others in about 20 different settlements, Lieberman said in a statement.  There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian officials. The Palestinians say Israeli settlements in the West bank, a key issue in peace talks. deny them a viable contiguous state.  U.S.-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014 and a bid by the Trump administration to restart them have shown little sign of progress.  The White House said on Monday U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will visit the region from Jan. 20 to 23, embarking on a tour originally planned for December after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  Pence will hold talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said.  Trump\u2019s decision on Jerusalem and announcement in December that the United States would start the process of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv enraged the Palestinians who said the United States can no longer broker peace with Israel.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the issue will be a major motivating factor for young voters the party is courting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let everyone know where we stand and they stand,\u201d Schumer said at a Capitol Hill news conference in Washington.  The FCC voted in December along party lines to reverse rules introduced in 2015 that barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes. A group of state attorneys general immediately vowed to sue.  A trade group representing major tech companies including Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc said last week it will back legal challenges to the reversal.  The vote in December marked a victory for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc and hands them power over what content consumers can access over the internet. It marked the biggest win for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations.  Senate Democrats on Tuesday called the FCC decision \u201cun-American\u201d and an \u201call-out assault on consumers\u201d  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, backs the FCC repeal. A reversal of the FCC vote would need the approval of the Senate, U.S. House and President Donald Trump. Trump also backed the FCC action, the White House said last month.  The FCC order grants internet providers sweeping new powers to block, throttle or discriminate among internet content, but requires public disclosure of those practices. Internet providers have vowed not to change how consumers get online content.  Democrats say net neutrality is essential to protect consumers, while Republicans say the rules hindered investment by providers and were not needed.  Democratic Senator Ed Markey said on Tuesday he had 39 co-sponsors to force a vote, but it is not clear when the vote will occur since the new rules will not take effect for at least another three months. \u201cThere will be a political price to pay for those who are on the wrong side of history,\u201d Markey said.  Republicans control the Senate with 51 votes out of the 100-member body.  Senator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, said the issue was resonating with teenagers and college students. \u201cPeople are mobilizing across the country to save the free and open internet,\u201d Schatz said.

Industry sources say Airbus, which will report 2017 orders and deliveries on Jan. 15, met its target of delivering more than 700 jetliners, despite problems with Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) Geared Turbofan engines.  Airbus\u2019 total is still unlikely to match Boeing\u2019s. The European firm cut its forecast from more than 720 jets in October due to delays in engine deliveries.  Boeing\u2019s orders and deliveries confirmed the plane maker\u2019s  ability to hit rising production rates. This could mean an additional \u201c$350 million in revenues versus our forecast,\u201d said Sheila Kahyaoglu, analyst at Jefferies.  Boeing also said airlines likely will need more aircraft in 2018, keeping production rates rising.  The company expects airlines to boost passenger capacity by 5.5 percent to 6 percent this year, Randy Tinseth, Boeing vice president of marketing, said on a conference call.   With airlines already flying very full airplanes, more aircraft will be needed. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting growth to be driven by new deliveries, not by more capability out of the existing fleet,\u201d he said.  Price targets for Boeing\u2019s stock are rising. The median is now $310 a share, up from $293.50 in October. Some targets are as high as $380. Still, 12 analysts rate it a \u201chold\u201d compared with 13 with \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201cstrong buy\u201d ratings, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Meanwhile, air cargo traffic is rising, but a sustained gain could arrive too late to rescue Boeing\u2019s 747 aircraft.  Boeing has 12 backlogged orders for 747s, about two years\u2019 production. Tinseth said air cargo companies are interested.   \u201cThe question is when will they be in a position to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to make sure that (demand is) sustained.\u201d   Reporting by Alwyn Scott in New York and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Patrick Graham and Matthew Lewis"

          "body": "LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) plans to offer cities networks and technology to smooth the flow of goods and people as ride hailing and automated delivery services are making congestion worse, the U.S. automaker\u2019s top executives said on Tuesday.   In addresses at the CES technology show here, Chief Executive Jim Hackett and Marcy Klevorn, executive vice president for mobility, said Ford wants to build a \u201ctransportation mobility cloud\u201d and technology that would allow cities, fleet operators and others to use a shared platform to manage vehicles and connect people to different types of transportation.  \u201cNobody else is talking about providing an open community like this for mobility,\u201d Klevorn said. She asked CES attendees to work with Ford to develop systems to improve \u201ctransit choreography.\u201d  In a blog post, Rich Strader, Ford\u2019s vice president for Mobility Product Solutions, and Sunny Madra, CEO of Ford\u2019s software partner, Autonomic, said the common technology platform could be used to build applications or run fleets of connected vehicles.  Cities could re-route traffic away from congested streets, or make sure that self-driving cars are not cruising around searching for passengers, exacerbating traffic jams, Strader and Madra wrote.  Ride services companies and advocates of self-driving vehicles have argued that the shift away from human-driven, personal vehicles would result in less congestion. Auto industry executives talk of a world with \u201czero congestion.\u201d  A study of New York City traffic released in December concluded that 59 percent more ride hailing cars and cabs were operating in the city center in 2017 than in 2013. One-third of those vehicles were empty, according to the report by consultant Bruce Schaller, a former New York City transportation official.  New York officials are weighing various proposals to counter the trend, including assessing fees on ride services companies.

The storied Rochester, New York-based company said in a statement it is launching a cryptocurrency called \u201cKODAKCoin\u201d for photographers, part of \u201cKODAKOne\u201d, an image rights management platform launched in a licensing partnership with WENN Digital.

          "title": "Germany tells Iran not to spy against Israel on its territory",
          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has summoned Iran\u2019s ambassador to warn Tehran against spying on individuals and groups with close ties to Israel, calling such acts an unacceptable breach of German law.  The move came after the March conviction of a Pakistani man for spying for Iran in Germany went into force.  Mustufa Haidar Syed-Naqfi was convicted of gathering intelligence on Reinhold Robbe, the former head of the German-Israel Friendship Society, and an Israeli-French economics professor in Paris, for Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards.  The Foreign Ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador to deliver the rebuke once the German constitutional court rejected his appeal. The meeting took place on Dec. 22 but was not disclosed until now.   \u201cSpying on people and institutions with special ties to the state of Israel on German soil is an egregious violation of German law,\u201d a ministry official said.   The official said Philipp Ackermann, acting director of the Foreign Ministry\u2019s political section, had told the Iranian ambassador that \u201csuch activities would not be tolerated and were completely unacceptable\u201d.  The foreign ministers of Iran, Germany, France and Britain are due to meet in Brussels to discuss a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and concerns about Iran\u2019s crackdown on anti-government protesters.  Germany, which helped negotiate the nuclear deal, has sought to balance its interest in expanding trade ties with Iran with its commitment to human rights.  It has played a key role in European efforts to persuade Washington to keep the nuclear accord in place, an issue that will come up again this week, when U.S. President Donald Trump must decide whether to reimpose oil sanctions lifted under the agreement.      Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service, which handles counterespionage, highlighted Iran\u2019s spying activities in its annual report in July, saying that Tehran was focused heavily on Israeli or pro-Jewish targets.  Separately, the German federal prosecutor\u2019s office said it was examining whether charges could be brought against a senior Iranian cleric, Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the former head of Iran\u2019s justice minister, who is receiving medical treatment in the northern city of Hanover.  Volker Beck, a former Greens lawmaker, had filed a complaint against Shahroudi with prosecutors, accusing him of committing crimes against humanity.  \u201cThe complaint has been received and it is being examined,\u201d a spokesman for the prosecutor\u2019s office said. He said it was unclear how long that legal analysis would take.  Robbe said: \u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face to exiled Iranians and others to see such a former leader of the Iranian regime being treated in Germany.\u201d  Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Alison Williams"

          "title": "Trump says he would beat Oprah Winfrey in White House race",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he could beat Oprah Winfrey in a presidential race, while one of Winfrey\u2019s closest friends said the media mogul and actress was \u201cintrigued\u201d by the possibility of running but was not considering it now.  Speculation about a 2020 White House bid by Winfrey blew up on social media and news outlets after her rousing \u201cnew day\u201d speech at the Golden Globes awards show on Sunday night, which touched on female and black empowerment, her roots in poverty and support of those who speak up about sexual abuse and harassment.  But some media commentators also injected skepticism into the surge of excitement among fans of the former talk show star, saying the Democratic Party and the country might well reject the notion of another celebrity political novice following Trump\u2019s 2016 election.  Winfrey, long associated with Democratic politics and fundraising, has not commented publicly on the speculation. Known to millions by her first name, Winfrey, 63, has been a cultural force in the country for decades.  Trump, speaking with reporters during a White House meeting with lawmakers, said in response to a question, \u201cYeah I\u2019ll beat Oprah. Oprah would be a lot of fun.  \u201cI know her very well. ... I like Oprah. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to run,\u201d said the Republican president, 71.  Winfrey confidante Gayle King said earlier on Tuesday there was no change in Winfrey\u2019s past position - that she is not interested in running for president.  \u201cI do think she\u2019s intrigued by the idea, I do think that,\u201d King said on the \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d program. \u201cI also know that after years of watching \u2018The Oprah (Winfrey) Show\u2019 you always have the right to change your mind. I don\u2019t think at this point she\u2019s actually considering it.\u201d  However, CNN, citing two of Winfrey\u2019s close friends, reported on Monday that the television and movie producer and actress was actively thinking about a White House bid.  Winfrey has raised millions of dollars for various causes, including shelters for battered women but, like Trump when he launched his White House campaign, she has no prior experience in government. Trump, a businessman and former reality TV star, based part of his appeal on the fact he was truly not a Washington insider.  \u201cNOPRAH! Do we really need another celebrity president?\u201d read the front page of Tuesday\u2019s New York Post. A critique in Slate on Monday was headlined \u201cOprah? Really?,\u201d and bemoaned the \u201cimpossibly boring\u201d current crop of major political figures, making people more likely to vote for celebrities like Trump or Winfrey.  Former Trump White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who was the public face of some of the Trump administration\u2019s early missteps last year, said on the \u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d show that Winfrey lacked \u201cpolitical infrastructure\u201d and would have a hard time adjusting to the White House.  Winfrey first gained national fame with her TV talk show, which often focused on self-improvement and touched on previously taboo subjects like incest, rape, eating disorders and depression. She used the show\u2019s success to build a media empire encompassing movie production, magazines, cable TV, and satellite radio, becoming one of the world\u2019s richest women.  Winfrey also branched out into acting. She is credited with roles in nearly 30 movie and TV productions, including a role in director Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d that earned her an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.

          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. dry natural gas production was forecast to rise to an all-time high of 80.42 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2018 from 73.57 bcfd in 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration\u2019s Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO) on Tuesday.  The latest January output projection for 2018 was up from the EIA\u2019s 79.70-bcfd forecast in December and would easily top the current annual record high of 74.15 bcfd produced on average in 2015.  EIA also projected U.S. gas consumption would rise to an all-time high of 77.53 bcfd in 2018 from 74.04 bcfd in 2017.  That 2018 demand projection in the January STEO report was up from EIA\u2019s 76.85-bcfd forecast for the year in its December report and would easily top the current annual record high of 75.10 bcfd consumed on average in 2016.  Both production and consumption would jump to record highs in 2019 with output hitting 83.02 bcfd and usage reaching 79.72 bcfd, the EIA forecast.  In electric generation, the EIA projected gas would remain the primary U.S. power plant fuel in 2018 and 2019 after taking that title from coal for the first time ever in 2016. Coal had been the primary fuel for U.S. generators for the last century.  The EIA projected gas\u2019 share of generation would rise to 33.1 percent in 2018 and 34.3 percent in 2019 from 31.7 percent in 2017.  Coal\u2019s share of generation was forecast to slide to 29.6 percent in 2018 and 28.1 percent in 2019 from 30.1 percent in 2017.  Wind power capacity was expected to rise to 96 gigawatts by the end of 2018 and 104 GW by the end of 2019, from about 88 GW in 2016.  The EIA said it expected solar power capacity to rise to 50 GW by the end of 2018 and 65 GW by the end of 2019 from 43 GW in 2017.  One gigawatt is enough to power about 1 million U.S. homes.  After declining to 5,137 million tonnes in 2017, the least since 1992, the EIA projected U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would rise by 1 percent to 5,225 million tonnes in 2018 and 0.2 percent to 5,235 million tonnes in 2019 due to changes in weather, economic growth, and energy prices, the EIA said.

Harry, fifth-in-line to the throne, and actress Markle, best known for the TV legal drama \u201cSuits\u201d, announced their engagement in November, with the wedding set for May at Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Windsor Castle home to the west of London.  On their second official royal outing together, the couple were greeted by large crowds when they visited the Reprezent radio station in Brixton which was set up in 2008 as part of a response to a rise in knife crime among young people.  The station trains hundreds of young people each year in media and employment skills. It offers training in topics ranging from audio and radio production and editing to communication skills and work experience.  It also runs programs supporting youngsters with specific issues like mental health challenges, a cause dear to Harry\u2019s heart.  Presenter Gloria Beyi, 17, said the couple showed a keen interest in the station\u2019s music.  \u201cThe main thing I observed is they go quite well together,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cThis is genuine - this is real stuff. Having both of them in one room trying to talk to you and having interest in the station, how it works, the relationship between everyone, it\u2019s just so amazing.\u201d  Asked about possible wedding music recommendations, she said: \u201cA little bit of house, a little bit of hip-hop, cos Harry did say that he is interested in hip-hop and house.   \u201cSo, that mixed together at a wedding?

Kenya Power said engineers were working to identify and rectify the fault as soon as possible.  \u201cThe faulty section has been isolated and efforts to restore supply have commenced beginning with Mt.

Residents in towns far from Nairobi such as Isiolo, Nanyuki, Samburu and Eldoret reported power outages.  The company is the country\u2019s sole electricity distributor and the bulk of its power comes from Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen).  Kenya Power, which has 6.4 million customers connected to its grid, gets 60 percent of its revenues from industrial consumers in Nairobi and the neighbouring town of Thika.  While the frequency and severity of outages in Kenya has fallen over the years, many firms still run stand-by generators to cope with any supply interruptions, adding to their costs.  Kenya has an installed electricity generating capacity of 2,341 MW, most of it from geothermal and hydroelectric power.  In neighbouring Uganda, Umeme Limited said in a statement a system disturbance had also led to an outage affecting several areas, but did not give exact locations.

Amazon, the nation\u2019s largest online retailer, shook up the industry with its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods last year, prompting traditional grocery sellers to look for ways to profitably deliver fresh food and shelf-stable pantry items.  Sprouts, which delivers to homes in eight U.S. cities through a partnership with Amazon Prime Now, said it will add Instacart service to other U.S. markets, beginning with select zip codes in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona on Tuesday.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc, which sells more groceries than any other retailer, bought same-day New York City delivery company Parcel in October. It offers grocery delivery in five markets via Uber or Deliv and is testing delivery with its own trucks in Denver.  Kroger Co, the largest traditional supermarket operator, offers its own HomeShop delivery service in some markets. It also partners with Uber and Instacart for grocery delivery.  Amazon has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market, mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as pasta and diapers.

          "body": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt\u2019s President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi has won the backing of over three-quarters of parliamentarians for a second term as president, lawmakers said on Tuesday, a day after a timeline for the election was announced.  Sisi has yet to announce his candidacy for the ballot, scheduled for March 26-28. But he is widely expected to run and win the election.  The former general won a landslide victory in an election in 2014, one year after - as a military commander - he led the overthrow of elected president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood.  The election will be Egypt\u2019s third since the 2011 uprising that ended strongman Hosni Mubarak\u2019s long rule.  Election regulations stipulate that would-be candidates must obtain the backing of at least 20 members of parliament for their candidacy or must be supported by at least 25,000 eligible voters in at least 15 governorates.   So far, 464 of the 596 members of parliament have come forward to support Sisi, deputy secretary general of parliament Mohamed Nosair said. Lawmakers are not permitted to support more than one candidate.  The national election commission has said that candidates must register from Jan. 20 to 29 and that a final list of candidates will be announced on Feb. 20.]  Sisi\u2019s critics say his popularity has been dimmed by austerity reforms, security problems and a crackdown on dissidents. But few contenders have come forward in a contest that most observers expect Sisi to win easily.   Former prime minister Ahmed Shafik, who was seen as the most serious potential challenger to Sisi\u2019s rule, said on Sunday he was no longer considering running.  Another presidential hopeful, rights lawyer Khaled Ali, faces a potential three-month prison sentence for public indecency over an alleged rude hand gesture he made outside a courthouse last year. He may be disqualified from standing if he loses his appeal on March 7.  Haitham al-Hariri, leader of a leftist bloc in parliament, told Reuters that his 16-member group of lawmakers has not signed on to Sisi\u2019s nomination and remains open to backing other candidates.  \u201cThe bloc has disagreements with policies but not with people... with the current policies being followed whether economic, social or security-related policies,\u201d said Hariri.  \u201cThe bloc doesn\u2019t believe that the continuation of these policies is best for Egypt,\u201d he said.

          "body": "PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Altice founder Patrick Drahi is reshaping his telecoms and cable group for the second time in as many months by splitting its U.S. and European operations, hoping to end a drastic downward share-price spiral.  Heavily indebted Altice (ATCA.AS) said it would spin off its U.S. arm, which owns the country\u2019s fourth-biggest cable operator, to existing investors, and would prioritize efforts to turn around its European operations including French telecoms operator SFR.  Altice USA (ATUS.N) will pay a parting dividend of $1.5 billion to the European arm, to be named Altice Europe. Divestments of non-core assets, some of which are already under way, should also help to pay down debt, Altice said on Tuesday.  Analysts at brokerage Raymond James said that Altice\u2019s European arm as a whole could eventually become an acquisition target for rival French telecoms companies.  \u201cA separate listing of Altice Europe makes a sale of this asset easier, to Bouygues (BOUY.PA) or Iliad (ILD.PA) for instance, which could both consider market consolidation synergies in France, in our view,\u201d they wrote.  Altice Chief Executive Dexter Goei, however, said that was not on the horizon.  \u201cWe\u2019re very focused on the operating story, specifically in France and Portugal,\u201d Goei told reporters during a call. \u201cOver the medium and longer term, I\u2019m certain this question will be asked again and maybe we\u2019ll have a different response.\u201d  Altice\u2019s shares in Europe (ATCA.AS) closed 10.5 percent higher, partially offsetting their fall of about 50 percent in the past 12 months. Altice USA had jumped by more than 15 percent by 1708 GMT.  The group\u2019s leveraged loans also rebounded strongly in Europe\u2019s secondary loan market.    The two companies will be led by separate management teams with Franco-Israeli billionaire Drahi retaining control of both and garnering a large share of the dividend as well as of a $2 billion share buyback planned by Altice USA.  Dennis Okhuijsen, Altice\u2019s current chief financial officer, will become CEO of Altice Europe and Dexter Goei will continue to serve as chief executive of Altice USA.  No new executive recruitment was announced, however, with Altice remaining managed by the same close team that has seen it transform from a small France-based company into a global group.   Several analysts said that this light and centralized top management may hamper Altice\u2019s capacity to define an efficient and clear marketing strategy in each of its markets.  Altice, whose operations stretch from Israel to the Dominican Republic, saw its shares plummet after a financial report signaled it would fail to grow in France in 2017, despite large investments in mobile and fixed networks.  This led to the ousting of Altice\u2019s chief executive, a rare apology by Drahi to investors at a conference last year and the promise that Altice, whose debt equals more than twice its yearly revenues, would shift focus from large acquisitions to sales growth and debt management.  Altice has grown rapidly through acquisitions in the United States and Europe, helped by cheap debt that has risen to around $60 billion \u2014 more than five times its annual core operating profit.  In the United States, Drahi spent $28 billion in 2015 to buy cable companies Suddenlink and Cablevision, and even flirted with a $185 billion bid for cable giant Charter (CHTR.O).  The company largely fulfilled its promise to cut costs aggressively at the businesses it bought but often failed to achieve the operational turnarounds and growth it targeted.  Altice NV, which is based in the Netherlands, aims to complete the spinoff of its 67.2 percent interest in Altice USA by the end of the second quarter, following regulatory and shareholder approvals.  The listed U.S. business, no longer owned by Altice NV, will then be shielded from concerns about the European operations, while its liquidity will quadruple to 42 percent of total shares outstanding.  \u201cWith U.S. activities clearly split, the contagion effect will not be felt,\u201d said Thomas Coudry, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co.  Drahi will own 52 percent of Altice Europe and 43 percent of Altice USA.  Altice\u2019s managers had in the past said that potential risks associated with the company\u2019s consolidated debt were alleviated by the so-called \u201csilo structure\u201d of the group, under which each entity would have to make its own repayments.   Drahi has recently shifted gears, saying there was a path to further strengthen the European balance sheet over the long term through non-core asset disposals, such as telecom towers.  Altice is also hoping to raise as much as 3 billion euros from the sale of its Dominican Republic business, sources told Reuters in November.

          "body": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Prices in Venezuela, which is believed to have the world\u2019s highest inflation, jumped 2,616 percent last year, the country\u2019s opposition-led National Assembly said, as millions suffer from food and medicine shortages during a severe economic crisis.      Opposition politicians, whose numbers are broadly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates, on Monday put December\u2019s inflation figure alone at 85 percent, well into hyperinflation territory for which the benchmark is usually 50 percent.      \u201cInflation in December alone is greater than accumulated inflation (over the whole year) for all of Latin America,\u201d said lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Guerra.  Venezuelan authorities did not respond to a request for comment.       The country\u2019s minimum wage went up 40 percent in January but still is worth just over $2 per month on the black market exchange, where the bolivar currency has weakened about 35 percent against the dollar in the last month alone.    Hundreds of people mobbed some supermarkets on Saturday after authorities promised price cuts.      The central bank has not published inflation or gross domestic product data for two years. However, the money supply expanded by more than 1,000 percent last year.  President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro says the problems stem from the \u201ceconomic war\u201d waged by Washington and the opposition against his government.

Stocks continued their winning streak in 2018 as investors remained hopeful about global economic growth and tax-cut led gains for corporate earnings in a low interest rate environment.  \u201cSo long as inflation remains at around these levels, it will certainly support the mutiples that we have,\u201d said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for The Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank.  \u201cWe\u2019ll watch inflation to see if that unexpectedly rises and could cause some concerns about earnings compression.\u201d  After a lukewarm December jobs report, investors will look for fresh signs of pickup in inflation from the monthly consumer price data due on Friday.

Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an 8 percent increase a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  A handful of retailers including Target, Kohl\u2019s Corp and Lululemon Athletica have already reported solid rise in same-store sales for the holiday period and raised their profit forecasts for the fourth quarter.  Boeing jumped 2.4 percent, lifting the Dow the most, after the company said it delivered 763 jetliners in 2017, likely retaining the title of the world\u2019s biggest plane maker.  A 2 percent rise in Johnson & Johnson and a 6.4 percent jump in Boston Scientific helped the S&P health sector gain 1.03 percent.  Bank of America and Goldman Sachs rose more than 1 percent, tracking a rise in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which hit a 10-month high after the Bank of Japan said it would trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds.  The interest-rate sensitive utilities and real estate fell about 0.9 percent.  Technology stocks were lower, led by Intel\u2019s 1.8 percent drop. Performance of the systems running on the chipmaker\u2019s processors decreased after Microsoft Corp released patches against security threats.  Advanced Micro Devices slipped 3.5 percent after Microsoft suspended patches for computers running AMD chipsets after complaints that the updates froze their machines.

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul should accelerate major acquisitions by drugmakers in 2018 after a slow year for deals in 2017, according to senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers.  The $1.5-trillion bill, which U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law in December, lowers the income tax rate for U.S. companies to 21 percent from 35 percent, encourages them to repatriate cash, and modifies numerous deductions.  Brent Saunders, chief executive officer of Allergan Inc, expects tax reform to finally clear the decks for big industry consolidation. Such moves will likely materialize over months\u00a0as companies study the new bill and devise appropriate strategies.\u00a0  In the first half of the year, he expects to see more oncology deals like the one Celgene Corp announced\u00a0on Sunday, a smaller acquisition of cancer drug developer Impact Biomedicines.   Bigger, transformative deals - like the ones where large-cap pharmaceutical companies consolidate with rivals and biotechnology players - will likely take longer, bankers said.   \u201cI think the industry ultimately consolidates,\u201d Saunders said in an interview at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. \u201cI have a sense, though, in terms of a bigger wave of (mergers), it will either happen in the back half of 2018 or in 2019.\u201d  The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has been consolidating for years even without tax reform. Large companies like Merck & Co Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Johnson & Johnson regularly buy or do licensing deals with small companies to help maintain a continuous pipeline of new medicines.   But large-scale deals \u2013 like Merck\u2019s $41.1-billion acquisition of Schering Plough in 2009, or Pfizer Inc\u2019s $68-billion purchase of Wyeth \u2013 have dried up.\u00a0  In early 2016, the Obama administration introduced rules that would punish companies for so-called inversion deals, in which a U.S.-based acquirer bought a smaller firm overseas and moved the combined corporate headquarters abroad to benefit from lower tax rates. The move scuttled Pfizer Inc\u2019s proposed $160-billion purchase of Dublin-based Allergan.  Saunders said Allergan would only begin to look at smaller deals in the second half of the year as the company, known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment, as it is currently focused on cost cutting.  Saunders\u2019 comments echo those of healthcare industry bankers, who say that uncertainty around the tax bill, drug pricing and Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare had cooled merger activity in 2017.\u00a0  Now that the tax law is in place, these bankers say, it should provide a catalyst to drugmaker deals by allowing them to repatriate billions of dollars in foreign profits held abroad, and by making it easier to agree on a value for their acquisition targets since they have a better idea of the company\u2019s tax rate.   Several drugmakers have already announced plans to bring overseas cash into the United States, including Amgen Inc and Bristol-Myers, incurring some short-term charges.  Horizon Pharma CEO Tim Walbert said that when larger companies benefit from that repatriation of cash, they are likely to lift the whole market.  \u201cTo the extent that you see acceleration of large cap deals ... that will bring more confidence in the sector and allow for more strategic opportunities for everyone,\u201d Walbert said.  Horizon does not have substantial money parked overseas, and expects to continue its current strategy of small- and medium-sized acquisitions for drugs treating rare diseases, its primary focus.  Drug industry deals have been trending lower for the past two years. Thomson Reuters data shows that in 2017, there were $52 billion worth of pharma and biotech deals, less than 25 percent of 2015\u2019s $212 billion in deals and down from 2016\u2019s $54 billion.   Johnson & Johnson Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said during a conference session that one reason deals were not getting done was that companies needed to borrow money in the United States, and because it was difficult to structure a deal with low enough taxes.  And Eli Lilly & Co CEO Dave Ricks said that among the uses for cash it repatriates - it has $10 billion overseas - would be more business development including the small, early-stage mergers and acquisitions that are typical of the Indianapolis-based drugmaker.  Merck said that tax reform could spur large deals among companies that are focused on general cost savings. However, that is not Merck\u2019s deal focus: CFO Robert Davis said the company will continue to seek smaller acquisitions to enhance its portfolio of medicines.  \u201cThat being said, getting access now to foreign cash, in a way where you don\u2019t have to worry about the location of the cash will improve our flexibility,\u201d\u00a0 he said.  \u201cWe\u2019re not planning a large one-time repatriation. We will repatriate in a normal course as we see what the needs are for the business.\u201d  Reporting by Caroline Humer and Carl O'Donnell; Editing by Nick Zieminski"

          "body": "* Supreme Court ruled against nationalisation in December  * MCC says decision sends negative signal to foreign investors  By Barbara Lewis and Terrence Edwards  LONDON/ULAANBAATAR, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Mongolian Copper Corporation (MCC) said on Tuesday it will fight a decision by the Mongolian government to repurchase its stake in one of Asia\u2019s biggest copper mines for about $400 million after a failed attempt to nationalise it.  Earlier on Tuesday, the government passed a resolution to buy the 49 percent holding, giving Mongolia full state control of the Erdenet mine, following a ruling by the country\u2019s Supreme Court in December against the nationalisation decided by parliament in February 2017.  MCC said no agreement had been reached with the government and it would fight the decision legally.  \u201cWe will protect our legal ownership rights locally and internationally,\u201d MCC\u2019s Chairman Munkhbaatar Myagmar told Reuters on Tuesday in London. He was is in the city for talks with law firm Omnia Strategy, which is representing the company.  The signal Mongolia\u2019s government was giving to potential foreign investors, which can help it meet the terms of an IMF bailout agreed last year, was negative, he said.  \u201cIf this kind of thing happens again, no-one will come to Mongolia,\u201d he said.  Erdenet is one of the region\u2019s largest copper mines, producing 530,000 tonnes of copper concentrate annually.  Mongolia\u2019s proximity to neighbouring China, the world\u2019s biggest copper consumer, has attracted interest from Chilean state-owned company Codelco, the biggest copper-producing company.  Major miner Rio Tinto  is already present in Mongolia, where it is working on a massive underground extension at copper mine Oyu Tolgoi.  Oyu Tolgoi is jointly owned by the government of Mongolia (34 percent) and Turquoise Hill Resources (66 percent), which in turn is 51 percent-owned by mine operator Rio Tinto.  MCC purchased the Erdenet mine from Russia in 2016, with the approval of then prime minister Chimed Saikhanbileg.  The parliament later nationalised the mine, saying it had never endorsed the sale.  MCC says its purchase was legal and the government\u2019s dismissal of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, which upheld an earlier court ruling, was unconstitutional.  It also argues the company will be run more efficiently under private management and says it is a big tax payer to the Mongolian government, paying around $100 million in tax in the first half of last year.  No-one from the Mongolian government was immediately available to comment on Tuesday.  In a statement last week before Tuesday\u2019s government resolution formalised the repurchase, it said MCC would be compensated by the just over $400 million it said the company paid to Russia to acquire the stake.

The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday, also found that layoffs dropped to a six-month low, however, showing continued labor market strength.  Job openings, a measure of labor demand, fell by 46,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.88 million, the lowest level since May. The job openings rate was 3.8 percent, a decline from October\u2019s 3.9 percent.  \u201cThe recent declines followed a sharp run up over the first three quarters of 2017,\u201d said Sarah House, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. \u201cIf sustained, this suggests a more moderate pace of hiring ahead.\u201d  Hiring dropped 104,000 to 5.49 million in November, and the hiring rate dipped to 3.7 percent from 3.8 percent. Economists expect job growth this year to slow to well below the 2017 monthly average of 170,000 as the labor market hits full employment.   The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent and economists expect it to drop to 3.5 percent by the end of 2018. Non-farm payrolls rose 148,000 in December.  \u201cLike the recent readings on payrolls and initial claims, we see some moderation in the labor market data off of strong levels,\u201d said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York.  There were 378,000 job openings in manufacturing in November, down from 409,000 in October. The transportation, warehousing, and utilities sector saw a 60,000 drop in job openings. There was a 39,000 decline in job openings in the real estate and rental and leasing sector.  But job openings in the troubled retail sector increased 88,000 in November. The sector lost 67,000 jobs in 2017 as retailers, reeling from stiff competition from online sellers like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), closed stores.      The JOLTS report also showed layoffs decreasing 7,000 to 1.67 million in November. That was the lowest level since May and marked five straight months of declines.   There was a slight drop in the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs, leaving the quits rate unchanged at 2.2 percent for a third straight month. The Federal Reserve looks at the quits rate as a measure of job market confidence.  \u201cThe low turnover rates indicate that there is less movement in the labor market than at other times when we\u2019ve had very low unemployment,\u201d said Cathy Barrera, chief economist at   ZipRecruiter. \u201cIt is great for the labor market to be near full employment, but if workers are staying put, then there is little pressure for employers to raise wages.\u201d  Reporting By Lucia Mutikani, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien"

          "body": "MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose for a fourth straight session on Tuesday, lifted by strength among cyclical stocks and optimism about further growth in company earnings.  Expectations of possible dealmaking in the auto industry and a weaker euro EUR= also helped, pushing the STOXX 600  up 0.4 percent at 400 points, its highest since August 2015 and just a few points below its all-time peak of 414.   The rise came as a global stock benchmark .MIWD00000PUS touched another record high with confidence in another strong earning season offsetting worries over valuations becoming too elevated.  \u201cIf growth does not disappoint and companies deliver solid earnings, I don\u2019t see risk on valuation,\u201d said Valentin Bissat, equities strategist at Mirabaud Asset Management.      According to Citi, global earnings revisions were positive for the 14th week in a row, recording the best weekly upgrades since its data started in 2000, led by cyclicals.  Even though high earning revisions are usually seen at the start or end of the economic or market cycle, strategists at the U.S. bank said it was too early to call the end of this cycle.  Top gainer on the STOXX on Tuesday was Altice (ATCA.AS).   Its shares rose 10.5 percent as investors welcomed a decision to spin off its U.S. unit and simplify the indebted  telecoms and cable firm\u2019s structure.   Traders said any move to reduce debt would be well received by the market, and analysts at brokerage Raymond James said the move could also make the Altice European arm a possible acquisition target for rival French telecoms companies.   Auto stocks .SXAP cemented their position as the biggest sectoral gainer so far this year, rising 1.4 percent.  Continental (CONG.DE) rose 5.4 percent on expectations of a possible corporate overhaul.  Continental is still looking at its corporate structure as part of a review launched more than a year ago, a source close to the matter said on Tuesday following a media report about a possible breakup of the car parts maker.  Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) rose to another record high, up 2 percent. Traders cited continued talk the carmaker could look at strategic deals such as spin-offs and disposals in the last year with CEO Sergio Marchionne at the helm at the company.  Commodities also continued their climb, with stronger metals prices helping the STOXX 600 materials index .SXPP rise 1.2 percent to hit its highest since March 2012.  Financials provided the biggest boost to the STOXX as optimism over Europe\u2019s economic growth prevailed.  \u201cIn an environment of solid growth and rising long-term yields in Europe, financials and value stocks in general are likely to outperform, as well as energy,\u201d said Mirabaud\u2019s Bissat, who is overweight on financials stocks.   Elsewhere among cyclicals, Germany\u2019s Siemens (SIEGn.DE) rose 0.5 percent after its industrial production and exports rose more than expected in November.    Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (SNHG.DE) fell 5.4 percent after the ECB sold its Steinhoff bond at a loss as the company grapples with an accounting scandal.  Morrisons (MRW.L), up 2.4 percent, was among top gainers after the UK retailer reported a stronger than anticipated Christmas trading season. Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) also gained.

          "title": "U.S. doctors not certain all kids need scoliosis screening",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - It\u2019s unclear if all children and teens can benefit from routine screening for scoliosis, according to a new statement from a panel of U.S. medical experts.   Even though wearing a back brace may stop scoliosis from getting worse, it\u2019s not clear whether this treatment has long-term benefits for youngsters without obvious symptoms who are identified with scoliosis through routine screening, said Dr. Alex Kemper, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a government-backed independent panel of physicians and health specialists.   There isn\u2019t enough evidence yet to say whether treating scoliosis because of an abnormal screen leads to improvements in health that last into adulthood, Kemper, a researcher at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, said by email.   The USPSTF statement doesn\u2019t apply to youth who have visible curvature in their spine or other, more subtle hallmarks of scoliosis such as slight misalignments around the shoulders, hips or rib cage.   When the Task Force last weighed in on this issue in 2004, the expert panel recommended against routine scoliosis screening out of concern that patients might be harmed by unnecessary treatment.   Since then, more research has emerged showing the benefits of early treatment with a back brace, the Task Force notes in its guidelines published in JAMA.   In particular, one experiment with 242 young scoliosis patients found wearing a back brace at least 18 hours a day is more effective than observation for preventing curvatures from worsening.   This study helped sway other medical societies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, to formally recommend routine screening in 2015, said Dr. Timothy Hresko, author of an editorial in JAMA Pediatrics accompanying the new USPSTF statement.   \u201cWith the value of bracing now confirmed, the results of this study emphasized the need for early detection of scoliosis so that brace treatment can be offered to patients,\u201d said Hresko, an orthopedic surgery researcher at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.   Access to quality screening remains a concern, however, Hresko said by email.    Screening is usually done by looking for curves along the spine as well as asymmetry around the back, shoulders and hips. Patients who appear to have scoliosis with screening may have the diagnosis confirmed with x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging.   Even though there aren\u2019t any obvious harms or side effects from the screening itself, children might suffer psychological distress if they are inaccurately told they have scoliosis based on screening, and they might also suffer needless testing and treatment, the Task Force notes.   Long-term studies also haven\u2019t proven how much routine screening can help reduce the number of adults with scoliosis who suffer from breathing problems, back pain, disability or reduced quality of life, the Task Force points out.   Parents should still see a doctor if they\u2019re concerned that their child might have scoliosis, said Dr. John Francis Sarwark, author of an accompanying editorial in JAMA and a researcher at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago.  \u201cKeep in mind that most children do not require treatment for normal findings, minor findings or mild scoliosis,\u201d Sarwark advised.

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) said it planned to boost the number of planes it makes in China under a deal signed in Beijing on Tuesday to expand co-operation at its Tianjin assembly plant.  The provisional deal was signed during a state visit to China by French President Emmanuel Macron.  Airbus said the latest Tianjin agreement would result in production increasing to six aircraft per month - up from four at present - at the local final assembly line for the Airbus A320-family of jets.  The industrial ramp-up will target five aircraft by early 2019 and six per month by early 2020, it added in a statement.  A Beijing signing ceremony did not, however, include any deal for Airbus to sell aircraft to China, despite earlier expectations of a contract timed to coincide with Macron\u2019s visit.  Industry sources had said Airbus was negotiating to sell around 100 planes to China\u2019s state purchasing agency, though a deal had not been flagged as part of the diplomatic preparations for the visit.  New orders for Airbus jetliners have historically featured during such state visits by French leaders.  China regularly splits large orders between Europe and the United States to cope with its fast-expanding airline traffic, but the momentum has recently been with rival Boeing (BA.N), which sold 300 jets during a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump last year.  China, however, placed a large order for 140 Airbus jets during a visit to Germany by President Xi Jinping last July.  Some sources say Chinese officials are disappointed about a deal last year for Airbus to buy the CSeries jet project from Bombardier (BBDb.TO), derailing talks with Chinese investors after Ottawa intervened to keep the struggling program in Western hands.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Rising demand for jet sales pushed Boeing Co\u2019s (BA.N) stock to the top of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2017, and record cash flow to fuel projects, sustain dividends and buy back shares could give it another bumper year, analysts said.  After a resurgence in jet sales driven by a solid global economy and with most of its production issues behind it, Boeing has found itself flush with record free cash flow - a profitability measure widely watched by investors for industrial stocks.  \u201cWe believe Boeing shares are still moderately undervalued, particularly if the company can sustain free cash flow margins in the 13-15 percent range,\u201d Fort Pitt Capital Group founder Charles Smith told Reuters.  \u201cGiven our expectations for moderation in capex over the next couple years, along with continued efficiencies on the 787 Dreamliner, we think this can happen,\u201d said Smith, whose funds held a 0.04 percent stake in Boeing as of Sept. 30, according to Reuters data.  Smith said Boeing\u2019s third quarter free cash flow margin was 12.45 percent.  The company has increased its free cash flow from $1.83 billion in 2010 to an estimated $10.5 billion in 2017. That figure would be an increase of 34 percent from 2016.  The surge in cash flow has energized the company\u2019s shares, pushing up the stock price by more than 90 percent in 2017. Still, the stock trades at a slight discount to its aerospace peers. .DJUSAS  Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said if management executes on another year of growth, tax reform materializes and free cash flow multiples catch up with peers, one can expect \u201canother +50 percent year.\u201d  Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg recently confirmed that the company expects to grow operating cash flow annually through the end of the decade, adding that it remains committed to returning about 100 percent of free cash flow to investors.  Free cash flow points to a company\u2019s ability to expand production, develop new products, make acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt.  Boeing last month raised its quarterly dividend by 20 percent and replaced its existing $14 billion share buyback plan with a new $18 billion authorization.  Since the end of 2012, the world\u2019s biggest airplane producer has pumped back nearly $40 billion to its investors through dividend and share repurchases while still investing substantially in products, services and people.  Fort Pitt\u2019s Smith says Boeing\u2019s management is doing well allocating capital between new projects, acquisitions and buybacks and predicts a return on shareholder equity of 17-18 percent that gives shares a \u201cfair value\u201d estimate for 2018 of $300 to $360.  Boeing\u2019s shares were trading up 1 percent at $313.75 on Tuesday.  The company, however, has to overcome near-term challenges like its troubled aerial tanker refueling program and longer term concerns such as macroeconomic issues and possible supply chain problems, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Lalwani said.  But for now the stock remains popular among investors, with 13 out of 25 analysts rating it a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201cstrong buy\u201d.  \u201cIt\u2019s a bull market and Boeing is a classic kind of late stage bull market stock - mega cap, high quality, global orientation,\u201d said Kenneth Fisher, whose asset management firm owned about $70 million of Boeing stock as of Oct. 17.  Boeing said in September it will raise production of 787 Dreamliner jets to 14 a month in 2019 from 12 currently, indicating reviving faith in wide-body demand.  On Tuesday, Boeing said it delivered 763 jetliners in 2017, likely retaining the title of the world\u2019s biggest plane maker compared with European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA).

          "body": "DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Democratic Republic of Congo is racing to contain a cholera outbreak that has swept through villages ravaged by conflict and is now spreading quickly in the overcrowded capital, officials and health workers said on Tuesday.  Cholera outbreaks occur regularly in the vast Central African country but this is the worst in more than 20 years, said Didier Bompangue, government coordinator for the elimination of cholera.   The disease has killed at least 1,190 people and spread to 24 of the country\u2019s 26 provinces since it broke out in July, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in a briefing. About 55,000 cases have been recorded.   Congo\u2019s main concern now is for the capital Kinshasa, a city of 12 million people with poor sanitation and lack of access to drinking water that facilitates the spread of the water-borne disease, Bompangue told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   \u201cOn a national level, the situation is improving. If there is one place that worries us it\u2019s Kinshasa,\u201d Bompangue said.  The disease has killed 28 people and infected 411 in Kinshasa since the end of November, he said. The government has opened free treatment centers throughout the city, but patients must be isolated quickly or it will continue to spread.  \u201cThe numbers are going up very quickly (in Kinshasa),\u201d said Caroline Holmgren, country representative for medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).  Yet many people are also dying in rural areas where health centers have been destroyed by conflict and patients lack access to basic treatment, aid agencies said.  Most people recover from cholera if treated promptly with oral rehydration salts, but can die within hours if not.  About 60 percent of health facilities in the central Kasai region are not functioning since fighting broke out between government forces and local militia there in 2016, said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).  The case fatality rate in the region is 14.5 percent compared to 2.1 percent nationally, according to WHO.   \u201cThe medicine is not expensive. It\u2019s lack of access,\u201d said IFRC\u2019s Africa director Fatoumata Nafo-Traore.  \u201cCholera is preventable, it can be cured. We don\u2019t need this type of crisis,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

A tweak to the Bank of Japan\u2019s bond-buying program shunted the yen higher, while the dollar climbed against a basket of major currencies, recovering further from last week\u2019s decline to its lowest in more than three months.  Wall Street\u2019s main indexes hit record highs at the open, extending a winning streak since the start of 2018. MSCI\u2019s all-country world stocks index also posted another record high.  U.S. stock investors remain upbeat about fourth-quarter earnings season, which begins on Friday with results from JPMorgan Chase, with the focus expected to be on any comments related to the just-approved U.S. tax overhaul that includes hefty corporate tax cuts.  Citi analysts say global earnings revisions have now been upgraded for 14 weeks in a row, the best run of weekly upgrades since their data series started in 2000.  \u201cAcross the board, we\u2019re positive about fourth quarter and the next few quarters. But it could be a little bit noisy after we got the tax reform law passed and companies make some adjustments close to year-end,\u201d said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for The Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 115.62 points, or 0.46 percent, to 25,398.62, the S&P 500 gained 8.11 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,755.82 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.77 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,169.15.  The S&P 500 has been up every day so far in the new year, providing more optimism on the outlook for the rest of the year.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.44 percent and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18 percent.  Oil prices rose, touching their highest since December 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for an eighth week.  U.S. crude rose 1.51 percent to $62.66 per barrel and Brent was last at $68.53, up 1.11 percent on the day.  The dollar rose against most other major currencies including the euro, which having approached three-year highs last week, slipped.  The dollar fell against the yen after the Bank of Japan trimmed its purchases of long-dated government bonds in market operations, stoking speculation the central bank could start to wind down its huge stimulus policy this year.  The dollar index rose 0.26 percent, with the euro down 0.37 percent to $1.1921.  The Japanese yen strengthened 0.39 percent versus the greenback at 112.65 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3526, down 0.29 percent on the day.  Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year government notes hit a 10-month high after the Bank of Japan move.  Ten-year notes last fell 16/32 in price to yield 2.5402 percent, from 2.482 percent late on Monday.

          "title": "European shares at fresh highs on earning optimism, dealmaking",
          "body": "MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose for a fourth straight session on Tuesday, lifted by strength among cyclical stocks and optimism about further growth in company earnings.  Expectations of possible dealmaking in the auto industry and a weaker euro EUR= also helped, pushing the STOXX 600  up 0.4 percent at 400 points, its highest since August 2015 and just a few points below its all-time peak of 414.   The rise came as a global stock benchmark .MIWD00000PUS touched another record high with confidence in another strong earning season offsetting worries over valuations becoming too elevated.  \u201cIf growth does not disappoint and companies deliver solid earnings, I don\u2019t see risk on valuation,\u201d said Valentin Bissat, equities strategist at Mirabaud Asset Management.      According to Citi, global earnings revisions were positive for the 14th week in a row, recording the best weekly upgrades since its data started in 2000, led by cyclicals.  Even though high earning revisions are usually seen at the start or end of the economic or market cycle, strategists at the U.S. bank said it was too early to call the end of this cycle.  Top gainer on the STOXX on Tuesday was Altice (ATCA.AS).   Its shares rose 10.5 percent as investors welcomed a decision to spin off its U.S. unit and simplify the indebted  telecoms and cable firm\u2019s structure.   Traders said any move to reduce debt would be well received by the market, and analysts at brokerage Raymond James said the move could also make the Altice European arm a possible acquisition target for rival French telecoms companies.   Auto stocks .SXAP cemented their position as the biggest sectoral gainer so far this year, rising 1.4 percent.  Continental (CONG.DE) rose 5.4 percent on expectations of a possible corporate overhaul.  Continental is still looking at its corporate structure as part of a review launched more than a year ago, a source close to the matter said on Tuesday following a media report about a possible breakup of the car parts maker.  Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) rose to another record high, up 2 percent. Traders cited continued talk the carmaker could look at strategic deals such as spin-offs and disposals in the last year with CEO Sergio Marchionne at the helm at the company.  Commodities also continued their climb, with stronger metals prices helping the STOXX 600 materials index .SXPP rise 1.2 percent to hit its highest since March 2012.  Financials provided the biggest boost to the STOXX as optimism over Europe\u2019s economic growth prevailed.  \u201cIn an environment of solid growth and rising long-term yields in Europe, financials and value stocks in general are likely to outperform, as well as energy,\u201d said Mirabaud\u2019s Bissat, who is overweight on financials stocks.   Elsewhere among cyclicals, Germany\u2019s Siemens (SIEGn.DE) rose 0.5 percent after its industrial production and exports rose more than expected in November.    Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (SNHG.DE) fell 5.4 percent after the ECB sold its Steinhoff bond at a loss as the company grapples with an accounting scandal.  Morrisons (MRW.L), up 2.4 percent, was among top gainers after the UK retailer reported a stronger than anticipated Christmas trading season. Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) also gained.

          "title": "Drahi hits Altice reset button to court wary investors",
          "body": "PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Altice founder Patrick Drahi is reshaping his telecoms and cable group for the second time in as many months by splitting its U.S. and European operations, hoping to end a drastic downward share-price spiral.  Heavily indebted Altice (ATCA.AS) said it would spin off its U.S. arm, which owns the country\u2019s fourth-biggest cable operator, to existing investors, and would prioritize efforts to turn around its European operations including French telecoms operator SFR.  Altice USA (ATUS.N) will pay a parting dividend of $1.5 billion to the European arm, to be named Altice Europe. Divestments of non-core assets, some of which are already under way, should also help to pay down debt, Altice said on Tuesday.  Analysts at brokerage Raymond James said that Altice\u2019s European arm as a whole could eventually become an acquisition target for rival French telecoms companies.  \u201cA separate listing of Altice Europe makes a sale of this asset easier, to Bouygues (BOUY.PA) or Iliad (ILD.PA) for instance, which could both consider market consolidation synergies in France, in our view,\u201d they wrote.  Altice Chief Executive Dexter Goei, however, said that was not on the horizon.  \u201cWe\u2019re very focused on the operating story, specifically in France and Portugal,\u201d Goei told reporters during a call. \u201cOver the medium and longer term, I\u2019m certain this question will be asked again and maybe we\u2019ll have a different response.\u201d  Altice\u2019s shares in Europe (ATCA.AS) closed 10.5 percent higher, partially offsetting their fall of about 50 percent in the past 12 months. Altice USA had jumped by more than 15 percent by 1708 GMT.  The group\u2019s leveraged loans also rebounded strongly in Europe\u2019s secondary loan market.    The two companies will be led by separate management teams with Franco-Israeli billionaire Drahi retaining control of both and garnering a large share of the dividend as well as of a $2 billion share buyback planned by Altice USA.  Dennis Okhuijsen, Altice\u2019s current chief financial officer, will become CEO of Altice Europe and Dexter Goei will continue to serve as chief executive of Altice USA.  No new executive recruitment was announced, however, with Altice remaining managed by the same close team that has seen it transform from a small France-based company into a global group.   Several analysts said that this light and centralized top management may hamper Altice\u2019s capacity to define an efficient and clear marketing strategy in each of its markets.  Altice, whose operations stretch from Israel to the Dominican Republic, saw its shares plummet after a financial report signaled it would fail to grow in France in 2017, despite large investments in mobile and fixed networks.  This led to the ousting of Altice\u2019s chief executive, a rare apology by Drahi to investors at a conference last year and the promise that Altice, whose debt equals more than twice its yearly revenues, would shift focus from large acquisitions to sales growth and debt management.  Altice has grown rapidly through acquisitions in the United States and Europe, helped by cheap debt that has risen to around $60 billion \u2014 more than five times its annual core operating profit.  In the United States, Drahi spent $28 billion in 2015 to buy cable companies Suddenlink and Cablevision, and even flirted with a $185 billion bid for cable giant Charter (CHTR.O).  The company largely fulfilled its promise to cut costs aggressively at the businesses it bought but often failed to achieve the operational turnarounds and growth it targeted.  Altice NV, which is based in the Netherlands, aims to complete the spinoff of its 67.2 percent interest in Altice USA by the end of the second quarter, following regulatory and shareholder approvals.  The listed U.S. business, no longer owned by Altice NV, will then be shielded from concerns about the European operations, while its liquidity will quadruple to 42 percent of total shares outstanding.  \u201cWith U.S. activities clearly split, the contagion effect will not be felt,\u201d said Thomas Coudry, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co.  Drahi will own 52 percent of Altice Europe and 43 percent of Altice USA.  Altice\u2019s managers had in the past said that potential risks associated with the company\u2019s consolidated debt were alleviated by the so-called \u201csilo structure\u201d of the group, under which each entity would have to make its own repayments.   Drahi has recently shifted gears, saying there was a path to further strengthen the European balance sheet over the long term through non-core asset disposals, such as telecom towers.  Altice is also hoping to raise as much as 3 billion euros from the sale of its Dominican Republic business, sources told Reuters in November.

          "title": "Berlusconi says Italy can't leave euro; coalition ally disagrees",
          "body": "ROME (Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi said on Tuesday that Italy must not leave the euro but his main coalition partner immediately disagreed, underlining policy differences in the centre-right bloc which is expected to take most seats in an election in March.   Berlusconi said in a radio interview that leaving the single currency would hurt Italy\u2019s economy and added that his main ally, the eurosceptic Northern League, now shared his view.  But the League\u2019s economics spokesman Claudio Borghi shot back that if the centre-right won the March 4 election it would immediately prepare for Italy to exit the euro, which many Italians blame for years of economic underperformance.  The conservative alliance, which also includes the far-right Brothers of Italy party, is projected to win most seats at the election but to fall short of an absolute majority.  The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is the most popular single party, has steadily rowed back on its previously eurosceptic stance and its leader said on Tuesday that leaving the single currency was no longer a party policy.   In an interview with Radio Capital, Berlusconi - whose Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party is the lynchpin of the centre-right coalition - said he spoke on behalf of League leader, Matteo Salvini, who has given mixed signals on the euro.  \u201cSalvini is no longer of the idea that we should leave the euro,\u201d Berlusconi said. \u201cHe has understood that it would be technically impossible and unsustainable for our economy.\u201d  The League has softened its anti-euro rhetoric recently but 81-year-old Berlusconi, who has often in the past claimed to speak on behalf of others, may have been overstating the change of tone in an effort to reassure moderate voters.  Shortly afterwards Borghi gave a very different view of the League\u2019s position in a television interview.  \u201cOne second after the League is in government it will begin all possible preparations to arrive at our monetary sovereignty. It\u2019s a question of national security,\u201d he said.  Despite Borghi\u2019s words, an exit from the euro did not feature among a list of vague policy priorities agreed by the centre-right parties at a meeting on Sunday.   Berlusconi has called for Italy to operate with two currencies, keeping the euro for international trade and tourism while printing its old lira currency for domestic use.   The prospect that eurosceptic parties could try to pull Italy out of the single currency worries financial markets, although euro exit is not a prominent theme in the election campaign.   As the Northern League has scaled back its anti-euro rhetoric, 5-Star has also watered down a previous commitment to hold a referendum on the euro as it seeks to reassure voters and investors that it can be trusted with power.  \u201cI believe it is no longer the right moment for Italy to leave the euro,\u201d Di Maio said in an interview on Tuesday with state television company RAI. \u201cThe referendum is a last resort which I hope to avoid,\u201d he added.  Di Maio has previously said that 5-Star will only pursue a referendum on the euro if it is unable to win any concessions from its partners to soften euro zone fiscal rules.  The 31-year-old party leader confirmed on Tuesday that 5-Star would raise the budget deficit above the EU\u2019s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in order to increase public investment in infrastructure.  He also said he wanted to renegotiate current EU rules on banks\u2019 capital requirements which he said were choking off the flow of credit to Italian companies.  additional reporting by Philip Pullella and Massimiliano di Giorgio; Editing by Richard Balmforth and Crispian Balmer"

          "body": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The Swedish ambassador to the United Nations said on Tuesday he is concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s plans to review funding for a humanitarian agency that provides aid to Palestinian refugees.  \u201cMy concern (is) that as we talk about region stability, withdrawing funding for UNRWA would be very negative both in terms of humanitarian needs of over 5 million people but also of course it would be destabilizing for the region,\u201d Olof Skoog said, referring to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.  The United States is the largest donor to UNRWA, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to the organization\u2019s website.  Last Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the United States may withhold future aid payments to Palestinians, accusing them of being unwilling to talk peace with Israel. Earlier, his U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the future U.S. funding for UNRWA was under review.  A State Department official later said that no decision had been made on payment.  \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to sort out what the exact information is on that,\u201d Skoog said on Tuesday, adding that he has brought the subject up bilaterally with Haley.  Relations between the Palestinians and Washington soured last month after Trump announced the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, generating outrage across the Arab world and concern among Washington\u2019s Western allies.  Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Palestinian officials have said Trump\u2019s declaration on Jerusalem meant he could not serve as an honest broker in peace negotiations with Israel that Washington has been trying to revive.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated over the weekend his call for UNRWA to be dismantled.  Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Susan Thomas"

          "body": "(Changes headlines, adds details, updates share performance)  SAO PAULO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Brazilian food company BRF SA launched a new meats brand aimed at cost-conscious buyers, venturing into the discount market that represents about one-third of the country\u2019s processed food sales, a company executive said on Tuesday.  Some 14 products including sausages, hamburgers, and cold cuts will be sold and primarily distributed at cash-and-carry outlets, BRF vice president for Brazil, Alexandre Almeida, told reporters during a conference call. Sale are set to begin in February, the company said.  The launch of the discount brand follows the lifting of antitrust restrictions last July, allowing BRF to target a segment that grew during the country\u2019s recession.  Antitrust agency Cade lifted brand limits established in 2011 at the time it approved the merger of Sadia and Perdig\u00e3o, which created BRF SA.  \u201cKidelli will compete in a market which registered robust growth in the last few years,\u201d Almeida said referring to the new brand name. He declined to offer sales or margin forecasts related to the launch.  The new processed products will cost 15 percent less than the average of more traditional brands in the market, Almeida said, and be produced at five of the company\u2019s 29 plants in Brazil.  The new brand will have a sales force independent from BRF\u2019s leading Sadia and Perdig\u00e3o brands, the company said. In the last three years, BRF has invested 560 million reais ($172 million) in \u201cinnovation\u201d projects, part of which went to develop the new brand, Almeida said.  Shares rose 0.55 percent to 39.91 reais in early-afternoon trading, after the announcement. The stock has risen  about 9 percent this year, reflecting expectations of an improved outlook for the company as Brazil\u2019s economy recovers from a deep recession.  BRF sees \u201chealthy growth\u201d in the food market this year, an improvement from the prior three years, Almeida said.  The launch will help BRF, Brazil\u2019s largest chicken exporter, reduce idle capacity at its Brazilian plants and allow it to compete again with regional brands on a national scale after the end of the antitrust restrictions.

          "title": "Berlusconi says Italy can't leave euro; coalition ally disagrees",
          "body": "ROME (Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi said on Tuesday that Italy must not leave the euro but his main coalition partner immediately disagreed, underlining policy differences in the centre-right bloc which is expected to take most seats in an election in March.   Berlusconi said in a radio interview that leaving the single currency would hurt Italy\u2019s economy and added that his main ally, the eurosceptic Northern League, now shared his view.  But the League\u2019s economics spokesman Claudio Borghi shot back that if the centre-right won the March 4 election it would immediately prepare for Italy to exit the euro, which many Italians blame for years of economic underperformance.  The conservative alliance, which also includes the far-right Brothers of Italy party, is projected to win most seats at the election but to fall short of an absolute majority.  The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is the most popular single party, has steadily rowed back on its previously eurosceptic stance and its leader said on Tuesday that leaving the single currency was no longer a party policy.   In an interview with Radio Capital, Berlusconi - whose Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party is the lynchpin of the centre-right coalition - said he spoke on behalf of League leader, Matteo Salvini, who has given mixed signals on the euro.  \u201cSalvini is no longer of the idea that we should leave the euro,\u201d Berlusconi said. \u201cHe has understood that it would be technically impossible and unsustainable for our economy.\u201d  The League has softened its anti-euro rhetoric recently but 81-year-old Berlusconi, who has often in the past claimed to speak on behalf of others, may have been overstating the change of tone in an effort to reassure moderate voters.  Shortly afterwards Borghi gave a very different view of the League\u2019s position in a television interview.  \u201cOne second after the League is in government it will begin all possible preparations to arrive at our monetary sovereignty. It\u2019s a question of national security,\u201d he said.  Despite Borghi\u2019s words, an exit from the euro did not feature among a list of vague policy priorities agreed by the centre-right parties at a meeting on Sunday.   Berlusconi has called for Italy to operate with two currencies, keeping the euro for international trade and tourism while printing its old lira currency for domestic use.   The prospect that eurosceptic parties could try to pull Italy out of the single currency worries financial markets, although euro exit is not a prominent theme in the election campaign.   As the Northern League has scaled back its anti-euro rhetoric, 5-Star has also watered down a previous commitment to hold a referendum on the euro as it seeks to reassure voters and investors that it can be trusted with power.  \u201cI believe it is no longer the right moment for Italy to leave the euro,\u201d Di Maio said in an interview on Tuesday with state television company RAI. \u201cThe referendum is a last resort which I hope to avoid,\u201d he added.  Di Maio has previously said that 5-Star will only pursue a referendum on the euro if it is unable to win any concessions from its partners to soften euro zone fiscal rules.  The 31-year-old party leader confirmed on Tuesday that 5-Star would raise the budget deficit above the EU\u2019s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in order to increase public investment in infrastructure.  He also said he wanted to renegotiate current EU rules on banks\u2019 capital requirements which he said were choking off the flow of credit to Italian companies.  additional reporting by Philip Pullella and Massimiliano di Giorgio; Editing by Richard Balmforth and Crispian Balmer"

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - Actress Catherine Deneuve and 99 other French women on Tuesday denounced a backlash against men following the Harvey Weinstein scandal, saying the #Metoo campaign against sexual harassment amounted to \u201cpuritanism\u201d and was fueled by a \u201chatred of men.\u201d  In the aftermath of accusations against the U.S. movie producer, millions of women took to social media to share their stories of being sexually harassed or assaulted, using the #Metoo hastag worldwide or #SquealOnYourPig (#balancetonporc)in France.  \u201cThis urge to send men to the slaughterhouse, instead of helping women be more autonomous, helps the enemies of sexual freedom,\u201d the 100 women, including 74-year old Deneuve, one of France\u2019s most famous screen stars, said in a column published by Le Monde daily.       The man\u2019s right to \u201cpester\u201d a woman was an essential part of sexual freedom, they said, describing the campaign as \u201cpuritanism\u201d.   Marlene Schiappa, the French minister tasked with cracking down on violence against women, said in a comment to Reuters that the Weinstein scandal forced a rethink of attitudes toward sexual harassment in France, a country that cherishes its self-image as the land of seduction and romance.  Schiappa kicked off nationwide consultations on a law that is due to include steps to fight sexual harassment on the streets as well as extend the statute of limitation for rape of minors.  In late October, protesters in Paris disrupted the opening of a retrospective of Roman Polanski\u2019s work following new rape allegations against the French-Polish film director.  But for Deneuve and the other signatories of the letter, including writers and journalists, this went too far.  \u201cThis vigilante (online) justice has punished men in their jobs, forced some to resign, when all they did was touch a knee, try to steal a kiss, talk about \u2018intimate\u2019 matters in a work diner,\u201d they wrote.   \u201cWe defend a right to pester, which is vital to sexual freedom,\u201d they said.

          "body": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria\u2019s president on Tuesday blamed clashes between Muslim cattle herders and Christian farmers on the clamor for land in the face of a population rapidly approaching 200 million people.  At least 83 people have been killed in the communal violence since Dec. 31.    Muhammadu Buhari, who called for calm, has already ordered a heightened police presence in the central state of Benue, where most of the killings took place in the last few weeks, including the relocation of the country\u2019s police chief.   Muslim herdsmen, mainly of the Fulani ethnic group, and Christian farmers often clash over the use of land in parts of central Nigeria, known as the Middle Belt.   \u201cPresident Buhari holds the view, as do many experts, that these conflicts are more often than not, as a result of major demographic changes in Nigeria,\u201d said an emailed statement issued by the presidency.   \u201cWhile the land size has not changed and will not change, urban sprawl and development have simply reduced land area both for peasant farming and cattle grazing,\u201d said the statement, urging people to remain calm and cooperate with security agencies.   It said Nigeria\u2019s population was around 63 million when the west African country gained independence in 1960, compared with a population now \u201cestimated at close to 200 million\u201d.  The United Nations estimates that Africa\u2019s most populous country is set to become the country with the world\u2019s third largest population, behind India and China, by 2050.    The presidency said a conference would be set up in an attempt to identify short and long term solutions to the problem of clashes between the semi-nomadic farmers and the mostly settled farmers.   The Middle Belt region is a diverse region in which differing religious, ancestral and cultural differences have frequently kindled conflict in the last few decades.  Despite the most recent outbreaks of violence, Nigerians, split roughly equally between Christians and Muslims from around 250 different ethnic groups, mostly live peacefully together.

Cities could re-route traffic away from congested streets, or make sure that self-driving cars are not cruising around searching for passengers, exacerbating traffic jams, Strader and Madra wrote.  Ride services companies and advocates of self-driving vehicles have argued that the shift away from human-driven, personal vehicles would result in less congestion. Auto industry executives talk of a world with \u201czero congestion.\u201d  A study of New York City traffic released in December concluded that 59 percent more ride hailing cars and cabs were operating in the city center in 2017 than in 2013. One-third of those vehicles were empty, according to the report by consultant Bruce Schaller, a former New York City transportation official.  New York officials are weighing various proposals to counter the trend, including assessing fees on ride services companies.

          "body": "WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland\u2019s ruling conservatives announced a major government reshuffle on Tuesday, in an apparent effort to mend relations with the European Union and moderate voters at home.  Following are details of new appointments.  Incoming ministers:  Teresa Czerwinska, finance  A former deputy finance minister responsible for the budget and a loyalist to Morawiecki. Her main task will be to secure money for the government\u2019s broad welfare spending agenda, maintaining efforts to improve tax collection, and to negotiate Poland\u2019s chunk of the EU\u2019s next seven-year budget.  Jacek Czaputowicz, foreign affairs  A political scientist with little hands-on diplomatic experience, who headed the ministry\u2019s legal department, Czaputowicz will oversee Poland\u2019s efforts to maintain close ties with allies in Washington.   Joachim Brudzinski, interior  A confidante of PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski who goes with him on fishing trips and is responsible for maintaining party loyalty among local officials. He will oversee migration policy, a major source of disagreement between PiS and Brussels.  Mariusz Blaszczak, defense  Previously interior minister, Blaszczak was a leading voice within the PiS government opposing EU migration quotas and arguing that Poland\u2019s security would be at risk if it let Muslim migrants in.  Poland\u2019s NATO allies are likely to watch closely his efforts to modernize the army, which had faced delays under the outgoing defense chief, Antoni Macierewicz.  Blaszczak will have to complete talks on a multi-billion-dollar contract with the U.S. firm Raytheon on the purchase of eight missile defense systems as well as a deal to buy submarines equipped with long-range missiles that the defense ministry said recently would be announced in January.   Henryk Kowalczyk, environment  A long-time PiS lawmaker, Kowalczyk will oversee Poland\u2019s disputed coal policy. The country\u2019s reliance on coal has put it on collision course with EU policies on reducing carbon emissions.  Jerzy Kwiecinski, investment   An engineer by training, Kwiecinski is a former deputy economic development minister.  Jadwiga Emilewicz, entrepreneurship   Will oversee technology policy.  Lukasz Szumowski, health  A cardiologist with limited political experience.  Outgoing ministers:  Antoni Macierewicz, defense  The PiS\u2019 investigator into the 2010 plane crash over Russia that killed President Lech Kaczynski, a founder of the party, army top brass and dozens of other officials, Macierewicz once said it was caused by a thermobaric bomb.   He has repeatedly asserted that the plane disintegrated in mid-air and accused Russian air traffic controllers of willingly misdirecting it, although an official investigation by Poland\u2019s centrist government at the time blamed the crash on pilot error due to thick fog.  A vocal anti-Russian hawk, Macierewicz had promised to double defense spending and add 100,000 personnel. But critics said his plans lacked financial details and followed \u201coutdated\u201d military thinking.  Witold Waszczykowski, foreign affairs  Seen by many observers as having had little impact on Polish foreign policy, Waszczykowski is best known for his many gaffes. Last year he mistakenly told reporters at the United Nations that he had met with representatives of the made-up nation of San Escobar.  He also told a German newspaper that the previous centrist government wanted a world full of \u201cbike riding vegetarians who only use renewable energy and fight all forms of religion\u201d.  Konstanty Radziwill, health  Widely criticized by the opposition in Poland over his handling of a protest by young doctors over work conditions, as well as a decision to eliminate maternity ward standards and comments disparaging concerns over air pollution.  Jan Szyszko, environment  An avid hunter, Szyszko had angered many in Poland for easing limits on hunting and felling of trees on private property. He approved tripling of the quota of wood that can be harvested in an ancient forest, a UNESCO World Heritage site, triggering EU court action.

Rowley was the public face of the police\u2019s counter-terrorism operations as attacks in Britain soared to their highest ever level last year, and he spearheaded the response to deadly incidents such as the London Bridge attack and the Manchester concert bombing.

Rowley joined the police in 1987. Before becoming Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism chief, he had responsibilities for tackling organised crime and sexual violence, and changed the force\u2019s approach to public order following riots in 2011.

On the first state visit of his eight-month-old presidency, Macron is hoping greater openness from China, coupled with lobbying from the 50-strong business delegation traveling with him, will help narrow the 30-billion-euro ($36 bln) trade deficit Paris runs with Beijing.  But despite bringing with him a delegation of French business, finance and industry - including senior executives from Airbus, BNP Paribas, AccorHotels, EDF and LVMH - there were no immediate announcements on the second leg of his three-day trip of major deals. Instead, smaller contracts or commitments to go on talking were signed.  BNP Paribas was set to announce plans for a joint-venture on consumer credit, a French official in Beijing said, adding that French nuclear group Areva had \u201cnever been so close\u201d to signing a contract to build a nuclear waste reprocessing plant in China.  \u201cWe have an access to markets which is unbalanced, unsatisfying,\u201d Macron told members of the French and Chinese business community at a start-up incubator in Beijing.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with this responsibly, the first, natural, reaction will be to close up on both sides.\u201d  In his short time in office, 40-year-old Macron has managed to push through reforms to France\u2019s labor market and seen a steady rise in business and consumer confidence. Growth forecasts for 2018 have been upgraded.  Macron has emerged as arguably the strongest voice in Europe, in the absence of either German and British leadership, with Chancellor Angela Merkel bogged down in coalition negotiations and Prime Minister Theresa May swamped by Brexit.  Soon after arriving in China, the French president declared that \u201cEurope is back\u201d, announcing he intended to visit China every year of his five-year presidency.  But while the rhetoric has been strong, and TV commentary suggests Macron and his glamorous 64-year-old wife Brigitte have been a big hit with the Chinese, the underlying success of state visits is often measured in the size of business contracts.  Planemaker Airbus was in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China, officials familiar with the talks said last week.  But after an official contract signing ceremony on Tuesday, it appeared that an Airbus deal had not been clinched. That would be a significant setback for Macron and Europe, although it is possible details will be finalised in the weeks ahead.  U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to China last year  coincided with an announcement by Boeing Co that it had sold 300 aircraft to China.  Without a big dollar figure attached to the visit, Macron appeared to have fallen short, although French officials said China had asked them not to put a figure on any commercial and industrial deals they did strike.  Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of online retailer Alibaba, gave Macron\u2019s pitch for more openness his backing on Tuesday, but added both sides had a part to play.  \u201cI think he\u2019s right, China should open more, China is opening more,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of a business forum in Beijing.  \u201cFrance should open more, China should open more,\u201d he added.  Foreign businesses in China though have grown more pessimistic about Beijing\u2019s market restrictions even though government officials have repeatedly pledged to increase access. These businesses have also chafed at government policies they see as intended to assimilate and supplant foreign technology.  \u201cWe welcome France to expand investment in China and exports of high-grade French products, and we hope the French side will further loosen exports of high-tech products to China,\u201d China\u2019s Premier Li Keqiang told Macron, according to a Chinese government statement.  Macron, who met President Xi Jinping on Monday, said the two countries would fall into a lose-lose situation if continued restrictions on foreign firms in China prompted France and Europe to put a brake on Chinese investment in Europe.  \u201cLet\u2019s open up both instead,\u201d said Macron, whose government has at the same time called for greater scrutiny of Chinese investment in Europe, particularly in sensitive sectors, concerned about protecting French interests and security.  The two presidents met again on Tuesday at Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People, and oversaw the signing of bilateral agreements, including the framework deals for Airbus and Areva in China.  Chinese online retail giant JD.com agreed to sell 2 billion euros worth of French products - such as Remy Martin cognac or Evian water - on its website over the next two years. JD.com also signed a deal to buy 100 million euros of machinery from French engineering firm Fives.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. power grid regulator on Monday rejected a directive by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to prop up aging coal and nuclear power plants, in a setback for the Trump administration that disappointed coal miners but pleased drillers, environmentalists and renewable energy advocates.   Perry had directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in September to consider a plan subsidizing those plants for what he said were their contributions in making the power grid more reliable and resilient.  FERC said in its ruling that such subsidies may not be fair. \u201cThe record ... does not demonstrate that such an outcome would be just and reasonable,\u201d the agency said in the filing. FERC said it had embarked on a new process to determine whether the grid can be strengthened.  The move was a blow to Perry who wanted FERC to reward certain nuclear and coal-fired power plants that store 90 days of fuel on site by paying for their operating costs through power price adjustments.   President Donald Trump promised to aid the coal and nuclear industries, which have suffered shutdowns resulting from a glut of cheap natural gas.  FERC\u2019s new plan involves asking grid operators to submit within 60 days their concerns about the resiliency of the power system. The commission will then decide whether additional action is warranted, FERC said.  Perry\u2019s directive came under harsh criticism by an unusual combination of natural gas, drilling, and wind and solar power interests who said it could hurt their industries and stifle innovation to improve power plants and the grid.  The critics said the vast majority of power outages have been caused by problems with power lines, not at utilities themselves.   Consumer interests also slammed Perry\u2019s plan, saying it would have spiked power bills for homeowners and businesses.    Some coal companies, including Peabody Energy Corp and privately held Murray Energy Corp, have lobbied the Trump administration to make policy changes as low natural gas prices and regulations cut into their profits.  Hal Quinn, president of the National Mining Association, said FERC\u2019s decision represented a \u201cdisappointing lack of action,\u201d especially as it came during a week of severe cold weather across the country. \u201cThat coal-powered electricity came from many plants that will no longer be available if retirements continue at the pace expected,\u201d Quinn said.  Perry said in a statement after FERC\u2019s ruling that his directive had started a national conversation about the resiliency of the grid, or its ability to withstand severe weather and other conditions.   Renewable energy advocates cheered FERC\u2019s decision to seek feedback from grid operators.   \u201cWe believe FERC has laid out a sensible approach to gathering the vital information needed to support any changes to electricity markets, and we are confident that, in the end, the record still will not support market intervention,\u201d Gregory Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said in a statement.  The Energy Department said it is now exploring ways to monitor the long-term resiliency of the grid, potentially with a model led by its electricity office and its national labs.

The company said it expected to achieve benefits from changing the way it works with clients, such as by using artificial intelligence and improving its use of databases.  It also sees benefits from closer cooperation with banks.  PZU bought a stake in medium-sized lender Alior Bank in 2015, and in Poland\u2019s second largest bank Pekao SA last year.  It hopes business with banks will contribute more than 900 million zloty ($257 million) to group annual profit in 2020.  \u201cWe will gather one billion zloty of insurance premiums thanks to cooperation with banks and (will deliver) a million new clients for banks,\u201d PZU CFO Tomasz Kulik was quoted as saying in a statement.  PZU also said it planned to pay out at least 50 percent of its net profit in dividends, and this proportion could rise to 80 percent if it did not conduct a major takeover. Analysts do not expect PZU to make a big acquisition.  Last year PZU shares rose 27 percent, slightly outperforming the main Warsaw stock index, while the banking sector rose by more than 35 percent.  $1 = 3.5080 zlotys\nReporting by Marcin Goclowski; Editing by Mark Potter"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two U.S. companies shelved proposals to launch bitcoin exchange-traded funds, citing ongoing concerns by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), filings showed on Monday.  Staff at the regulatory agency \u201cexpressed concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation\u201d of futures contracts based on the digital asset, according to one of the filings.  The move adds a new hurdle to the bid by Wall Street firms to capitalize on investor interest in cryptocurrencies, and it opens a rare public divergence between two financial regulatory agencies over how to regulate them.  Trusts controlled by Rafferty Asset Management LLC and Exchange Traded Concepts LLC each canceled plans to launch three bitcoin funds that could be traded by retail investors as easily as stocks. Neither firm could be reached for comment.  Fund managers thought the proposals had a chance at winning approval given the launch last month of futures contracts based on bitcoin on both the CME and the CBOE exchanges.  Regulators have been scrambling to figure out how to deal with this relatively new asset, and no single one has control.  The SEC has dominion over funds, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) governs futures contracts. The CFTC  has been under pressure to address concerns it did not fully assess the potential risks that bitcoin poses to the financial system.  Bitcoin is a virtual asset that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. Trading has been expensive, difficult and fraught with wild price swings.  The SEC\u2019s decisions also face close scrutiny given its power to clear the way for products that could be among the more volatile traded in U.S. equity markets.   The SEC and the CFTC could not immediately be reached for comment.  One of the ETFs being proposed would be designed to rise or fall in price twice as fast as the price of bitcoin on a given day. Over the last two years alone, bitcoin has gained or lost more than 10 percent on a single day 26 different times, according to data from the Bitstamp exchange.  Bitcoin\u2019s price was little changed at about $15,000 Monday evening on the Bitstamp exchange.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - A government reshuffle by British Prime Minister Theresa May was dismissed even by some of her allies on Tuesday as a failure that one said left her attempt to reassert her authority in \u201csmoke and wreckage\u201d.  One former minister, George Osborne, sacked by May when she came to power in July 2016, led the criticism, calling the moves a \u201cfarce\u201d.  But other more loyal members of her governing Conservatives also questioned the prime minister\u2019s ability to put the party back on track for election success after a year of scandals, gaffes and divisions over Brexit.  A cabinet reshuffle is meant to offer a chance for a leader to assert authority on a team. May had hoped the limited changes would not only re-energize her domestic agenda but also strengthen her hand in talks to leave the European Union.  Instead, it did little more than demonstrate May\u2019s weakness, with the only high-profile moves derailed when one minister quit rather than take a new job and another talked May out of changing his role.  May said her reshuffle helped the government look \u201cmore like the country it serves\u201d.  \u201cIt allows a new generation of gifted ministers to step up and make life better for people across the whole UK,\u201d she said  in a statement.  But for Osborne, it was simply a \u201cfarce\u201d.  \u201cYou have to hand it to this prime minister: she\u2019s given us the hat-trick of the worst reshuffle, the worst party conference speech and the worst manifesto in modern history,\u201d the former finance minister wrote in his newspaper, London\u2019s Evening Standard.  \u201cIf they were not facing one of the worst oppositions we\u2019ve ever had, the Tories would be finished.\u201d  But while his criticism was to be expected, even loyal lawmakers and commentators asked why the prime minister had launched a reshuffle from a weakened position, unable to force her will.  \u201cShe should not have been in the position of having to plead with a minister whose talents she needs, faced with a choice of giving in or sacking him,\u201d the Conservativehome website, which airs the views of the party, wrote in an editorial.  But, it added, in the \u201csmoke and wreckage this morning, there are a few points of hope and light\u201d.  On Tuesday, May moved to promote younger, black and women lawmakers to junior roles in government, hoping to rid the party of its reputation of being \u201cpale, stale and male\u201d.  But by playing very much to her own party rather than the country, some critics said May risks losing the chance to revitalize what her aides call her \u201creform agenda\u201d, already hampered by Brexit, a scandal over sexual harassment and struggling public services.  Monday\u2019s reshuffle was blown off course when Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt convinced May at a lengthy meeting not to move him to a different job. Newspapers said he refused to accept a new post, although a source close to May denied that, and said Hunt simply persuaded her.  Then education minister Justine Greening refused to take a job at the pensions department and quit instead.  Losing the only gay minister in the cabinet threatens what May hoped to be the narrative of her reshuffle: that she was ushering in a new, more diverse team to counter accusations that the Conservative Party is out of touch.  The resignation of the newly appointed board member of a new universities watchdog over sexist tweets also did little to help distance May from scandals over sexual harassment last year that brought down two ministers.  But aides had long said Monday\u2019s moves were less important that those on Tuesday, when May promoted lawmakers to junior positions in preparation of a wider reshuffle after Brexit.  \u201cToday I expect the rest of the picture to show that it\u2019s more about preparing the ground for a post-Brexit reshuffle at a senior level,\u201d Crispin Blunt, a Conservative lawmaker, told Reuters.  And few predicted the furor to lead to her downfall.  \u201cOnce everyone is in place, there won\u2019t be any trouble,\u201d a senior Conservative member said on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019ll be more of the same, she will take one step at a time ... and suddenly, we\u2019ll be in 2019.\u201d  additional reporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Peter Graff and Angus MacSwan"

But for Osborne, it was simply a \u201cfarce\u201d.  \u201cYou have to hand it to this prime minister: she\u2019s given us the hat-trick of the worst reshuffle, the worst party conference speech and the worst manifesto in modern history,\u201d the former finance minister wrote in his newspaper, London\u2019s Evening Standard.  \u201cIf they were not facing one of the worst oppositions we\u2019ve ever had, the Tories would be finished.\u201d  But while his criticism was to be expected, even loyal lawmakers and commentators asked why the prime minister had launched a reshuffle from a weakened position, unable to force her will.  \u201cShe should not have been in the position of having to plead with a minister whose talents she needs, faced with a choice of giving in or sacking him,\u201d the Conservativehome website, which airs the views of the party, wrote in an editorial.  But, it added, in the \u201csmoke and wreckage this morning, there are a few points of hope and light\u201d.  On Tuesday, May moved to promote younger, black and women lawmakers to junior roles in government, hoping to rid the party of its reputation of being \u201cpale, stale and male\u201d.  But by playing very much to her own party rather than the country, some critics said May risks losing the chance to revitalize what her aides call her \u201creform agenda\u201d, already hampered by Brexit, a scandal over sexual harassment and struggling public services.  Monday\u2019s reshuffle was blown off course when Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt convinced May at a lengthy meeting not to move him to a different job. Newspapers said he refused to accept a new post, although a source close to May denied that, and said Hunt simply persuaded her.  Then education minister Justine Greening refused to take a job at the pensions department and quit instead.  Losing the only gay minister in the cabinet threatens what May hoped to be the narrative of her reshuffle: that she was ushering in a new, more diverse team to counter accusations that the Conservative Party is out of touch.  The resignation of the newly appointed board member of a new universities watchdog over sexist tweets also did little to help distance May from scandals over sexual harassment last year that brought down two ministers.  But aides had long said Monday\u2019s moves were less important that those on Tuesday, when May promoted lawmakers to junior positions in preparation of a wider reshuffle after Brexit.  \u201cToday I expect the rest of the picture to show that it\u2019s more about preparing the ground for a post-Brexit reshuffle at a senior level,\u201d Crispin Blunt, a Conservative lawmaker, told Reuters.  And few predicted the furor to lead to her downfall.  \u201cOnce everyone is in place, there won\u2019t be any trouble,\u201d a senior Conservative member said on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019ll be more of the same, she will take one step at a time ... and suddenly, we\u2019ll be in 2019.\u201d  additional reporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Peter Graff and Angus MacSwan"

          "body": "* FTSE 100 up 0.45 pct  * Morrisons lead retailers after Christmas update  * Persimmon update gets lukewarm reception  * Utilities weigh (Updates prices)  By Kit Rees  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The UK\u2019s top share index climbed to a new record closing level on Tuesday as Morrisons led a buoyant retail sector on the back of a well-received Christmas trading update.  Britain\u2019s blue chip FTSE 100 index ended up 0.45 percent at 7,731 points.  Shares in Morrisons were among the best performers on the FTSE, up 2.4 percent after the supermarket chain beat sales expectations in the all-important Christmas trading period.  That lifted other British food retailers, as shares in peers Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury rose 2.4 percent and 3.1 percent respectively.  \u201cThe Morrisons update is clearly better than expected,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.  \u201cMarks has got the double benefit of both food and clothing and houseware. Next gave a good update from the clothing and the houseware section, Morrisons is giving a good update for the grocery, so perhaps Marks can benefit twofold there,\u201d van Dulken added, referring to Next\u2019s upbeat Christmas update last week.  Sainsbury, Tesco and Marks & Spencer are all due to give updates on Christmas trading this week.  Concerns over how UK retailers have fared over the holiday season were raised after Debenhams and Mothercare saw sharp share price drops following their updates.  Industry figures showed that shoppers feeling the pinch from inflation scaled back on almost everything except for food in the last three months of 2017.  That led to the biggest fall in non-grocery spending since 2009.  \u201cFood sales have managed to shrug off the consumer slowdown, after all, eating three meals a day is more important than having the very latest iPhone,\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note.  Utilities were the only sector to suffer, following a pan-European trend with United Utilities Group, Severn Trent and Centrica down 3.6 percent, 3.2 percent and 2.5 percent respectively.  Elsewhere, shares in Persimmon declined 1.2 percent after a trading update, with the housebuilder saying that it was hoping to achieve a modest increase in sales this year.  Shares in Micro Focus, which plunged nearly 17 percent in the previous session after saying its revenue would fall this year after disappointing sales from the software assets it bought from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, recovered slightly and were up 2.6 percent.  Analysts at Barclays said that the fall in Micro Focus was so harsh it was hard to justify.  \u201cWe would look through the volatility in trading and use this as an opportunity,\u201d they said in a note.

          "body": "Jan 9 (Reuters) - Netherlands-listed telecom group Altice\u2019s leveraged loans rebounded strongly in Europe\u2019s secondary loan market on Tuesday, on the back of the firm\u2019s announced reorganisation on Monday that will see the US business spun off to existing shareholders.  Altice\u2019s \u20ac300m 2026 term loan B was quoted at 99.75% of face value on January 9, while French subsidiary SFR\u2019s \u20ac1.145bn B11 and \u20ac1bn B12 term loans were both quoted at 98.875, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.  All three term loans recovered at least 150bp within the space of a day, up from 98.1%, 97.1% and 97.2% of face value respectively on Monday, TRLPC data shows.  The improvement in loan pricing follows a rebound in Altice\u2019s shares after the announcement, which rose 10% on January 9 to \u20ac10.37 in afternoon trading.  The loans had traded above par until Altice issued a profit warning in early November 2017 following the loss of 75,000 customers in France in its third quarter results.  Following the announcement the loans plummeted and hit a low point on December 12, when Altice\u2019s \u20ac300m facility dropped to an average bid of 96.45, over 350bp lower than on November 2, the day Altice issued the profit warning.  CEO Michel Combes resigned from the firm shortly after the third quarter results announcement, prompting Drahi to re-instate himself to everyday handling of the business as president.  Drahi then mooted the possibility of a restructuring of the business, which had pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy in recent years that brought its debt pile to \u20ac51bn \u2014 \u2014 more than five times its annual core operating profit.  The current reshaping includes the sale of Altice NV\u2019s 67.2% holding in Altice USA business to existing shareholders. The listed US business, no longer owned by Altice NV, will then be shielded from concerns about the European operations.  A US$2bn share repurchase has also been agreed by Altice USA\u2019s board of directors.  Altice said it would prioritise efforts to turn around its European operations.  Altice USA will pay a parting dividend of US$1.5bn to the European arm, to be named Altice Europe. Divestments of non-core assets, some of which are already under way, should also help to pay down debt, Altice said.  The two companies will be led by separate management teams with Franco-Israeli billionaire Drahi retaining control of both and garnering a large share of the dividend as well as the US$2bn share buyback planned by Altice USA.  Altice\u2019s European business is set to be split between Altice France, Altice International and a newly created subsidiary Altice Pay TV.  The reorganisation is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. (Editing by Claire Ruckin)"

          "body": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Two-year-old Emir al-Bash\u2019s blood still showed on his mother\u2019s hand as she sat in a medical center in Syria\u2019s besieged eastern Ghouta where his body was taken after he died from a shellblast.  His family had left their home in the village of Kafr Batna on Monday for a market in a nearby village, seeking food for their malnourished children, but a mortar shell landed close to them, instantly killing the boy.   \u201cMy child died hungry. We wanted to feed him. He was crying from hunger when we left the house,\u201d said the mother, Heba Amouri. Emir is the second child she has lost since the war began six years ago.  Eastern Ghouta is the last big stronghold of rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad near the capital Damascus and has been besieged for years.   The United Nations estimates it is home to 400,000 civilians and says food and medical supplies have run low. The army and its allies - Russia and Iran-backed militias - bombard it daily. Rebels there shell government-held Damascus.   After Emir\u2019s death, Amouri tried to quiet her surviving baby, a hungry two-month-old girl, by placing her finger in her mouth at the medical center. Malnutrition means she is unable to breastfeed, she said.    On Saturday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was alarmed by the ongoing violence in eastern Ghouta and the growing number of civilian casualties and displacement since the start of the year.   \u201cNow I lost my second child. My baby daughter is the only surviving child,\u201d Mahmoud al-Bash, 27, Emir\u2019s father said. A year ago, the family lost another son to the bombardment.   The United Nations children\u2019s agency UNICEF said in November that 11.9 percent of children under five in eastern Ghouta suffered acute malnourishment.   Mothers of infants had reduced breastfeeding or stopped it altogether because of their own poor nutrition, it said.  On Monday evening, Emir\u2019s father carried Emir\u2019s tiny body wrapped in bright white cloth, marked with a big blood stain, to the village\u2019s cemetery.   \u201cMay God protect the children, and everyone, and take the life of Bashar (al-Assad),\u201d he said, fixing his eyes on his child as he bid him a last farewell.

          "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Billionaire Ira Rennert has filed a $214 million malpractice lawsuit against his former law firm, after a jury found him liable for looting his magnesium company to build a huge mansion in New York\u2019s Hamptons.  Renco Group Inc, Rennert\u2019s holding company, said neither it nor the mining mogul would have been liable had Kaye Scholer and partner Peter Haveles objected to faulty jury instructions that Rennert has said led to an \u201cirrational\u201d February 2015 verdict.  The lawsuit, filed late Monday in the state supreme court in Manhattan, may be the last chance for Rennert, 83, to avoid a big payout, after the U.S. Supreme Court in October rejected his appeal of the verdict and resulting $213.2 million judgment.  Both had been upheld by the federal appeals court in Manhattan last March.  Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, the successor firm to Kaye Scholer, did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. Haveles, now a partner at Pepper Hamilton, referred a reporter to his former firm.  Rennert is worth $3.8 billion according to Forbes magazine, and has denied the looting allegations. His current lawyer, Steven Kaufman, was unavailable for comment on the lawsuit, which also seeks interest.  The case arose from the 2001 bankruptcy of Magnesium Corp of America.  Lee Buchwald, MagCorp\u2019s bankruptcy trustee, accused Rennert of diverting money from the now-defunct company to help build his 21-bedroom, 43,000-square-foot mansion known as Fair Field on 65 oceanfront acres in Sagaponack, on Long Island.  The property was valued last March at $248.5 million, real estate records show.  Jurors in Manhattan federal court found Rennert and Renco liable for $118 million to the MagCorp estate. The trial judge, Alison Nathan, later added interest.  Rennert has long said the verdict made no sense because jurors thought MagCorp was solvent at the time of the alleged transfers.  In Monday\u2019s complaint, Renco said its former lawyers wrongly failed to object both to jury instructions that led to the \u201cinexplicably inconsistent\u201d verdict, and to the jury\u2019s dismissal after the verdict was read.  Had the lawyers spoken up, the jury would have announced a verdict \u201cconsistent with the 27 interrogatories it answered finding 27 separate times that the (Renco) subsidiaries were not insolvent or inadequately capitalized,\u201d Renco said.  The case is Renco Group Inc v Kaye Scholer LLP et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 150184/2018. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The inability of law enforcement authorities to access data from  electronic devices due to powerful encryption is an \u201curgent public safety issue,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Tuesday as he sought to renew a contentious debate over privacy and security.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation was unable to access data from nearly 7,800 devices in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 with technical tools despite possessing proper legal authority to pry them open, a growing figure that impacts every area of the agency\u2019s work, Wray said during a speech at a cyber security conference in New York.  The FBI has been unable to access data in more than half of the devices that it tried to unlock due to encryption, Wray added.  \u201cThis is an urgent public safety issue,\u201d Wray added, while saying that a solution is \u201cnot so clear cut.\u201d  Technology companies and many digital security experts have said that the FBI\u2019s attempts to require that devices allow investigators a way to access a criminal suspect\u2019s cellphone would harm internet security and empower malicious hackers. U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, have expressed little interest in pursuing legislation to require companies to create products whose contents are accessible to authorities who obtain a warrant.  Wray\u2019s comments at the International Conference on Cyber Security were his most extensive yet as FBI director about the so-called Going Dark problem, which his agency and local law enforcement authorities for years have said bedevils countless investigations. Wray took over as FBI chief in August.  The FBI supports strong encryption and information security broadly, Wray said, but described the current status quo as untenable.  \u201cWe face an enormous and increasing number of cases that rely heavily, if not exclusively, on electronic evidence,\u201d Wray told an audience of FBI agents, international law enforcement representatives and private sector cyber professionals. A solution requires \u201csignificant innovation,\u201d Wray said, \u201cbut I just do not buy the claim that it is impossible.\u201d  Wray\u2019s remarks echoed those of his predecessor, James Comey, who before being fired by President Donald Trump in May frequently spoke about the dangers of unbreakable encryption.   Tech companies and many cyber security experts have said that any measure ensuring that law enforcement authorities are able to access data from encrypted products would weaken cyber security for everyone.   U.S. officials have said that default encryption settings on cellphones and other devices hinder their ability to collect evidence needed to pursue criminals.  The matter came to a head in 2016 when the Justice Department tried unsuccessfully to force Apple Inc to break into an iPhone used by a gunman during a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.   The Trump administration at times has taken a tougher stance on the issue than former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in October chastised technology companies for building strongly encrypted products, suggesting Silicon Valley is more willing to comply with foreign government demands for data than those made by their home country.

Stocks continued their winning streak as investors extended their bets on an improving economy and expectations of corporate profits that may get a boost from the tax cuts.  At 11:27 p.m. ET (1627 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 109.74 points, or 0.43 percent, at 25,392.74 and the S&P 500 was up 9.65 points, or 0.35 percent, at 2,757.36.  The Nasdaq Composite was up 16.07 points, or 0.22 percent, at 7,173.45.  \u201cI can see more of a sideways trending till the big macro releases and earnings season, which is just around,\u201d said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for The Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank.  Healthcare and financial stocks were the biggest gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors.  A 2.4 percent rise in Johnson & Johnson and a 5 percent jump in Boston Scientific helped the S&P health sector gain 0.9 percent.  Citigroup rose 1 percent and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs rose about 0.6 percent, tracking a rise in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which hit a 10-month high after the Bank of Japan said it would trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds.  Investors are waiting for the start of the quarterly earnings season for more readings on the impact of recent tax cuts and profit forecasts.  Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an 8 percent increase a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  \u201cAcross the board, we\u2019re positive about fourth quarter and the next few quarters. But it could be a little bit noisy after we got the tax reform law passed and companies make some adjustments close to year-end,\u201d Dreiling said.  A handful of retailers including Target, Kohl\u2019s Corp and Lululemon Athletica have already reported solid rise in same-store sales for the holiday period and raised their profit forecasts for the fourth quarter.  Advanced Micro Devices slipped 3.5 percent after Microsoft suspended patches to guard against security threats for computers running AMD chipsets after complaints that the software updates froze their machines.  GoPro fell 6 percent, extending losses from Monday after the action camera-maker flagged a weak holiday quarter that triggered sale talks.

          "title": "Greek Communist anti-austerity protesters storm labor ministry",
          "body": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek demonstrators stormed the country\u2019s labor ministry and confronted its chief on Tuesday in protest at moves to  restrict the right to strike, a condition set by international creditors in exchange for bailout funds.  Athens is set to introduce legislation which could limit the frequency of strikes in the country, infuriating labor unions which regard industrial action as sacrosanct.      Using crowbars, about 500 demonstrators with Greek Communist-affiliated group PAME prised open metal shutters of the labor ministry in central Athens, racing up to the eighth floor of the building where about 50 of them came face to face with Labor Minister Effie Achtsioglou.  The 32-year old minister is a staunch leftist in the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.  Visibly disturbed, Achtsioglou was silent as demonstrators shouted \u201cshame on you\u201d over legislation due to go to parliament this week.   \u201cTake it back,\u201d they shouted. \u201cI will not take it back,\u201d she responded.  Her office was undamaged, but a Reuters witness saw two to three desks in the corridor leading to her office damaged or overturned.  Earlier, about 500 protesters had rallied outside the labor ministry, putting up a banner reading \u201cMinistry of EU and IMF!\u201d and chanting \u201cWe won\u2019t yield to plutocracy!\u201d  The European Union and International Monetary Fund have bailed Greece out from becoming bankrupt due to oppressive debt, but demanded severe austerity in exchange. Part of that has been changes to the labor law.    More protesters arrived as a group unfurled a huge banner that read \u201cHands off strikes, it\u2019s a labor right!\u201d, hanging it from the roof of the ministry on a busy street in central Athens.       Greece\u2019s leftist-led government was due to submit a bill with bailout-mandated reforms to parliament on Tuesday. The government has agreed to increase the quorum for unions to vote on a strike.   Lawmakers are expected to vote on the reforms before a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Jan 22, which will assess the country\u2019s bailout progress as part of a review by its lenders.

          "body": "DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil\u2019s price rally this year to its highest since May 2015 may seem a source of glee for OPEC, but some in the producer group fear the gains could prompt shale companies to crank open their spigots and flood the market.  Benchmark Brent crude rose further above $68 a barrel on Tuesday, supported by oil output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia that are due to run until the end of 2018.  The surge comes as a welcome boost for the revenues of oil-producing nations, many still reeling from a price collapse that started in mid-2014 when crude began to fall steeply from above $100 per barrel due to oversupply.   Some in OPEC are worried a prolonged rally could stimulate more U.S. shale oil output, however, creating more oversupply that could weigh on prices and market share.  \u201cWe all are excited about the rally and want to see if it will be sustainable during the year, as it will certainly whet the appetite of shale producers,\u201d an official from an OPEC country said.  The oil minister of Iran, OPEC\u2019s third-largest producer, said on Tuesday that the organization\u2019s members were not keen on increased prices as such gains would encourage more shale production.  OPEC has no formal target for oil prices. However, Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s top producer, wants to see crude above $60 to boost the valuation of its national oil company Aramco before an initial public offering of shares this year and to reduce the gap in its state budget, Saudi sources have said.  OPEC sources say Saudi Arabia has become a strong advocate of higher prices, a shift from a more moderate stance in the past, and Saudi officials have downplayed the threat of a boost in shale production.  Even so, U.S. production is expected soon to rise above 10 million barrels per day, close to Saudi levels, due largely to soaring output from shale drillers, government data shows. [EIA/M]    OPEC officials also think the 2018 rally has been mainly driven by unrest in Iran, rather than a tighter balance between supply and demand, giving rise to concern it may not last.  \u201cOil prices rose because of the political situation in Iran,\u201d an OPEC source said. \u201cThere is a worry now that this would be followed by a sharp decline in prices.\u201d  A third OPEC source said market fundamentals did not justify the price rally.   \u201cIt is only politics that is changing the mood. The push in prices will mean the peak is near and hence prices will give up some of the gains.\u201d  While OPEC sources say oil market fundamentals remain strong on the back of the supply cuts, others are worried that economic growth in consuming countries could slow and higher prices might encourage some producers to pump above their output target.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Many nations, including the United States, Canada and several European countries, as well as top United Nations and EU officials are among those demanding the release of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo from detention in Myanmar.   The reporters were arrested four weeks ago, on Dec. 12, after being invited to meet police officials on the outskirts of Yangon. They had worked on stories about a military crackdown in Rakhine state, from where about 665,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled since August and sought refuge in Bangladesh, according to the United Nations.  The two journalists were sent to Yangon\u2019s Insein prison  after a brief court appearance on Dec. 27, when they were allowed to meet their families and a lawyer for the first time since their arrest. Their second court appearance is due on Wednesday.  Myanmar\u2019s Ministry of Information has said the reporters \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,\u201d and released a photo of them in handcuffs at the time of the arrest.  It said the reporters and two policemen faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, though officials said they have not been charged.   Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.  \u201cAs they near their hearing date, it remains entirely clear that they are innocent of any wrongdoing,\u201d Adler said in a statement on Monday.   \u201cTheir arrest and continued incarceration represent an egregious attack on press freedom \u2014 preventing them, and deterring other journalists, from reporting independently in Myanmar.\u201d      Here are comments on their detention from governments, politicians, human rights groups, journalists and press freedom advocates around the world:    - Former U.S. President Bill Clinton called on Monday for the immediate release of the two journalists. \u201cA free press is critical to a free society - the detention of journalists anywhere is unacceptable,\u201d Clinton said in a Twitter post.  - The Committee to Protect Journalists called on Myanmar on Monday to cease all legal proceedings against the two Reuters journalists and release them from jail.  \u201cThe proceedings against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are a transparent attempt to intimidate the media and to prevent coverage of the unfolding tragedy of the Rohingya people in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state,\u201d said Steven Butler, CPJ\u2019s Asia program coordinator.   \u201cThe two reporters should not be in jail for trying to uncover the truth about this story of vital public interest.\u201d  - Samantha Power, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called the arrests \u201can outrage and a symptom of a world without credible U.S. leadership\u201d in a Twitter post.       - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the United States was \u201cdemanding their immediate release or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.\u201d  - Senator Ben Cardin, the leading Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee called the arrests of the two journalists \u201coutrageous\u201d.  \u201cIt just brings back the memory of the horrible practices with the repressive military rule,\u201d he said.  - Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Chris Coons, leaders of the U.S. Senate Human Rights Caucus, said they were \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the reporters\u2019 arrests and that press freedom was critical to ensuring accountability for violence against the Rohingya.  - The European Union has urged Myanmar to release the two Reuters reporters \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d A spokeswoman for the EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said, \u201cFreedom of the press and media is the foundation and a cornerstone of any democracy.\u201d   - Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kano said, \u201cFreedom of the press is extremely important, including in order to protect fundamental human rights. The Japanese government would like to watch (this matter) closely.\u201d Tokyo-based Human Rights Now has called on Japan to take a stronger stance.   - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said countries should do everything possible to secure the journalists\u2019 release and press freedom in Myanmar.  - Surakiart Sathirathai, the head of a new international advisory panel on the Rohingya crisis, said he had asked Suu Kyi\u2019s national security adviser for the case to be dealt with transparently and been assured that proper legal procedures would be followed.  - Yanghee Lee and David Kaye, the U.N. special rapporteurs on Myanmar and on freedom of expression respectively, said, \u201cJournalism is not a crime. These detentions are another way for the government to censor information about the military\u2019s role in Rakhine State and the humanitarian catastrophe taking place.\u201d   - Britain, Holland, Canada, Norway and Sweden have demanded the release of the Reuters reporters. Australia has expressed concern and Bangladesh has denounced the arrests.   - Vijay Nambiar, former special adviser on Myanmar to the U.N. Secretary-General, said in a statement to Reuters that the detentions had caused \u201cwidespread disappointment within and outside the country that is likely to further damage the international reputation and image of Myanmar.\u201d  - President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani called on Myanmar to protect media freedoms and release the reporters.  - Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d to hear of the detention of the two Reuters journalists.   - A group of 50 Pulitzer Prize winners called the arrests \u201can outrageous attack on media freedom\u201d and demanded the immediate release of the two journalists. \u201cWa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are brave, principled and professional journalists who were working in the public interest and were jailed simply for doing their jobs,\u201d they said in a statement.  - The New York Times said in an editorial that releasing the two journalists immediately \u201cwould help restore at least some lost faith\u201d in Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government.  - Washington-based Freedom House called in a statement for the immediate release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, saying their \u201creal offense in the eyes of the government was their reporting on military crackdowns in Rakhine State\u201d.  - Human Rights Watch said the detentions appeared to be \u201caimed at stopping independent reporting of the ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya.\u201d   - Reporters Without Borders said there was no justification for the arrests and the charges being considered against the journalists were \u201ccompletely spurious\u201d.  - Advocacy group Fortify Rights demanded Myanmar  immediately and unconditionally release the Reuters journalists.   - Myanmar\u2019s Irrawaddy online news site called on Dec. 14 for the journalists\u2019 release in an editorial headlined \u201cThe Crackdown on the Media Must Stop.\u201d It said \u201cit is an outrage to see the Ministry of Information release a police record photo of reporters handcuffed \u2013 as police normally do to criminals \u2013 on its website soon after the detention. It is chilling to see that MOI has suddenly brought us back to the olden days of a repressive regime.\u201d  - The Southeast Asian Press Alliance said the journalists were \u201conly doing their jobs in trying to fill the void of information on the Rohingya conflict.\u201d   - The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists, local reporters who have demonstrated against prosecutions of journalists, decried the \u201cunfair arrests that affect media freedom\u201d.   - The Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Myanmar said it was \u201cappalled\u201d by the arrests and \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about press freedom in Myanmar.   - The Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club in Thailand, Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Association of the Philippines, Jakarta Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club and Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Hong Kong have issued statements supporting the journalists.

          "title": "Sterling snaps three-day climb, but Brexit hopes support",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling weakened on Tuesday, snapping a three-day rising streak  as investors took profits, although expectations that Brexit talks will have a positive outcome continued to underpin the British currency.  External factors have also proved supportive for the pound, recently with the U.S. dollar struggling to gain much traction against its rivals in the opening days of the year.  \u201cWe expect to see progress towards securing a transitional deal (on leaving the European Union) in the coming months and that should be constructive for sterling,\u201d said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at MUFJ in London. He expects the pound to rise to 1.40 against the dollar over the next six months.  On Tuesday, sterling weakened as much as 0.5 percent to $1.3504 but remained within striking distance of a four-month high of $1.3614 hit last week.  Against the euro, it has been a more mixed picture, with sterling oscillating around the 88 cents line over the last month.   Jordan Rochester, a London-based FX strategist at Nomura, said sterling\u2019s weakness on Tuesday had been more about dollar strength.  \u201cToday is not a UK-specific story. It\u2019s more of a dollar and yen outperformance day,\u201d he said, referring to the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to trim its purchases of long-dated government bonds in market operations.   Nomura expects the pound to strengthen this year as the Bank of England moves to hike interest rates faster than the market believes, Rochester added.  The markets expect U.K. interest rates to rise only by the second half of 2018. A Reuters poll in December expects the next hike only in the fourth quarter of 2018.  With better-than-expected economic data in recent months and growing expectations a Brexit deal can be forged, traders have turned more positive on the pound.  Net long bets on sterling are near their highest levels in more than three years, according to data released by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday, suggesting     some investors have warmed to the bullish sterling theme.   That optimism has also filtered through to the currency derivatives markets, with gauges of expected volatility plummeting to more than three-year lows.  The drop in expected price swings has gathered steam since Prime Minister Theresa May secured progress in the complicated process of leaving the EU last month - so much so that expected volatility in sterling in options with up to one-year maturities is now below even some major rivals, such as the Japanese yen and the euro.  But some investors remain unconvinced that sterling is a buy, pointing to structural weaknesses of the British economy such as widening deficits.  \u201cWe remain underweight on the pound as we see the balance of payments on a deteriorating trend,\u201d said Alessio de Longis, portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds, which manages $235 billion in global assets.

          "title": "IPhone addiction may be a virtue, not a vice for investors",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) investors are shrugging off concerns raised by two shareholders about kids getting hooked on iPhones, saying that for now a little addiction might not be a bad thing for profits.  Hedge fund JANA Partners LLC and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension fund said on Saturday that iPhone overuse could be hurting children\u2019s developing brains, an issue that may harm the company\u2019s long-term market value.  But some investors said the habit-forming nature of gadgets and social media are one reason why companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) added $630 billion to their market value in 2017.  \u201cWe invest in things that are addictive,\u201d said Apple shareholder Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management.  He also owns stock in coffee retailer Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), casino operator MGM Resorts International (MGM.N) and alcohol maker Constellation Brands Inc (STZ.N).  \u201cAddictive things are very profitable,\u201d Gerber said.   Still, the investment community is increasingly holding companies to higher social standards, and there is some concern that market-leading tech companies could draw attention from regulators much like alcohol, tobacco and gambling companies have in the past.  Alphabet and Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Facebook has said social media can be beneficial if used appropriately.  In a statement to Reuters, Apple said it has offered a range of controls on iPhones since 2008 that allow parents to restrict content, including apps, movies, websites, songs and books, as well as cellular data, password settings and other features.  \u201cEffectively anything a child could download or access online can be easily blocked or restricted by a parent,\u201d Apple said in the statement.  Apple shares fell marginally on Monday. CalSTRS holds $1.9 billion in Apple stock, a sliver of the company\u2019s nearly $900 billion market value, while JANA declined to disclose the size of its smaller stake.  \u201cBefore Apple speaks, I think it\u2019s too early to change the narrative\u201d for investors, said Peter Jones, vice president of research for Ferguson Wellman Capital Management, which has about 350,000 Apple shares.  Social media companies, not hardware makers, are more deserving of any addiction-related scrutiny, some said.   Jordan Waldrep, who invests in alcohol, tobacco and gambling stocks as manager of the USA Mutuals Vice Fund (VICEX.O), said blaming Apple for its customers\u2019 addiction was analogous to blaming makers of cigarette packs instead of tobacco companies.  \u201cThe social media, the cigarettes, are the addictive product,\u201d he said. Waldrep\u2019s Vice fund does not own Apple, but Waldrep said he would consider including social media companies.  Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager and vice president at Fort Pitt Capital Group, agreed that companies like Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snap Inc (SNAP.N) might be more at risk than Apple if investors and regulators push back on how much time people spend on mobile devices.  \u201cApple is just the delivery device,\u201d said Forrest, who said Fort Pitt has limited Apple holdings. \u201cIt\u2019s only compelling with software. Software is the dopamine releaser that keeps you coming back.\u201d  Twitter declined to comment and Snap could not immediately be reached.  The letter from JANA and CalSTRS recommends Apple set up a committee of child-development experts and make more new tools available to parents.  In its statement, Apple did not directly respond to the investors\u2019 demands but said changes are in store for its parental controls. It did not provide details.  \u201cWe are constantly looking for ways to make our experiences better,\u201d Apple said. \u201cWe have new features and enhancements planned for the future, to add functionality and make these tools even more robust.\u201d  The addiction issue gained notoriety when former Disney child star Selena Gomez said she canceled a 2016 world tour to go to therapy for depression and low self-esteem, feelings she linked to a social media addiction.  Fears about smartphone addiction have already kicked off  regulatory backlash. In December, the French education minister said mobile phones would be banned in schools, and draft legislation in France would require children under 16 to seek parental approval to open a Facebook account.  Even tech insiders are among the vocal critics of social media and its addictive potential.  \u201cApple Watches, Google Phones, Facebook, Twitter - they\u2019ve gotten so good at getting us to go for another click, another dopamine hit,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive, on Twitter.  John Streur, chief executive of Calvert Research and Management, an Apple shareholder that focuses on social responsibility, said it is plausible that tech devices may some day be understood to hold risks we do not currently understand well.  That would hurt investors if evidence later emerged that companies intentionally built features that create dependency and had evidence that doing so was unsafe.  For the time being, John Carey, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston, said concerns over the human impacts from being glued to screens are not likely to cut into profits. The company holds Apple stock, but the funds Carey manages do not.  \u201cI doubt there will be any impact on the use of smartphones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already addicted to them.\u201d  (Adds statement from Apple)  Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Additional reporting by Ross Kerber, April Joyner, Sinead Carew, David Ingram, Elizabeth Dilts and Stephen Nellis; Editing by Megan Davies, Meredith Mazzilli and Leslie Adler"

          "title": "Boeing shares have more room to fly in 2018: analysts",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Rising demand for jet sales pushed Boeing Co\u2019s (BA.N) stock to the top of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2017, and record cash flow to fuel projects, sustain dividends and buy back shares could give it another bumper year, analysts said.  After a resurgence in jet sales driven by a solid global economy and with most of its production issues behind it, Boeing has found itself flush with record free cash flow - a profitability measure widely watched by investors for industrial stocks.  \u201cWe believe Boeing shares are still moderately undervalued, particularly if the company can sustain free cash flow margins in the 13-15 percent range,\u201d Fort Pitt Capital Group founder Charles Smith told Reuters.  \u201cGiven our expectations for moderation in capex over the next couple years, along with continued efficiencies on the 787 Dreamliner, we think this can happen,\u201d said Smith, whose funds held a 0.04 percent stake in Boeing as of Sept. 30, according to Reuters data.  Smith said Boeing\u2019s third quarter free cash flow margin was 12.45 percent.  The company has increased its free cash flow from $1.83 billion in 2010 to an estimated $10.5 billion in 2017. That figure would be an increase of 34 percent from 2016.  The surge in cash flow has energized the company\u2019s shares, pushing up the stock price by more than 90 percent in 2017. Still, the stock trades at a slight discount to its aerospace peers. .DJUSAS  Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said if management executes on another year of growth, tax reform materializes and free cash flow multiples catch up with peers, one can expect \u201canother +50 percent year.\u201d  Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg recently confirmed that the company expects to grow operating cash flow annually through the end of the decade, adding that it remains committed to returning about 100 percent of free cash flow to investors.  Free cash flow points to a company\u2019s ability to expand production, develop new products, make acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt.  Boeing last month raised its quarterly dividend by 20 percent and replaced its existing $14 billion share buyback plan with a new $18 billion authorization.  Since the end of 2012, the world\u2019s biggest airplane producer has pumped back nearly $40 billion to its investors through dividend and share repurchases while still investing substantially in products, services and people.  Fort Pitt\u2019s Smith says Boeing\u2019s management is doing well allocating capital between new projects, acquisitions and buybacks and predicts a return on shareholder equity of 17-18 percent that gives shares a \u201cfair value\u201d estimate for 2018 of $300 to $360.  Boeing\u2019s shares were trading up 1 percent at $313.75 on Tuesday.  The company, however, has to overcome near-term challenges like its troubled aerial tanker refueling program and longer term concerns such as macroeconomic issues and possible supply chain problems, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Lalwani said.  But for now the stock remains popular among investors, with 13 out of 25 analysts rating it a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201cstrong buy\u201d.  \u201cIt\u2019s a bull market and Boeing is a classic kind of late stage bull market stock - mega cap, high quality, global orientation,\u201d said Kenneth Fisher, whose asset management firm owned about $70 million of Boeing stock as of Oct. 17.  Boeing said in September it will raise production of 787 Dreamliner jets to 14 a month in 2019 from 12 currently, indicating reviving faith in wide-body demand.  On Tuesday, Boeing said it delivered 763 jetliners in 2017, likely retaining the title of the world\u2019s biggest plane maker compared with European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA).

          "body": "FLORENCE, Italy (Reuters) - It\u2019s all a matter of taste.   Luxury labels are accustomed to tempting fashionistas, and now they\u2019re stretching from haute couture to haute cuisine.  Gucci opened a 50-seat restaurant, Gucci Osteria, in Florence on Tuesday where three-Michelin-star chef Massimo Bottura will serve up high-end dishes.   The Italian fashion house, owned by Kering, is not the only luxury company to foray into food; LVMH announced late last year it would open a second branch of its gourmet grocer La Grande Epicerie in Paris, days before Tiffany\u2019s & Co opened its Blue Box Cafe in New York.   \u201cThe big brands are following where their high-spending clients\u2019 cash is going,\u201d said Fabrizio Pini, professor and joint director of the International Master in Luxury Management of  Milan\u2019s MIP Politecnico business school.

In some cases, eateries can also be a way to make the most out of large, city-centre store sites as customers increasingly shop online.  The Gucci restaurant is sited behind the walls of the 14-century Palazzo della Mercanzia building, overlooking the city\u2019s most famous square, Piazza della Signoria. Visitors can treat themselves to the likes of Parmigiano Reggiano tortellini, Peruvian-inspired tostadas, pork belly buns and mushroom risotto for 20-30 euros per dish.

          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese officials on Tuesday called on the United States to take thorough measures to protect Japanese citizens a day after a U.S. helicopter made an emergency landing on the grounds of a hotel on the southern island of Okinawa.  The emergency landing, coming just days after a similar mishap, was the latest in a series of incidents involving U.S. military aircraft in Okinawa that have further fueled public opposition to the U.S. presence there.  Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera told a news conference that in a morning telephone call with U.S. counterpart James Mattis he had called on the United States to prevent any recurrences.  \u201cWe are asking the United States to take thorough measures,\u201d he said, adding that he intended to repeat the message when he meets U.S. Pacific Commander Harry Harris later this week.  Japanese media reported that Mattis had apologized for the latest incident, but Onodera made no reference to this, although he said he felt Mattis is \u201cthoroughly aware\u201d of the issue.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga echoed Onodera\u2019s concerns, telling a news conference that while U.S.-Japanese deterrence was important in an increasingly fraught regional security situation, the understanding and cooperation of Japanese locals was essential for the U.S. military to carry out its duties well.  \u201cThese accidents, which create fear on the part of local residents, must not happen,\u201d he added.   Resentment has simmered among residents of the southern Japanese island who bemoan what they see as an unfair burden in supporting the U.S. military presence in Japan.  Among recent incidents, a USMC transport helicopter made an emergency landing on an Okinawan beach on Saturday because of a faulty rotor. Earlier, a window fell from a military aircraft onto a school playground.  Located strategically at the edge of the East China Sea, Okinawa, which was under U.S. occupation until 1972, hosts some 30,000 military personnel living and working on bases that cover a fifth of the island.

          "title": "Sterling snaps three-day climb, but Brexit hopes support",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling weakened on Tuesday, snapping a three-day rising streak  as investors took profits, although expectations that Brexit talks will have a positive outcome continued to underpin the British currency.  External factors have also proved supportive for the pound, recently with the U.S. dollar struggling to gain much traction against its rivals in the opening days of the year.  \u201cWe expect to see progress towards securing a transitional deal (on leaving the European Union) in the coming months and that should be constructive for sterling,\u201d said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at MUFJ in London. He expects the pound to rise to 1.40 against the dollar over the next six months.  On Tuesday, sterling weakened as much as 0.5 percent to $1.3504 but remained within striking distance of a four-month high of $1.3614 hit last week.  Against the euro, it has been a more mixed picture, with sterling oscillating around the 88 cents line over the last month.   Jordan Rochester, a London-based FX strategist at Nomura, said sterling\u2019s weakness on Tuesday had been more about dollar strength.  \u201cToday is not a UK-specific story. It\u2019s more of a dollar and yen outperformance day,\u201d he said, referring to the Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to trim its purchases of long-dated government bonds in market operations.   Nomura expects the pound to strengthen this year as the Bank of England moves to hike interest rates faster than the market believes, Rochester added.  The markets expect U.K. interest rates to rise only by the second half of 2018. A Reuters poll in December expects the next hike only in the fourth quarter of 2018.  With better-than-expected economic data in recent months and growing expectations a Brexit deal can be forged, traders have turned more positive on the pound.  Net long bets on sterling are near their highest levels in more than three years, according to data released by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday, suggesting     some investors have warmed to the bullish sterling theme.   That optimism has also filtered through to the currency derivatives markets, with gauges of expected volatility plummeting to more than three-year lows.  The drop in expected price swings has gathered steam since Prime Minister Theresa May secured progress in the complicated process of leaving the EU last month - so much so that expected volatility in sterling in options with up to one-year maturities is now below even some major rivals, such as the Japanese yen and the euro.  But some investors remain unconvinced that sterling is a buy, pointing to structural weaknesses of the British economy such as widening deficits.  \u201cWe remain underweight on the pound as we see the balance of payments on a deteriorating trend,\u201d said Alessio de Longis, portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds, which manages $235 billion in global assets.

          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday defended his son over drunken remarks made between visits to strip clubs and taped illicitly that drew criticism for being derogatory of women.   The recording, aired late on Monday by Israeli Hadashot News, was made in 2015 while Netanyahu\u2019s son, Yair, toured  strip clubs in Tel Aviv while partying with two friends.  In it, Yair Netanyahu and his friends are heard teasing each other on who has paid for what during their night out on the town. When one of the friends tells Yair he spotted him 400 Shekels (about $115), Yair says: \u201cNo, that was for the hooker.\u201d  In other portions of the recording Yair offers \u201cto arrange\u201d an ex-girlfriend for his friend in order to settle his debts, appears to rate strippers\u2019 skills and appearances and is embarrassed by a late-night phone-call from his mother.  Yair issued a statement in which he said the news report was salacious, the recording illegal and that he was inebriated at the time.    \u201cI said ridiculous things about women and about other people, which should not have been said. These things do not represent me, the values I was raised on and what I believe in. I regret these and apologise to anyone hurt by them,\u201d said the statement, quoted in Israeli media.  The recording has made headlines in Israel, where Yair was criticised for using a state-funded car and driver to take him around strip clubs along with his state-funded security guard.  \u201cThis is terrible moral bankruptcy. Debased, disgusting, rude behavior objectifying women while accompanied by a car and security funded by the state,\u201d opposition lawmaker Shelly Yachimovich said on Facebook.   Speaking with reporters in Jerusalem on Tuesday, the prime minister said his son was right to apologize. \u201cMy wife and I raised our children to respect any person and to respect all women,\u201d Netanyahu said.  One of the friends Netanyahu was with is the son of an Israeli businessman, Kobi Maimon, who has a stake in Israel\u2019s offshore natural gas fields. At the time of the recording Netanyahu\u2019s government was finalizing a deal for their development.   \u201cBro, my dad just arranged 20 billion dollars for your dad and you can\u2019t spot me 400 Shekels?\u201d Yair told his friend jokingly as laughter was heard.   In a written response issued to the report on Monday, Netanyahu said he was unaware of his son\u2019s friendship with Maimon and that it had no bearing on the gas deal, nor did Yair have any knowledge of it.   He called the report wicked gossip and said the media was hounding his family as part of a campaign against his right-wing government.  Netanyahu, who has a sometimes adversarial relationship with Israeli media, is under police investigation for alleged corruption in two criminal cases. He denies wrongdoing.   The 26-year-old Yair Netanyahu has found himself the center of controversy in the past.    In September he drew anger in Israel and abroad for posting a cartoon using what the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors anti-Semitism worldwide, described as anti-Semitic imagery in a Facebook post mocking some of his father\u2019s critics.   In August, he made another headline-grabbing post after a protester was killed during a white nationalist rally in the U.S. state of Virginia, that suggested hard-left organizations pose more of a danger than neo-Nazi groups.

          "title": "UPDATE 2-Euro zone bond yields up on new supply; US, Japanese gains",
          "body": "* Germany, Netherlands and Austria sell bonds on Tuesday  * Yields on all three well up from mid-December  * BoJ buying pattern pushes U.S. Treasury yields up  * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Recasts with rise in yields)  By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Fanny Potkin  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Euro zone government bond yields rose on Tuesday, following a wave of new debt issuances from the bloc\u2019s top-rated issuers and a rise in U.S. and Japanese yields.  Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a 10-month high and 20-to-40 year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields set one-month highs after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) trimmed the amount of its JGB purchases, fuelling talk the central bank may wind back monetary stimulus this year.  \u201cThe fear of this being a prelude to BoJ reduction in purchases is misplaced, but it did move the market this morning along with the strong Japanese wages data,\u201d said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet.  The sell off in U.S. and Japanese bond markets put upward pressure on euro zone bond yields on a day when three countries in the bloc held their first auctions of 2018 and Portugal and Italy announced syndicated bond deals.  Germany, the Netherlands and Austria sold more than 3.5 billion euros ($4.2 billion) of bonds between them, receiving strong demand from investors.  Italy mandated banks to manage the sale of a new 20-year bond, while Portugal also mandated banks for an upcoming 10-year bond sale.  \u201cWith the announcement from Portugal that was quite well-flagged, and Italy following suit with a 20-year benchmark, (that) created a lot for the market to digest,\u201d said Michael Leister, rates strategist at Commerzbank.  \u201cWhat we are seeing now is simply the market struggling to defend the levels it had been trading before.\u201d  In late trade, euro zone bond yields were 2-5 basis points (bps) higher on the day - led by Italy.  Italy\u2019s 10-year bond yield was up 5 bps at 2.03 percent , pushing out the gap over benchmark German Bund yields to 158 bps from 155 bps on Monday.  German 10-year bond yields were up 2.5 bps at 0.45 percent, well above the mid-December level of 0.30 percent.  The Dutch equivalent was 2 bps higher at 0.55 percent but was about 18 bps higher than its December low, while Austria has seen its 10-year borrowing costs increase 18 bps over the past month to 0.59 percent.  In a continuation of a recent trend, southern European debt outperformed, and the gap between Spanish and German bond yields was at its tightest since September.  Normally, an improvement in economic conditions would cause investors to be cautious about buying government bonds as it makes an early end to the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying scheme more likely.  But with inflation yet to show a sustained increase, investors would feel reasonably safe buying debt.  \u201cTo me, the current Bund yield level makes sense given economic data looks rock solid. The only thing we\u2019re all waiting for is signs of inflationary pressure,\u201d said Martin van Vliet, senior rates strategist at ING.

          "title": "Netanyahu defends son taped illicitly outside strip club",
          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday defended his son over drunken remarks made between visits to strip clubs and taped illicitly that drew criticism for being derogatory of women.   The recording, aired late on Monday by Israeli Hadashot News, was made in 2015 while Netanyahu\u2019s son, Yair, toured  strip clubs in Tel Aviv while partying with two friends.  In it, Yair Netanyahu and his friends are heard teasing each other on who has paid for what during their night out on the town. When one of the friends tells Yair he spotted him 400 Shekels (about $115), Yair says: \u201cNo, that was for the hooker.\u201d  In other portions of the recording Yair offers \u201cto arrange\u201d an ex-girlfriend for his friend in order to settle his debts, appears to rate strippers\u2019 skills and appearances and is embarrassed by a late-night phone-call from his mother.  Yair issued a statement in which he said the news report was salacious, the recording illegal and that he was inebriated at the time.    \u201cI said ridiculous things about women and about other people, which should not have been said. These things do not represent me, the values I was raised on and what I believe in. I regret these and apologise to anyone hurt by them,\u201d said the statement, quoted in Israeli media.  The recording has made headlines in Israel, where Yair was criticised for using a state-funded car and driver to take him around strip clubs along with his state-funded security guard.  \u201cThis is terrible moral bankruptcy. Debased, disgusting, rude behavior objectifying women while accompanied by a car and security funded by the state,\u201d opposition lawmaker Shelly Yachimovich said on Facebook.   Speaking with reporters in Jerusalem on Tuesday, the prime minister said his son was right to apologize. \u201cMy wife and I raised our children to respect any person and to respect all women,\u201d Netanyahu said.  One of the friends Netanyahu was with is the son of an Israeli businessman, Kobi Maimon, who has a stake in Israel\u2019s offshore natural gas fields. At the time of the recording Netanyahu\u2019s government was finalizing a deal for their development.   \u201cBro, my dad just arranged 20 billion dollars for your dad and you can\u2019t spot me 400 Shekels?\u201d Yair told his friend jokingly as laughter was heard.   In a written response issued to the report on Monday, Netanyahu said he was unaware of his son\u2019s friendship with Maimon and that it had no bearing on the gas deal, nor did Yair have any knowledge of it.   He called the report wicked gossip and said the media was hounding his family as part of a campaign against his right-wing government.  Netanyahu, who has a sometimes adversarial relationship with Israeli media, is under police investigation for alleged corruption in two criminal cases. He denies wrongdoing.   The 26-year-old Yair Netanyahu has found himself the center of controversy in the past.    In September he drew anger in Israel and abroad for posting a cartoon using what the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors anti-Semitism worldwide, described as anti-Semitic imagery in a Facebook post mocking some of his father\u2019s critics.   In August, he made another headline-grabbing post after a protester was killed during a white nationalist rally in the U.S. state of Virginia, that suggested hard-left organizations pose more of a danger than neo-Nazi groups.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lenders to U.S. mid-sized businesses are increasingly concerned about the higher levels of debt held by middle market companies versus a year ago, as well as what they consider to be less restrictive leveraged loan documents, a survey by Carl Marks Advisors found.  Higher leverage levels and borrower-friendly loan agreements, the result of highly competitive market conditions last year that pushed lenders to make such concessions, could impact loan portfolios if business performance comes under pressure.  Carl Marks Advisors, a mid-market focused corporate restructuring and investment banking firm, conducted the national online survey in December 2017 of 190 participants from US middle market lending-related fields, including traditional bank lenders, alternative lenders, legal and accounting advisors, restructuring advisors, private equity and hedge fund investors, and other financial and business consultants.  \u201cThis is now the third-longest economic expansion in US history, so it is getting a little bit long-dated. Companies are not necessarily improving and there is a lot of capital - both debt and equity - chasing too few deals,\u201d Patrick Flynn, managing director at Carl Marks Advisors, said in an interview ahead of the survey\u2019s release. \u201cBut while there is relatively more concern today than a year ago, it is not necessarily a predictor that the next contraction is any closer.\u201d  The survey found that 76% of respondents are more concerned than they were at the beginning of 2017 about leverage levels at US middle market companies.  \u201cIn 2017 many a transaction has added debt, but there has not been a lot of value created,\u201d said Joseph D\u2019Angelo, a partner at Carl Marks Advisors. \u201cThere are not a lot of unencumbered assets left to borrow more money against. If a company doesn\u2019t perform through that, it will likely see a restructuring.\u201d  Leverage on middle market institutional deals increased in 2017 to 5.51x total debt to Ebitda compared to 4.95x in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of a company\u2019s operating performance.  Regarding concessions that lenders have offered to borrowers and private equity sponsors in the face of aggressive market conditions, 48% of respondents said they considered loan documents executed in 2017 to be less restrictive for borrowers than those executed immediately prior to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Thirty-five percent said they did not consider documents to be less restrictive, while 17% said they were unsure.  Middle market covenant-lite issuance reached an all-time high of US$25bn in 2017, LPC data show. By comparison, before the financial crisis, 2007 middle market covenant-lite volume totaled US$7.49bn.  \u201cThere is a fully functioning credit market and pressure to deploy capital remains robust. It\u2019s hard to predict what will trigger the pendulum back towards lender-friendly terms. Currently it seems that lender pushback is still being solved with price and terms,\u201d Flynn said.  Loan document concessions resulting in covenant-lite loans or springing covenants with lower triggers are of primary concern for respondents in 2018, followed by the allowance of add backs to Ebitda calculations.  Covenant-lite refers to loans that are stripped of certain lender protections, including financial maintenance tests requiring the borrower to meet monthly or quarterly performance standards. Such tests serve as early warning signs in a potential default scenario. Boosting Ebitda, meanwhile, can increase a company\u2019s financial flexibility with respect to incurring additional debt or setting restricted payments, thereby increasing credit risk and weakening investor protections.  \u201cAs long as there are as many different funding sources and they keep raising capital, there are no forces that would influence loan documents to tighten up,\u201d said D\u2019Angelo.  Investor demand for exposure to middle market lending strategies fueled record fundraising of US$69bn in 2017, toppling the US$60bn booked in 2016, LPC data show.   As for types of lenders expected to face the greatest challenges in their loan portfolios this year, 26% of respondents said mezzanine lenders are at the top of the list. Business Development Companies (BDCs) were next in line with 23%, 18% said distressed investors and 14% selected traditional banks. Specialty finance companies and direct lenders were tied at 6.84% each, while bank asset-based lenders and equipment finance companies are ranked least likely to face trouble, at less than 5% each.  \u201cMany BDCs make investments in much smaller companies, which can be more vulnerable to economic contraction. BDCs also have a higher cost of capital relative to regulated banks, which dictates looking to invest in places that justify their cost of capital, which can also translate into added risk,\u201d said Flynn.  Despite heightened concerns about leverage and loan documentation, respondents were notably split regarding technical and payment defaults in 2018. Forty-three percent said deafults would increase and the same share said they would stay the same this year.  \u201cWe don\u2019t really expect much difference in 2018. If the economy can continue to grow, we expect to see more sector specific situations. Changes continue to ripple through healthcare with downward pressure on both federal and state budgets,\u201d said D\u2019Angelo. \u201cThe bitter chill has given the energy sector a boost. With prices increasing, there is more confidence around the table to\u00a0do more constructive deals. We could even see some M&A there.\u201d   Reporting by Leela Parker Deo; Editing by Lynn Adler and Jon Methven"

          "body": "ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss Alpine resort of Zermatt airlifted guests by helicopter on Tuesday after heavy snow and a power cut stranded thousands of visitors.  An estimated 13,000 people were stuck in Zermatt after snow closed mountain lifts, ski runs, walking paths and train services to the village.  With the onset of the wintery weather, avalanche danger in the rugged region of Wallis that includes Zermatt near the Italian border is now rated as \u201cvery great\u201d, the highest level, according to the Swiss Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research.   In the town of Visp, about 30 km (20 miles) down the valley from Zermatt, 20 people were evacuated from their homes after a mud- and snowslide sent debris into a portion of the village, Swiss broadcaster SRG reported on Tuesday. Nobody was injured.  However, the tourist office said there was no reason for concern in Zermatt. Town officials say the airlift service was just arranged for those wishing to leave.  \u201cPower has returned, there\u2019s still the chance that it could go out ... but at this time things look good,\u201d a tourist office spokeswoman said. \u201cThe atmosphere in the village is relaxed and comfortable.\u201d  Helicopters flew for about two hours on Tuesday afternoon, she said.  Guests seeking to leave the car-free village at the foot of the Matterhorn were flown to Taesch, about 5 km (3 miles) away.   From there, Zermatt had enlisted buses in place of rail service to take people further down the valley following the opening of the road. Helicopters were also used to transport people seeking to reach Zermatt, officials said.  Swiss mountain communities have been in the spotlight for geological risks since August, when the side of a mountain collapsed in the southern canton of Grisons, killing eight hikers.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - US private equity firm KKR\u2019s \u20ac6.83bn acquisition of Unilever\u2019s margarine and spreads business will be backed with \u20ac5.65bn-equivalent of debt financing, banking sources said.  The maker of Knorr soup and Dove soap announced the deal in December, hours after Reuters reported that KKR had entered exclusive talks to buy the business after outbidding rivals.  Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and KKR Capital Markets are expected to lead the debt financing, alongside a number of other banks that could include BNP Paribas, ING, Lloyds, RBC and UniCredit, although no banks have received a mandate as of yet, banking sources said.  The debt financing is expected to include a \u20ac3.9bn-equivalent term loan \u2014 which will be mainly denominated in euros and will include some US dollars and Polish zloty \u2014 as well as around \u20ac1.050bn of senior unsecured notes and a \u20ac700m revolving credit facility, the sources said.  The debt financing is expected to launch for syndication in the first half of February, the sources said.  The deal has been widely anticipated by debt investors, eager to invest in new paper in a jumbo event-driven financing.  \u201cUnilever spreads is a resilient business that generates a lot of cash flow and that makes it very attractive from a debt perspective. There is a lot of liquidity out there and this is a hotly anticipated, must-do deal that funds will want exposure to,\u201d a senior banker said.  The brands to be sold include Becel, Flora, Country Crock and Blue Band.  Unilever put the business up for sale in April 2017, following a review of its assets prompted by February\u2019s unsolicited US$143bn takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz.  KKR has a long history in the consumer sector and it has investments in India\u2019s Coffee Day Resorts and Chinese white goods maker Qingdao Haier.

          "body": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African tribal leader has agreed to a more transparent structure for a 175 million rand ($14 million) community trust funded by Anglo American Platinum (Amplats), a move that aims to curb unrest around the firm\u2019s most profitable mine.  The changes relate to the Mapela Trust, which was set up to fund development projects in communities around Amplats\u2019 Mogalakwena operation, the world\u2019s largest open-pit platinum mine and the Anglo American unit\u2019s main cash spinner.  The structure of the fund has proved a flashpoint, with local communities saying the way cash was spent has not transparent and too much authority was given to the local chief, known as Kgoshi, to determine where money was invested.  Protests over two years ago temporarily closed the mine and community leaders had threatened more action to demand changes.  Lawyers representing local communities told Reuters a deal between Amplats and the tribal chief had been reached. \u201cThere is a significant dilution of the chief\u2019s power across the board,\u201d Johan Lorenzen, one of the lawyers, said.  Amplats confirmed this. \u201cWe have signed the agreement. The issues have been resolved,\u201d spokeswoman Mpumi Sithole said.  Under the new structure, four of the Mapela Trust\u2019s nine trustees will be elected directly by local communities instead of just two that were picked by the chief to represent them.  The other trustees include an independent chairperson, the Kgoshi, a member of a traditional council, a member elected by village chiefs and a senior Amplats representative.  Amplats\u2019 Sithole said the community would elect their representatives before any cash was allocated to local projects.  Protests over the fund that erupted more than two years ago prompted the temporary closure of the Mogalakwena mine, leading to the loss of 8,600 ounces of its annual 200,000-plus ounces of production.  Local communities had hired prominent South African human rights lawyer Richard Spoor to spearhead their case.  Other South African mining companies have also been cutting deals with tribal leaders who have royal titles and feudal-style control over their former homelands, often islands of rural poverty where most blacks were confined under apartheid.  The bulk of the platinum reserves in South Africa, the world\u2019s top producer of the precious metal, lie in or near these tribal areas.  Impala Platinum and Lonmin have also had operations disrupted by community protests linked to deals with tribal chiefs.  Social and labor violence, alongside soaring costs and depressed world platinum prices, have made two-thirds of South Africa\u2019s platinum operations unprofitable at current prices, according to the country\u2019s Chamber of Mines.

The Federal Constitutional Court overturned a ruling by a lower court that ordered the deportation of the man, who was born and raised in Germany, after he was convicted of traveling to Syria and supporting a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d.  Nearly a thousand people are believed to have left Germany to fight with Islamist militants. Some are now returning as the jihadist group\u2019s presence in the Middle East crumbles.  The court ruling said the 30 year-old man, who was not identified by name, went to Syria with his wife and children in 2013 where he supported an Islamist militia group, After his return to Germany, he transferred money to an account related to Islamic State, it said.  He was initially sentenced to three years and six months in prison in Germany in 2015, but immigration authorities ordered his immediate deportation to Turkey.  The high court called for checks.  \u201cIt is constitutionally necessary for responsible authorities and courts to be informed about the conditions in a destination country before a deportation,\u201d the court said.  Germany is home to around three million people of Turkish descent, some of who have German citizenship, while others only hold Turkish passports.  A growing number of Turks have sought asylum in Germany since the 2016 failed military coup in Turkey.  Reporting By Riham Alkousaa"

          "title": "Zimbabwe's opposition faces rocky road to election as leader mulls exit",
          "body": "HARARE (Reuters) - If Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai were to stand down - as he has hinted - the party he founded would face immediate instability and could even split, handing a gift to new President Emmerson Mnangagwa in an election this year.  The most visible opposition figure in the southern African nation since independence from Britain in 1980, Tsvangirai said on Monday it was time for the older generation to make way for younger leaders in the party.  Mnangagwa, 75, rose to power last November after Robert Mugabe stood down following a de facto coup, ending a 37-year reign marked by economic mismanagement, corruption and vote rigging allegations.  Investors and Western governments who cheered the end of Mugabe\u2019s rule will be closely watching the election for evidence Mnangagwa can run a free and fair vote and turn a new page in Zimbabwe\u2019s history.  It was expected that Tsvangirai\u2019s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) would pose a robust challenge to Mnangagwa\u2019s ruling ZANU-PF.  But that prospect may now be in jeopardy.  Tsvangirai, who has been battling cancer for several years and looked frail at a meeting with Mnangagwa last week, did not explicitly say he would stand down and his spokesman said he could not comment further.  Tsvangirai, 65, has three deputies, one who was elected and two others he handpicked in 2016 to help him run the party, a move that still irks some MDC members.  The MDC has known division twice before, in 2005 and in 2014 following a heavy election defeat to the ZANU-PF. And, though analysts said it was good in the long term for Tsvangirai to relinquish the MDC leadership after nearly 20 years in charge, the succession had to be handled carefully.  \u201cBehind the scenes, the three party vice presidents are gladiating to take over from Tsvangirai,\u201d said Eldred Masunungure, a political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe.   \u201cIt should be a democratic process and not an autocratic change of power. If Tsvangirai takes that route it will tear the party asunder. It will be a sad day if Tsvangirai\u2019s departure  means the death of the MDC.\u201d   The MDC has weakened progressively since 2008, when Tsvangirai defeated Mugabe in the first round of voting.      After opting out of the run-off alleging violence by the army against its supporters, the MDC formed a unity government with ZANU-PF that helped stabilize the economy until Tsvangirai was defeated in a 2013 presidential election by Mugabe.      A senior MDC official said Tsvangirai was still considering whether to call for a special leadership congress or have the party appoint a new presidential candidate who he could help campaign ahead of elections.  \u201cThe MDC is at a very critical moment and the issue of transitioning to a new leader has been weighing heavily on president Tsvangirai,\u201d the MDC executive told Reuters, asking for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.  Tsvangirai, 65, the self-taught son of a bricklayer who worked in a rural mine to support his family, cut his political teeth in the labor movement as a mine foreman, later becoming a top trade unionist.  In 1999 he was elected founding MDC president and built his political career as a one of the only people willing to stand up to Mugabe, making him difficult to replace.  He will have to juggle regional, tribal and gender considerations in looking for a successor.  \u201cThose are salient issues that the MDC cannot run away from,\u201d said Masunungure.

          "body": "ROME (Reuters) - Nearly 170 people, including mayors, businessmen and local administrators, were arrested on Tuesday in a large anti-mafia blitz in Italy and Germany against clan members who controlled restaurants, garbage collection and funeral services.  Police and investigators told a news conference that most of the arrests, which totalled 169 by early afternoon, were carried out in the southern Italian region of Calabria, base of the \u2018Ndrangheta crime group. More could be apprehended, they said.  In recent years the \u2018Ndrangheta has overtaken the Cosa Nostra, or Sicilian mob, in drugs and arms trafficking and extortion rackets, extending its tentacles into northern Europe, the United States and Canada.  In Germany, police also arrested about a dozen men, as part of the same operation, on suspicion of blackmail, attempted murder, money laundering and other organised crime offences.  Police searched six apartments and four restaurants in Germany and confiscated cash, mobile phones, documents and storage devices, they said.  Investigators said the clans of the Farao and Marincola families, based in the Calabrian city of Ciro Marina, had infiltrated businesses in both countries, particularly firms involved in wine, food, garbage collection and funeral services.  At least three Italian mayors were arrested, including the mayor of Ciro Marina, as well as a number of city councillors.  The clan members forced restaurants to buy meat, fish, wine and other produce from complicit retailers or wholesalers associated with the mob.  The farmers\u2019 group Coldiretti estimates that at least 5,000 restaurants in Italy are in criminal hands and that the so-called \u201cagro-mafia\u201d business, including harvesting and distribution, is worth about 21.8 billion euros a year.    The clans also took control of some private garbage collection and recycling companies as well as funeral services, forcing people to use them instead of others.  In at least one case, investigators found links between the \u2018Ndrangheta and managers of a government-financed migrant shelter on the Calabrian coast.  Most of the tens of thousands of migrants who have made the dangerous crossing of the Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe land first in Sicily but many are later moved to shelters on the mainland, including Calabria.  Arrests were also made in several regions of central and northern Italy.  Eurojust, the Netherlands-based group that helps coordinate investigations and prosecutions of cross-border crime in the European Union, said in a statement that some of the Italian food producers were used as front companies to launder illicit profits made through other criminal activities.  There are believed to be about 100 \u2018Ndrangheta families in Calabria, and they have become more successful than their Sicilian counterparts because their family ties are closer.  The \u2018Ngrangheta\u2019s more horizontal structure - which gives families more independence - has made it harder for investigators to crack than the Sicilian mob, which is based on a hierarchical structure with fewer top bosses.

Angry over the revelation that she was paid significantly less than male peers, the respected China specialist quit her post to fight against what she called the \u201csecretive and illegal BBC pay culture\u201d.  Her resignation came after pay disclosures by the BBC, which is funded by a fee levied on TV viewers in Britain, dismayed many of its female staff by showing apparent discrepancies between what men and women were paid for similar work.  \u201cThe brilliant women working at all levels of the BBC deserve better,\u201d said Matt Hancock, newly appointed minister for culture and media, during a hastily arranged debate on BBC pay in parliament.  He also suggested that some of its prominent men were paid too much by a publicly funded organization - a charge often leveled at the BBC by rival British media and other critics.  \u201cThe BBC have begun to act and I welcome that, but more action, much more action is needed, especially when BBC foreign editors can earn more than Her Majesty\u2019s ambassadors in the same jurisdiction,\u201d he said.  Lawmaker Damian Collins, who chairs parliament\u2019s media committee, announced he had invited the BBC\u2019s Director-General Tony Hall to appear before the committee to answer questions about pay inequality at a session this month.  Collins also invited Gracie to give evidence during the same session and said the committee may also hear from other BBC reporters, raising the prospect of uncomfortable scenes for Hall and BBC management as a whole.  \u201cHave been invited to give evidence to parliamentary selected committee on #equalpay for #BBCwomen. Yes! Let\u2019s sort this pay mess now,\u201d Gracie said on Twitter.  Separately, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, in charge of enforcing anti-discrimination laws, said it was asking the BBC for information about its pay policy and the facts in Gracie\u2019s case.  \u201cWe will consider whether further action is required based on this information,\u201d said the commission, which can use courts and tribunals to enforce people\u2019s rights.  The BBC did not comment on the statements from the commission or from Collins, but reiterated that its gender pay gap was significantly better than the national average.   Hall has pledged to close the gender pay gap by 2020.  Gracie has disclosed that she was paid 135,000 pounds  ($182,440) a year as China Editor.

          "body": "YANGON (Reuters) - Calls grew on Tuesday for the release of two Reuters journalists in Myanmar who are facing accusations of breaching the country\u2019s Official Secrets Act, with former U.S. President Bill Clinton urging that they be freed immediately.  The reporters, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12. They are due to make their second appearance in court in the main city of Yangon on Wednesday.  The two had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a military crackdown that followed militant attacks on security forces.  \u201cA free press is critical to a free society - the detention of journalists anywhere is unacceptable. The Reuters journalists being held in Myanmar should be released immediately,\u201d Clinton said in a Twitter post.  Clinton was U.S. president for much of the 1990s when the United States pressed Myanmar\u2019s then military rulers to release democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi from years of house arrest.  Suu Kyi won a 2015 election and formed a government in early 2016, although she is barred by the constitution from becoming president. She has made no public comment on the case of the two Reuters reporters. Her spokesman has said the case would be handled according to the law.  The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying the two reporters were \u201carrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces.\u201d   It said they had \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media\u201d.  The Official Secrets Act dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.  Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power referred in a post on Twitter to the detention of the two reporters as \u201can outrage & symptom of a world without credible US leadership\u201d.  Government officials from nations such as the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for the release of the reporters.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, Katina Adams, reiterated Washington\u2019s deep concern about the prosecution of the journalists.  \u201cWe call for their immediate and unconditional release, and for the charges against them to be dropped,\u201d she said. \u201cA free press is vital to Burma\u2019s transition and to becoming a viable democracy, and we want Burma\u2019s democracy to succeed.\u201d  Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the reporters.  \u201cAs they near their hearing date, it remains entirely clear that they are innocent of any wrongdoing,\u201d Adler said in a statement on Monday.  A group of Myanmar reporters asked the government on Monday for details about the arrest of the two, arguing that the case could have implications for the ability of journalists to do their jobs.  Authorities have blocked most media access to the north of Rakhine State, where Rohingya militant attacks on the security forces on Aug. 25 sparked the military crackdown.  The United Nations has condemned the Myanmar military campaign as ethnic cleansing. Buddhist-majority Myanmar has rejected the accusation.  The Committee to Protect Journalists also called on Myanmar to release the two reporters.  An independent Myanmar media outlet, the Development Media Group, which is based in and focuses on coverage of events in Rakhine State, also called for the release of the pair.

          "body": "* Dollar index hits 11-day high  * Yen hits five-day high after BoJ trims buying in long-dated JGBs  By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed  NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, recovering further from last week\u2019s decline to the lowest in more than three months, which drew bargain hunters.  The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was up 0.28 percent at 92.62. The index fell to 91.751 on January 2, its lowest since September 20.  \u201cI think we came into this week with the dollar having been beat up over the better part of the last four weeks,\u201d said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst, at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.  \u201cA lot of the dollar selling that carried over from late 2017 and into this year was probably a little bit overdone,\u201d he said.  The euro extended losses from the previous session and slipped 0.38 percent to $1.192. On Thursday, it had hit a nearly four-month high of $1.2089.  \u201cWe are seeing a little bit of the optimism surrounding the euro fade a little,\u201d Esiner said.  \u201cWhile euro zone data continues to paint a picture of an economy that closed out 2017 with very strong momentum, there continues to be a significant lack of inflation that will ultimately keep the pace of ECB normalization very, very cautious,\u201d he said.  In recent weeks, the euro rallied on expectations for a shift in European Central Bank monetary policy this year, but weakened after Friday\u2019s cooler-than-expected reading of the euro zone\u2019s December consumer price index.  The dollar fell against the yen after the Bank of Japan trimmed its purchases of long-dated government bonds in market operations, stoking speculation the central bank could start to wind down its huge stimulus policy this year.  Since it adopted its yield-curve-control policy in 2016, the BOJ has occasionally tweaked its bond operations, with officials saying any changes are meant to keep bond yields in line with its policy goal and not to telegraph hints on its future policy .  The Japanese currency hit a five-day high on Tuesday.  Most economists surveyed in a Reuters poll in December said the BoJ would start scaling back its stimulus in late 2018 or after.  Sterling weakened as investors took profits after a recent rally although expectations that Brexit talks will have a positive outcome continued to underpin the British currency.

The blast targeted a police truck close to a high security area where the provincial assembly and other government offices are located. A suicide bomber was believed to have walked up to the truck and blown himself up, senior police officer Abdul Razzaq Cheema told Reuters.  The bodies of five policemen and two civilians, as well as the wounded victims, were brought to the Civil Hospital, Dr Waseem Baig told Reuters, adding that death toll could climb as some of the injured were in serious condition.  The attack took place hours after the provincial chief minister, Sanaullah Zehri, resigned, although there was no indication that the blast was connected to provincial politics.  Zehri quit after some members of his PML Nawaz party rebelled against him to back a no-confidence motion in the provincial assembly, where he no longer commanded majority support.      Balochistan province is an important leg in the $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor of energy and infrastructure projects that China hopes to build as part of its \u201cbelt and road\u201d initiative.

          "body": "CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Two mothers have approached a court in south India seeking help to \u201cfree\u201d their daughters from a spinning mill where they work, raising questions on the freedom of movement of thousands of women employed in the Indian textile and garment industry.  Ellamal Raman, 17, and her cousin Bhuvaneshwari, 18, have not been allowed to leave the KPR Mill Limited\u2019s Karumathampatti premises in Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu state since September, according to their mothers.  In their petition to the court - heard on Tuesday - the mothers said that the teenagers have developed severe rashes on their hands, have been bitten by bed bugs and require treatment.  \u201cMy daughter has called home many times since, begging me to bring her back home,\u201d Raman\u2019s mother Chinnaponnu told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  \u201cLast night she was crying and saying she can\u2019t do the work. She has rashes on her hands and the mill won\u2019t let them out.\u201d  KPR Mills Limited - one of the largest manufacturers of yarn in the region, producing approximately 90,000 metric tonnes of cotton annually - said the women were being fairly treated.  Thangavelu Karrupasamy, a manager at the mills, said the girls were being paid minimum wages of 332 rupees ($5) per day and their medical needs were being taken care of.  \u201cSince they joined only in September, they are entitled leave to go home only later this month, during Pongal (harvest festival),\u201d he said. \u201cThe police have come and checked on the girls and we have asked the parents to come to the mill.\u201d  There are more than 1,500 mills in Tamil Nadu, the biggest hub for textile and manufacturers in India, employing up to 400,000 workers to turn cotton into yarn, fabric and clothes.  A majority of the young workers are drawn from poor families and are housed in hostels within the factory or mill premises.  The workers, mostly women, are confined to their hostels after their shifts and are only allowed a weekly visit to the neighborhood market with escorts, campaigners say.  \u201cLike most mills, this one also has high fenced walls and a lot of security,\u201d said Raj Kumar, the lawyer representing the two mothers.  \u201cIt is impossible for anyone to enter or leave the mill premises without the permission of the management.\u201d  The mothers had not been allowed to remove the two teenagers, Kumar said.  On Tuesday, the court directed the police to produce the teenagers before them on Jan. 11, the next date of hearing.

          "body": "DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil\u2019s price rally this year to its highest since May 2015 may seem a source of glee for OPEC, but some in the producer group fear the gains could prompt shale companies to crank open their spigots and flood the market.  Benchmark Brent crude rose further above $68 a barrel on Tuesday, supported by oil output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia that are due to run until the end of 2018.  The surge comes as a welcome boost for the revenues of oil-producing nations, many still reeling from a price collapse that started in mid-2014 when crude began to fall steeply from above $100 per barrel due to oversupply.   Some in OPEC are worried a prolonged rally could stimulate more U.S. shale oil output, however, creating more oversupply that could weigh on prices and market share.  \u201cWe all are excited about the rally and want to see if it will be sustainable during the year, as it will certainly whet the appetite of shale producers,\u201d an official from an OPEC country said.  The oil minister of Iran, OPEC\u2019s third-largest producer, said on Tuesday that the organization\u2019s members were not keen on increased prices as such gains would encourage more shale production.  OPEC has no formal target for oil prices. However, Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s top producer, wants to see crude above $60 to boost the valuation of its national oil company Aramco before an initial public offering of shares this year and to reduce the gap in its state budget, Saudi sources have said.  OPEC sources say Saudi Arabia has become a strong advocate of higher prices, a shift from a more moderate stance in the past, and Saudi officials have downplayed the threat of a boost in shale production.  Even so, U.S. production is expected soon to rise above 10 million barrels per day, close to Saudi levels, due largely to soaring output from shale drillers, government data shows. [EIA/M]    OPEC officials also think the 2018 rally has been mainly driven by unrest in Iran, rather than a tighter balance between supply and demand, giving rise to concern it may not last.  \u201cOil prices rose because of the political situation in Iran,\u201d an OPEC source said. \u201cThere is a worry now that this would be followed by a sharp decline in prices.\u201d  A third OPEC source said market fundamentals did not justify the price rally.   \u201cIt is only politics that is changing the mood. The push in prices will mean the peak is near and hence prices will give up some of the gains.\u201d  While OPEC sources say oil market fundamentals remain strong on the back of the supply cuts, others are worried that economic growth in consuming countries could slow and higher prices might encourage some producers to pump above their output target.

          "body": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer on Tuesday pleaded with voters on Tuesday to let the federal government keep levying taxes when they decide on a new public finance law in March.  Under Switzerland\u2019s system of direct democracy, voters on March 4 will have their say on extending the federal government\u2019s right to levy federal income tax and value-added tax.  The direct federal tax and the sales tax together contributed about two-thirds of the Swiss central government\u2019s budget, bringing in around 43.5 billion Swiss francs ($44.25 billion) in 2016.  However the right to levy the taxes is limited by the Swiss constitution, with current approval running only to the end of 2020.  Should voters reject the measure, the government would have to slash spending by more than 60 percent practically overnight or find new sources of revenue, Maurer told reporters.   \u201cThat would hardly be feasible and also not be in the interests of broad swathes of the population,\u201d he said.  The country\u2019s cantons would also suffer because they get part of the direct tax revenue, he said, noting the new law was not an excuse to raise taxation levels.  Parliament adopted the law without opposition after a debate on whether the federal government\u2019s authority to levy taxes should have a time limit. The compromise solution was to extend the deadline for both levies to 2035.   Reporting by John Revill Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"

          "body": "* Rand rallies briefly before retreating back to ranges  * Stocks flat as Steinhoff extends losses (Adds latest prices, analyst quotes)  JOHANNESBURG, Jan 9 (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s rand strengthened on Tuesday, touching its highest level in two sessions, after rumours that President Jacob Zuma had stepped down spurred a temporary rally in the currency against the greenback.  Stocks were little changed with South African-listed Steinhoff shares weighing on the market.  At 1430 GMT, the rand was up 0.28 percent to 12.3500 against the dollar from a close of 12.3800 overnight in New York.  The currency reached 12.2775, gaining around 1 percent, earlier in the session before quickly retreating to above 12.30.  \u201cThe Zuma trigger today gives a glimpse of how the rand will react if Zuma does step down early, although this possibility is increasingly being priced in,\u201d said Christopher Shiells, a senior emerging market analyst at Informa Global Markets.  On Sunday parliament said it would meet this week and review its rules relating to removing the country\u2019s president, after the constitutional court said on Dec. 29 lawmakers had previously failed to hold Zuma to account, further fuelling rumours of an early exit for the 75-year-old leader .  The ANC\u2019s top decision makers also meet this week, and Zuma\u2019s recall is expected to be on the agenda.  The rand has gained around 8 percent as investors bet Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s election as leader of the ruling African National Congress would push through business-friendly policies.  \u201cWe believe that the rand\u2019s rally is looking overstretched given that South Africa\u2019s idiosyncratic risks did not end with Ramaphosa\u2019s victory. It is for this reason that we are maintaining a cautious stance on the rand and government bonds for 2018,\u201d Shiells said.  Bonds tracked the firmer currency, with yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 down 0.5 basis points at 8.55 percent.  On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index rose 0.1 percent to 53,184 points and the All-Share index gained 0.13 percent to 60,114 points.  Steinhoff fell 13.02 percent to 7.55 rand after the European Central Bank said on Monday it had sold its bonds of the scandal-hit company, potentially suffering a loss of up to 55 percent on that investment.  Further losses came from the bullion sector, which fell 2.46 percent as a firmer dollar weighed on gold prices. .  Gold Fields fell 3.08 percent to 52.00 rand and AngloGold Ashanti was 2.34 percent lower at 128.83 rand. (Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana and Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Joe Brock)"

          "body": "* OPEC oil producer hard hit by fall in prices of crude  * Import ban imposed on 900 products to cut spending  * Ban on cell phones could upset young  * Bouteflika in power since 1999, now in poor health (Adds analyst comment, quote, background)  By Hamid Ould Ahmed  ALGIERS, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Algeria has banned the import of 900 products including cell phones, household appliances and vegetables in a bid to cut spending following a drop in earnings from oil and gas, a trade ministry document showed on Tuesday.  The temporary ban, which took effect on Sunday, is the most drastic action undertaken yet by the North African OPEC oil producer to curb a ballooning deficit caused by the fall in crude oil prices since mid-2014.  Algeria relies on oil and gas for 60 percent of the state budget but earnings from the sector have halved since oil prices collapsed hitting the state-dominated economy hard.  The restrictions will also apply to furniture, most vegetables, some meats and fruits, cheeses, chocolates, pastries, pasta, juice, bottled waters and some building materials, according to the ministry document which was seen by Reuters and whose authenticity was confirmed by an official.  \u201cThe import suspension of those products is limited in time, and will be lifted gradually with or without maintaining or increasing taxes and other duties,\u201d the document said.  The import ban - following a 30 percent rise in taxes and customs duties already imposed on some of these products from January 1 - risked upsetting Algeria\u2019s younger generation, many of whom struggle to find jobs in an economy where unemployment stands at 12 percent.  The fall in crude oil prices has put huge strain on the economy and thrown down a big challenge to the leadership around veteran President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 80, who has been in power for almost two decades. His poor health following a stroke in 2013 has prompted political manoeuvring behind the scenes.  \u201cThis kind of restrictions is bad for all consumers as it limit their choices. With the new policies, the black market will also expand, causing higher prices and hurting our purchasing power,\u201d said Ali Diji, a 30-old-year state bank employee.  With the new ban, the government hopes to bring down the import bill to $30 billion this year from a projected $45 billion for all of 2017 and $46.7 billion the previous year.  Analysts say the measure is just a temporary solution as Algeria needs to get serious about ending its dependency on oil and gas revenues, a plan for years in the works with few results to show.  \u201cIt is only with the diversification of the national economy and other reforms that the economic situation can improve,\u201d consultant and economist Brahim Guendouzi told El Watan newspaper.  Algeria has been trying to attract more investment but bureaucracy and lack of attractive laws has held back interest. Some elites in the North African country have resisted opening up the economy too much.  That situation has forced Algeria to rely heavily on imports to meet the needs of the nation\u2019s 40 million people, causing increasing spending on subsidies as authorities seek to preserve social stability.  The import ban replaces a license system, whereby importers had to apply for a licence to buy from overseas, which had shown its limitations, a senior official at the trade ministry said.  Entrepreneurs had dismissed the rules as too bureaucratic, leading to supply problems as well as higher prices for some products.  The value of Algeria\u2019s imports fell only 2.1 percent in the first 11 months of 2017 from a year earlier to $42.8 billion, according to official figures.  Oil and gas account for about 95 percent of Algeria\u2019s exports with the government having little success in boosting the non-energy sector. While the oil price has recently rebounded, it is still below $70 a barrel. Algerian officials have said it needs to be above $70 to help balance the budget.  To help cut the bill the government raised taxes and customs duties by 30 percent on some of those products from Jan.1 as part of measures aimed at securing new funding sources for the economy and reforming a subsidy system that covers almost everything.

          "body": "BERLIN, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The German federal budget had a larger-than-expected surplus of 3.7 billion euros at the end of 2017, German newspaper Handelsblatt said on Tuesday, adding those funds were due to be put aside for asylum seekers for a future government to use.  Handelsblatt did not cite its source for the information.  It said an additional 6.7 billion euros from a reserve for asylum seekers had, contrary to plans, not been used so that money was also available for use in coming years. That means the government has 10.4 billion euros more to spend than planned.  The German Finance Ministry declined to comment on the figures but said it is due to give details of its 2017 finances on Friday.

          "body": "OSLO (Reuters) - The ethics watchdog for Norway\u2019s $1 trillion wealth fund will this year identify companies that violate workers\u2019 rights when hiring people for jobs in the Middle East, and recommend excluding them from the fund\u2019s portfolio.  Companies in the global shipping industry will also face scrutiny and risk being blacklisted if their recycling of obsolete vessels fails to meet certain standards, Johan Andresen, chairman of fund\u2019s ethics panel told Reuters on Tuesday.

          "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German industrial workers widened industrial action on Tuesday, with nearly 60,000 staff at 280 metals and engineering companies downing their tools in support of wage claims by union IG Metall.  With the economy in robust health and unemployment at record lows, the country\u2019s biggest union is demanding an inflation-busting 6 percent pay hike this year for about 3.9 million workers.   It is also making a push for shorter hours, more than two decades after it won the 35-hour work week for Germans.  Ahead of a round of regional negotiations due to begin on Thursday, employers have so far offered 2 percent plus a one-off 200 euro ($240) payment in the first quarter and rejected demands for shorter hours.  In the state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone, the industrial heartland of Germany, workers at 140 companies including Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) staged walkouts and marched outside factory gates carrying banners.  In other parts of the country, companies including engineering group Siemens (SIEGn.DE), carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE), automotive suppliers Schaeffler (SHA_p.DE) and farm equipment maker John Deere (DE.N) were affected.  Since the start of last week, a total of around 80,000 workers have taken action across the nation, including Tuesday\u2019s walkouts, the union said. IG Metall has announced further walkouts for Wednesday.  Such industrial action is common in Germany before sector-wide pay negotiations, and similar walkouts took place in 2016 and 2015.  The union has made it clear it is drawing a line in the sand regarding shorter working hours and has threatened to move beyond walkouts lasting only a few hours to all-out strikes across the sector.  The union has called for higher wages as well as a right to reduce weekly hours to 28 from 35 and return to full-time employment after two years for shift workers and those who need to care for children or elderly relatives.  Employers have so far rejected the demand because it includes a provision under which companies would help make up for the pay shortfall for some workers who shorten their hours.  Talks between unions and employers\u2019 associations are set for Thursday in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Volkswagen\u2019s (VOWG_p.DE) Porsche, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and automotive suppliers including Bosch [ROBG.UL] are based.  \u201cIf we do not see any willingness to even discuss the topic seriously on Thursday, the situation will escalate further,\u201d Roman Zitzelsberger, head of IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg, told German daily Handelsblatt.  Next door in Bavaria negotiations will resume on Jan. 15, and to the north in North Rhine-Westphalia on Jan. 18.  The labor dispute follows a strong year of growth in Europe\u2019s largest economy, driven by domestic demand from record numbers of German workers while borrowing costs and inflation remain low and exporters benefit from a global recovery.  That pattern should extend through 2018, with the Ifo economic institute last month forecasting growth of 2.6 percent for the year.

          "body": "CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian court jailed 262 people from three years to life on Tuesday for security-related offences during a 2013 sit-in protest against the ousting of former president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, judicial sources said.  They were charged with causing the deaths of two policemen during clashes at al-Nahda square in Giza in southern Cairo, as well as other counts of attempted murder and vandalism.  Seventeen people were sentenced to life in prison, 223 were given 15 years and another 22 accused were given three years.  The court acquitted 115 others accused in the case.  Al-Nahda square was one of two sites where Mursi supporters gathered in the weeks following his overthrow by the military in July 2013 led by then general and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Sisi was elected in 2014 and is expected to seek a second term in a March vote this year.  Authorities broke up the two sit-ins - at al-Nahda and Rabaa squares - in August 2013, killing hundreds of protesters. Protests were banned shortly after the two pro-Mursi camps were dispersed and scores were arrested.   Hundreds of Mursi sympathizers have been detained and prosecuted since his ousting. Egypt has banned the Muslim Brotherhood, deeming it a terrorist organization.  The government accuses the Brotherhood of fomenting an Islamist insurgency since Mursi\u2019s removal. Militant attacks have killed hundreds of Egyptians, mostly soldiers and police.  Security forces have killed hundreds and detained thousands of members of the group, which says it is committed to political change through peaceful means only.  The court also ordered on Tuesday that those sentenced be fined a total of nearly 40 million Egyptian pounds ($2.27 million) for damaging public property.

A 1.7 percent rise in Johnson & Johnson and a 5 percent jump in Boston Scientific helped the S&P health sector gain 0.7 percent.

          "body": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer on Tuesday pleaded with voters on Tuesday to let the federal government keep levying taxes when they decide on a new public finance law in March.  Under Switzerland\u2019s system of direct democracy, voters on March 4 will have their say on extending the federal government\u2019s right to levy federal income tax and value-added tax.  The direct federal tax and the sales tax together contributed about two-thirds of the Swiss central government\u2019s budget, bringing in around 43.5 billion Swiss francs ($44.25 billion) in 2016.  However the right to levy the taxes is limited by the Swiss constitution, with current approval running only to the end of 2020.  Should voters reject the measure, the government would have to slash spending by more than 60 percent practically overnight or find new sources of revenue, Maurer told reporters.   \u201cThat would hardly be feasible and also not be in the interests of broad swathes of the population,\u201d he said.  The country\u2019s cantons would also suffer because they get part of the direct tax revenue, he said, noting the new law was not an excuse to raise taxation levels.  Parliament adopted the law without opposition after a debate on whether the federal government\u2019s authority to levy taxes should have a time limit. The compromise solution was to extend the deadline for both levies to 2035.   Reporting by John Revill Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"

          "body": "ZURICH, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Switzerland\u2019s retail sector is expected to partially recover in 2018 due to a buoyant Swiss economy, which has largely overcome problems triggered by a strong franc following the scrapping in 2015 of a central bank cap against the euro.  Swiss shoppers who flocked to neighbouring Germany, France and Italy to pick up bargains are expected to spend more money at home and sales by the country\u2019s retailers are forecast to rise by 0.3 percent this year, Credit Suisse said on Tuesday.  The improvement would follow a 0.1 percent increase in 2017, the first rise in three years, the bank said.  Although Switzerland\u2019s retail market is relatively small at around 90 billion Swiss francs ($92 billion) per year, it is an important market for luxury brands in particular.  The outlook comes as official data on Tuesday showed retail sales rose by 0.2 percent in November compared with a year earlier, although when inflation was taken into account there was a 0.2 percent decline.  \u201cThere is a recovery for the retail sector as a whole, although it is lagging the entire Swiss economy,\u201d said Sascha Jucker, a Credit Suisse economist.  \u201cOverall you can talk about a stabilisation, the start of a recovery, although not every retailer will agree with you. There are still some problematic areas like clothing and personal care which are not benefiting to the same extent as food retailers.\u201d  Shop managers interviewed by consultancy Fuhrer & Holz are also slightly more optimistic, with 60 percent expecting rising sales in 2018.  Swiss supermarket Coop - one of the two chains which dominate the country - last week reported net sales of 17.4 billion francs for 2017 in its retail business, up from 17.2 billion francs a year earlier.  When the Swiss National Bank scrapped the long-standing cap it sent the franc rocketing and left Swiss shops saddled with products costing 50 percent more than just across the border.  But last year\u2019s near 9 percent depreciation of the franc versus the euro, coupled with higher inflation outside Switzerland, has led to a comparative price reduction.  Shopping tourism from Switzerland was estimated to have levelled out or even slightly declined in 2017, from 11 billion francs in 2016, Credit Suisse said.  But retail growth still lags the overall Swiss economy, which Credit Suisse expects to grow by 1.7 percent this year, largely because of ecommerce, with more Swiss shoppers using services like Zalando and Amazon  Online retailers have around 7 percent of the Swiss market, a figure Credit Suisse expects to rise to 11 percent by 2022.  \u201cThe biggest challenge will come from online retailers as they expand their offering in Switzerland,\u201d Jucker said.

          "body": "* China postpones signature of firm contract for fuel plant  * French minister says assured of signature in spring  * Project price remains a sticking point (Adds finance minister comments)  By Michel Rose  BEIJING, Jan 9 (Reuters) - France\u2019s Areva signed a protocol agreement on Tuesday to build a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility in China worth 10 billion euros ($12 billion), but has yet to secure a firm contract for a deal seen as vital to reviving the French nuclear industry.  The French nuclear industry has struggled to secure new business since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident stunted orders worldwide. It has also suffered from growing competition from renewable energy and cheap natural gas.  Areva, which was bailed out by the state in 2017 after years of losses wiped out its equity, has signed several partnership and other initial agreements with China for the reprocessing plant, but has failed to turn those deals into a firm contract.  On a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) repeated its commitment to building the reprocessing plant. But officials said the price for transferring technology remained a sticking point.  \u201cWe have the assurance of a contract (for the reprocessing plant) with a deadline and a signature in the spring, and this will save the industry. It is worth 10 billion euros,\u201d French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters in Beijing.  \u201cThe talks with the Chinese are extraordinarily difficult because their strategy is not to imitate the technology but to improve it,\u201d he said, adding that France had \u201cmade an effort\u201d on the price to try to unblock the talks.  Areva CEO Philippe Knoche said reaching a firm deal was getting closer. \u201cI am looking to finalising the talks and start-up of the project in 2018,\u201d he said in a statement.  The initial target had been to commission the plant by 2030, meaning work would have to start by around 2020 latest.  Talks on technical aspects of the project were completed in June 2015. Since then, several agreements have been signed, typically during high-level government visits, but no firm contract.  Reprocessing uranium involves extracting plutonium from spent nuclear fuel to reuse in a new cycle, but the process is costly and dangerous. Most countries, such as the United States, Britain and Japan, have given up on it or are phasing it out.  The Chinese plant would be modeled on Areva\u2019s facilities at La Hague in western France but with a lower capacity. The Chinese plant would be able to reprocess 800 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel a year, compared La Hague\u2019s 2,700 tonnes.  China also wants to build a Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel plant modelled on Areva\u2019s plant in Melox, southern France. La Hague takes plutonium out of uranium burned in French nuclear plants, which Melox blends with uranium to produce new MOX fuel rods.  $1 = 0.8384 euros\nAdditional reporting by Benjamin Mallet in Paris; Writing by\nGeert De Clercq; Editing by Richard Lough and Edmund Blair"

          "body": "* North says nuclear weapons aimed only at the U.S.  * Makes \u201cstrong complaint\u201d after denuclearisation is raised  * North to send a large delegation to Winter Olympics  * Graphic on the talks: tmsnrt.rs/2t8i6no  * Multimedia package: www.reuters.com/north-korea/ (Adds quotes from North's negotiator, South's statement)  By Christine Kim and Hyonhee Shin  SEOUL, Jan 9 (Reuters) - North Korea said on Tuesday it would not discuss its nuclear weapons in coming talks with Seoul because they were aimed only at the United States, not its \u201cbrethren\u201d in South Korea.  Officials from North and South said they agreed on Tuesday to hold negotiations to resolve problems and avert accidental conflict, after their first official dialogue in more than two years amid high tension over the North\u2019s weapons programme.  The U.N. Security Council last month unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea in response to its test-firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Pyongyang called them an act of war.  In a joint statement after 11 hours of talks, the North pledged to send a large delegation to next month\u2019s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the South, but made a \u201cstrong complaint\u201d after Seoul proposed talks to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.  \u201cAll our weapons including atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs and ballistic missiles are only aimed at the United States, not our brethren, nor China and Russia,\u201d said Pyongyang\u2019s chief negotiator Ri Son Gwon.  \u201cThis is not a matter between North and South Korea, and to bring up this issue would cause negative consequences and risks turning all of today\u2019s good achievement into nothing,\u201d Ri, chairman of the North\u2019s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, warned in closing remarks.  Seoul believes improved inter-Korean ties and a series of steps agreed on Tuesday could pave the way for discussion of a \u201cfundamental resolution\u201d of the nuclear issue in the future, the South\u2019s unification ministry said in a separate statement.  \u201cWe will closely coordinate with the United States, China, Japan and other neighbours in this process,\u201d it said.  South Korea had asked the North to halt hostile acts that stoke tension on the peninsula, and the North agreed that peace should be guaranteed in the region, the ministry said.  Earlier on Tuesday, Seoul said it was prepared to lift some sanctions temporarily so North Koreans could visit the South for the Winter Olympics. The North said its delegation would include athletes, high-ranking officials, a cheering squad, art performers, reporters and spectators.  South Korea has unilaterally banned several North Korean officials from entry in response to Pyongyang\u2019s missile and nuclear tests.  Talks will be held soon to work out the details of bringing the North Koreans to the Olympics, the unification ministry said.  The North-South meeting comes after a year of ramped-up North Korean missile launches, its sixth and most powerful nuclear test and exchanges of threats and insults between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump.  It was held in the three-storey Peace House on the South Korean side of Panmunjom truce village which lies between North and South.  \u201cWe came to this meeting with the thought of giving our brethren, who have high hopes for this dialogue, invaluable results as the first present of the year,\u201d Ri said at the start of the meeting.  Seoul said it proposed reunions of members of families divided between North and South in time for February\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday, but the joint statement made no mention of any agreement on reunions.  The North has finished technical work to restore a military hotline with South Korea, Seoul said, with normal communications set to resume on Wednesday.  The North cut communications in February 2016, following the South\u2019s decision to shut down a jointly run industrial park in the North.  North Korea responded \u201cpositively\u201d to the South\u2019s proposal for athletes from both sides to march together in the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, Seoul said.  Athletes of the two sides have not paraded together at an international sports event since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China.  The United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War, initially responded coolly to the idea of inter-Korean meetings, but U.S. President Donald Trump later called them \u201ca good thing\u201d.  \u201cAt the appropriate time, we\u2019ll get involved,\u201d he said.  On Tuesday, China\u2019s foreign ministry said it was happy to see talks between North and South Korea and welcomed all positive steps. Russia echoed the sentiment, with a Kremlin spokesman saying: \u201cThis is exactly the kind of dialogue that we said was necessary.\u201d  International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said of the North-South agreement on the Pyeongchang games: \u201cThese proposals mark a great step forward in the Olympic spirit.\u201d  The IOC would await official proposals on the number and names of athletes from the North and such matters as flag, anthem and ceremonies, he added.

          "body": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) agreed on Tuesday to make a renewed effort to settle a dispute over the latter\u2019s name which has been dragging on for decades and holding up its aspirations of joining the EU.  Athens has blocked the ex-Yugoslav republic\u2019s attempts to join NATO and objects to its EU membership bid because it says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over Greece\u2019s own northerly region of that name.  \u201cWe are committed to finding a solution in this six months,\u201d said Bujar Osmani, FYROM\u2019s deputy prime minister responsible for European affairs. \u201c2018 is the golden year of opportunity for my country to make progress in terms of Euro-atlantic integration. That is why we are committed to finding a solution.\u201d   Under a 1995 accord, Greece has only agreed that the country be referred to as the \u201cFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, as an interim measure until the dispute is resolved.   It will not acquiesce to the country joining NATO or the EU, of which Greece is a member, under the FYROM banner.  Osmani, who was visiting Athens, said he believed there was a \u201csincerity and commitment\u201d\u2018 by Greece to resolve the issue.    Greeks are very sensitive about the name issue, and rallies were planned in northern Greece later in January against any compromise which may use the name Macedonia.  But Athens says there is now a window of opportunity to resolve the row following the election of a more moderate government in the neighboring country which appears more amenable to a deal.  \u201cRight now the issue...is to create conditions for the widest possible consensus to put behind us a problem which has weighed on the country, and the wider region, for the past twenty five years,\u201d Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said.  Greece and FYROM were due to hold a new round of talks with a United Nations mediator in late January.   The Balkan state declared independence from ex-Yugoslavia in 1991 but almost immediately found itself at loggerheads with Greece.   \u201cThere are a lot of emotional layers. We need to peel them off to find a rational solution,\u201d Osmani told reporters after meeting Greek officials.  Reporting by Renee Maltezou, writing by Michele Kambas; Editing by Angus MacSwan"

Dimon, known for his candid comments, slammed the viability of bitcoin in September. \u201cThe currency isn\u2019t going to work. You can\u2019t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,\u201d he had said at a conference.  The buzz generated by Dimon\u2019s comments spurred more interest in the alt-currency. Bitcoin rose around 30 percent in one month following Dimon\u2019s speech, where he also compared the currency to tulips bulbs in a reference to the famous market bubble from the 1600s.  Dimon's comments were followed by a more tempered view from Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who said the bank was \"very open minded to the potential use cases in future for digital currencies that are properly controlled and regulated.\" (reut.rs/2mies8H)  Despite Dimon\u2019s criticism, several banks, exchange operators and companies eagerly embraced bitcoin, sparking a spectacular rise in the ctyptocurrency.  On Tuesday, bitcoin BTC=BTSP was down nearly 5 percent at $14,202 in early trading. It traded at $909 a year ago and breached $19,000 in December.  Exchange operators such as CME Group Inc (CME.O) and Cboe Global Markets Inc (CBOE.O) opened their platforms to allow bitcoin futures trading, while Square Inc (SQ.N) rolled out a bitcoin buying/selling feature on its app to a select few. (reut.rs/2AHz1Q1) (reut.rs/2AK55Tq)  Dimon and Lake, however, have commended blockchain - the technology used by bitcoin and other digital currencies - a view echoed by Citigroup Inc (C.N) CFO John Gerspach and many others across the industry.  \"Blockchain is real.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Germany\u2019s biggest trade union and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi share a common cause. The former wants a big pay rise for industrial workers in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The latter wants euro zone wage growth to pick up so that he can stop worrying about inflation being too low. Teutonic workers have a strong hand but may still disappoint Draghi.   IG Metall is asking for a 6 percent pay rise that will affect nearly 4 million German industrial workers, some of whom went on strike on Monday and Tuesday. The union typically secures about half of what it asks for, according to JPMorgan analysis, but might have expected to do better this year, given a booming economy. The national unemployment rate is 3.6 percent, the lowest on record. More than a fifth of manufacturing firms say output is being hampered by labour shortages, according to the Bundesbank\u2019s December monthly report.   But higher pay is not the only thing IG Metall wants. The union is demanding more working time flexibility and wants employees to be able to cut their hours by a fifth, to 28, for two years while retaining a right to return to full-time work. It also wants shift workers or those caring for older people or children to receive some compensation if they choose reduced hours. Employers have so far rejected these demands. They may only countenance any flexibility if the union cedes more ground on wages. That\u2019s unhelpful for the ECB, which has been buying bonds and slashed its deposit rate below zero to get inflation back to its near-2 percent goal, from 1.4 percent in December.  German workers may not be much more helpful in future. They already work the least number of hours a year of any in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, and 12 percent fewer hours than they did in 1991, the year after reunification. Further reductions in working time, a shortage of skilled labour and even modest rises in wages may force German industrial companies to move more jobs overseas. That would erode workers\u2019 bargaining power \u2013 and their ability to help the ECB to generate inflation.

          "body": "COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark\u2019s center-right coalition government will scale back its tax-cut plan to get it through parliament rather than link it to legislation on revoking refugees\u2019 residence rights, as sought by its nationalist ally the Danish People\u2019s Party (DF).  The move is another reminder of the minority government\u2019s difficulties in pushing through its economic agenda in a parliament dominated by parties, including DF, that support the welfare state and its high taxes.  In return for the proposed tax cuts, DF had demanded new legislation that would make it easier to revoke residence permits for refugees from nations such as Syria once peace is restored in their home countries.  But Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said at a press conference on Tuesday that he saw no reason why the two subjects should be linked.  \u201cThe government would very much like to discuss immigration policy with DF. But it should be on the immigration policy\u2019s own terms ... not to get tax cuts,\u201d he said.  Rasmussen, who heads the Liberal Party, said he would therefore only continue tax negotiations in areas where DF and the government have already agreed to proceed.  He said he hoped to be able to \u201crather quickly\u201d reach a deal on the tax policy for the next four years but not for the years through to 2025 as he had first intended.  \u201cI bet there will be other opportunities before we get there, so it\u2019s not that the government is giving up on its ambitions,\u201d Rasmussen said.  His junior coalition partner Liberal Alliance (LA) had said before Christmas that the coming tax cuts would be \u201chistorically big\u201d.  The anti-immigration DF is not part of the three-way coalition, but the government depends on it for a majority in parliament.  DF leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl said Rasmussen\u2019s decision on Tuesday made it possible for the parties to move on despite the rather \u201clocked\u201d political situation in parliament.   Dahl said DF would continue to work for its tighter immigration proposals regarding war refugees.  Reporting by Teis Jensen and Erik Matzen; Editing by Hugh Lawson"

          "body": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Israel should stop plans to send tens of thousands of migrants back to Africa forcibly, the United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday, suggesting some could be resettled in Europe or other countries.    Israel said last Wednesday it would pay thousands of African migrants living illegally in the country to leave, threatening them with jail if they are caught after the end of March.  The vast majority come from Eritrea and Sudan and many say they fled war and persecution as well as economic hardship. Israel treats them mostly as economic migrants.  The plan offers African migrants a $3,500 payment from the Israeli government and a free air ticket to return home or go to \u201cthird countries\u201d, which rights groups identified as Rwanda and Uganda.  \u201cWe are again appealing to Israel to halt its policy of relocating Eritreans and Sudanese to sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d William Spindler of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told a Geneva briefing.  \u201cOfficial statements that the plans may eventually target families and those with pending asylum claims, or that asylum seekers might be taken to the airport in handcuffs, are particularly alarming,\u201d he said.  Some 27,000 Eritreans and 7,700 Sudanese live in Israel, but authorities there have only granted refugee status to 11 since 2009, Spindler said.  In Europe, Eritreans have a very high rate of recognition as refugees fleeing war or persecution, he said. \u201cSo we would expect that among them, many would qualify for refugee status.  \u201cWhat we would like to see in Israel \u2013 and we are willing to help in that respect \u2013 is to find legal alternatives for these people, through resettlement in other countries.\u201d   Rwanda and Uganda both said last Friday they had not struck any deal to take in African migrants from Israel under a scheme condemned by rights groups.  Over the past two years, UNHCR has interviewed 80 Eritrean refugees or asylum seekers in Rome who arrived in Italy after a hazardous journey across Africa following their departure from Israel to Rwanda, Spindler said.  \u201cAlong the way, they suffered abuse, torture and extortion before risking their lives once again by crossing the Mediterranean to Italy,\u201d he said.   Some migrants had reportedly died en route to Libya, he said, noting that U.N. agencies are carrying out emergency evacuations of migrants from Libya, where slave-like conditions have been reported in detention centers.

Bitcoin rose around 30 percent in one month following Dimon\u2019s speech, where he also compared the currency to tulips bulbs in a reference to the famous market bubble from the 1600s.  Dimon's comments were followed by a more tempered view from Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who said the bank was \"very open minded to the potential use cases in future for digital currencies that are properly controlled and regulated.\" (reut.rs/2mies8H)  Despite Dimon\u2019s criticism, several banks, exchange operators and companies eagerly embraced bitcoin, sparking a spectacular rise in the ctyptocurrency.  On Tuesday, bitcoin was down nearly 5 percent at $14,202 in early trading. It traded at $909 a year ago and breached $19,000 in December.  Exchange operators such as CME Group Inc and Cboe Global Markets Inc opened their platforms to allow bitcoin futures trading, while Square Inc rolled out a bitcoin buying/selling feature on its app to a select few. (reut.rs/2AHz1Q1) (reut.rs/2AK55Tq)  Dimon and Lake, however, have commended blockchain - the technology used by bitcoin and other digital currencies - a view echoed by Citigroup Inc CFO John Gerspach and many others across the industry.  \"Blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that,\" Dimon told Fox. (fxn.ws/2AI9LcA)  Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty"

          "body": "* Chinese funds lead equity league tables  * Russia equity funds biggest losers of 2017  * Vontobel tops EM debt funds with contrarian stance  * TABLE-Leaders and laggards in 2017:  By Claire Milhench  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Chinese equity funds trounced their emerging market peers in 2017, buoyed by MSCI\u2019s decision to include mainland shares in some of its indexes, while Latin American names helped the top debt performers, data from Lipper showed.  And although managers say it will be hard to repeat the scale of last year\u2019s success, most are optimistic, seeing only gradual U.S. interest rate rises and continued support from fund inflows in 2018.  Chinese funds filled the top 12 places in a league table of emerging equity funds, according to performance data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. They squeezed out Indian rivals which had kept them company in the first half of 2017.  On average, emerging equity funds returned 29.2 percent, according to Lipper, more than double 2016\u2019s 13 percent. But that lagged MSCI\u2019s benchmark emerging stocks index, which gained more than 34 percent last year.  The steady climb attracted strong inflows, with emerging equity funds pulling in $83.8 billion, according to EPFR Global data, up from $435 million in 2016.  Chinese mainland stocks gained almost 22 percent in 2017, as MSCI\u2019s decision to include so-called A-shares in its equity indexes lit a fire under the market. Hong Kong-listed shares, many of which are already included in the MSCI China index, rose 36 percent in 2017.  Greg Kuhnert, manager of the Investec GSF All China Equity fund, which topped the equity table with a return of over 70 percent, said MSCI inclusion meant China was becoming increasingly important in asset allocation decisions.  \u201cIn this environment, we believe the recent market pull-back offers attractive entry points,\u201d he said, highlighting opportunities in financials like Ping An and consumer names such as dairy company Inner Mongolia Yili .  William Yuen, co-manager of the Invesco PRC Equity Fund , which came fourth with 61 percent gains, was also bullish on the consumer and services sectors. But he expects the first half of 2018 to be \u201ca little more challenging\u201d due to slower industrial activity and regulatory uncertainties.  Russian equity funds, which had topped the table in 2016, brought up the rear in 2017 after the United States opted not to lift economic sanctions as expected. Russian equities ended the year down more than 5 percent.  Emerging debt funds also benefited from strong inflows in 2017, attracting a record $80.3 billion according to EPFR Global, well above $37.6 billion the year before.  The top-performing sector fund according to Lipper was Vontobel Asset Management\u2019s hard currency Emerging Markets Debt fund with 16.3 percent returns, versus the average 9 percent gain at emerging debt funds tracked by Lipper.  \u201cWe cannot repeat this every year but in general we are still positive on the market,\u201d Wouter Van Overfelt, senior portfolio manager said, noting attractive average spreads of around 280 basis points over Treasuries.  He partly attributed his fund\u2019s success to local currency holdings in Mexico, Argentina and Indonesia, which outperformed their dollar equivalents. The Mexico overweight also helped, as fears about harsh U.S. policies in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election to the presidency proved overdone.  Gradual Federal Reserve tightening and robust global growth should be positive for emerging markets, he predicted. But he also said: \u201cGiven that spreads have tightened quite a bit, we have increased the quality in our portfolio, by reducing our exposure to Africa, for example.\u201d  Ashmore\u2019s Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond fund came second with 15.8 percent returns, also thanks to big holdings in Mexico, Brazil and South Africa.  Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore, said upcoming elections in Brazil and Mexico could provide opportunities this year, although Mexico is no longer an overweight.  \u201cIf (left-wing Mexican presidential candidate) Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador looks like he will win, the peso will take a huge hit, but if he gets into office he won\u2019t be half as bad as the market will price in,\u201d Dehn said.  Like Overfelt, Dehn took a phlegmatic view of Fed moves.  \u201cThe start of the Fed hiking signal has actually been the signal for the rally in local markets as they priced in far more hikes than we\u2019re going to get any time soon,\u201d he said.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron offered on Tuesday to open up the French economy to Chinese investment in exchange for greater access to China\u2019s booming markets, warning in talks in Beijing that existing trade imbalances would lead to protectionism.  On the first state visit of his eight-month-old presidency, Macron is hoping greater openness from China, coupled with lobbying from the 50-strong business delegation traveling with him, will help narrow the 30-billion-euro ($36 bln) trade deficit Paris runs with Beijing.  But despite bringing with him a delegation of French business, finance and industry - including senior executives from Airbus, BNP Paribas, AccorHotels, EDF and LVMH - there were no immediate announcements on the second leg of his three-day trip of major deals. Instead, smaller contracts or commitments to go on talking were signed.  BNP Paribas was set to announce plans for a joint-venture on consumer credit, a French official in Beijing said, adding that French nuclear group Areva had \u201cnever been so close\u201d to signing a contract to build a nuclear waste reprocessing plant in China.  \u201cWe have an access to markets which is unbalanced, unsatisfying,\u201d Macron told members of the French and Chinese business community at a start-up incubator in Beijing.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with this responsibly, the first, natural, reaction will be to close up on both sides.\u201d  In his short time in office, 40-year-old Macron has managed to push through reforms to France\u2019s labor market and seen a steady rise in business and consumer confidence. Growth forecasts for 2018 have been upgraded.  Macron has emerged as arguably the strongest voice in Europe, in the absence of either German and British leadership, with Chancellor Angela Merkel bogged down in coalition negotiations and Prime Minister Theresa May swamped by Brexit.  Soon after arriving in China, the French president declared that \u201cEurope is back\u201d, announcing he intended to visit China every year of his five-year presidency.  But while the rhetoric has been strong, and TV commentary suggests Macron and his glamorous 64-year-old wife Brigitte have been a big hit with the Chinese, the underlying success of state visits is often measured in the size of business contracts.  Planemaker Airbus was in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China, officials familiar with the talks said last week.  But after an official contract signing ceremony on Tuesday, it appeared that an Airbus deal had not been clinched. That would be a significant setback for Macron and Europe, although it is possible details will be finalised in the weeks ahead.  U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to China last year  coincided with an announcement by Boeing Co that it had sold 300 aircraft to China.  Without a big dollar figure attached to the visit, Macron appeared to have fallen short, although French officials said China had asked them not to put a figure on any commercial and industrial deals they did strike.  Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of online retailer Alibaba, gave Macron\u2019s pitch for more openness his backing on Tuesday, but added both sides had a part to play.  \u201cI think he\u2019s right, China should open more, China is opening more,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of a business forum in Beijing.  \u201cFrance should open more, China should open more,\u201d he added.  Foreign businesses in China though have grown more pessimistic about Beijing\u2019s market restrictions even though government officials have repeatedly pledged to increase access. These businesses have also chafed at government policies they see as intended to assimilate and supplant foreign technology.  \u201cWe welcome France to expand investment in China and exports of high-grade French products, and we hope the French side will further loosen exports of high-tech products to China,\u201d China\u2019s Premier Li Keqiang told Macron, according to a Chinese government statement.  Macron, who met President Xi Jinping on Monday, said the two countries would fall into a lose-lose situation if continued restrictions on foreign firms in China prompted France and Europe to put a brake on Chinese investment in Europe.  \u201cLet\u2019s open up both instead,\u201d said Macron, whose government has at the same time called for greater scrutiny of Chinese investment in Europe, particularly in sensitive sectors, concerned about protecting French interests and security.  The two presidents met again on Tuesday at Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People, and oversaw the signing of bilateral agreements, including the framework deals for Airbus and Areva in China.  Chinese online retail giant JD.com agreed to sell 2 billion euros worth of French products - such as Remy Martin cognac or Evian water - on its website over the next two years. JD.com also signed a deal to buy 100 million euros of machinery from French engineering firm Fives.

          "body": "KIEV (Reuters) - A Dutch court has issued a provisional order to freeze the Netherlands-based companies of the flagship business group owned by Ukraine\u2019s richest man in connection with a long-running $820 million lawsuit.  Systems Capital Management (SCM) is owned by Rinat Akhmetov, who has amassed a multi-billion dollar fortune through his conglomerate\u2019s industrial and financial holdings, and owns Ukrainian soccer club FC Shakhtar Donetsk.   In December, a Cypriot court issued a provisional worldwide asset freezing order against Akhmetov and various SCM companies - part of a legal dispute with Cyprus-based firm Raga, which says SCM has not paid it in full for the 2013 sale of telecoms group Ukrtelecom.  A Dutch court has now issued a provisional ruling to freeze  SCM\u2019s Netherlands-registered businesses, which include Ukraine\u2019s largest steel company Metinvest [METIV.UL] and largest private power and coal producer, DTEK [DTEKF.UL].   Raga\u2019s representative sent Reuters a copy of the ruling on Monday. The decisions are not publicly available, but Reuters requested a copy of the ruling from the court on Tuesday.  SCM said on Tuesday it was not aware of the Dutch court decision.   \u201cAs far as the work of the SCM group\u2019s assets is concerned, they continue to work as usual,\u201d it said in an emailed statement  SCM has said it will appeal the Cypriot court\u2019s ruling. The next hearing is on Feb. 27, according to Raga\u2019s representative.  \u201cThe entities of SCM group will also vigorously defend themselves against baseless claims by Raga Establishment Limited that gave rise to issuance of the interim order,\u201d SCM said on Friday.  Raga says SCM has failed to pay an $820 million debt due as a result of arbitration rulings in Raga\u2019s favor in 2017.  The latest court orders against Akhmetov and SCM follow a UK court\u2019s December decision to freeze the worldwide assets of Ukraine\u2019s second- and third-richest men, Ihor Kolomoisky and Gennadiy Bogolyubov, in an unrelated case.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is expected to choose a new central bank chief this year to succeed Canadian Mark Carney, who will step down in June 2019, three months after the country\u2019s scheduled exit from the European Union.  Following is a summary of possible contenders to run the Bank of England (BoE), which oversees the world\u2019s sixth-biggest economy and Britain\u2019s huge finance industry. No one has yet thrown their hat into the ring.  ANDREW BAILEY - the outsider insider  Widely tipped by analysts as Carney\u2019s most likely successor, Bailey reached the role of deputy governor of the BoE with a focus on banks before becoming chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, a financial markets regulator.  During his time at the BoE, Bailey helped to steer Britain\u2019s banks through the global financial crisis, enhancing his reputation as a safe pair of hands.  However, heading the FCA - which roots out misconduct in Britain\u2019s large financial services sector - is fraught with risks. The head of the British parliament\u2019s influential Treasury Committee has criticised Bailey for withholding parts of a report into alleged misconduct by state-owned RBS during the financial crisis. Bailey has cited privacy restrictions.  As FCA boss, Bailey sits on important panels at the BoE that oversee banks. Although he has never been interest-rate setter, he once ran the BoE international economic analysis team.  Bailey acknowledged the speculation about a move to the BoE in an interview published this week. \u201cYou\u2019ll be unsurprised to know this question comes up reasonably often,\u201d Bailey told Financial News. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a job and, I have to be honest with you, I have never spent my time thinking about the one I want to do next.\u201d      BEN BROADBENT AND DAVE RAMSDEN - the deputies   Broadbent and Ramsden are deputy governors for monetary policy and for markets and banking respectively, burnishing their credentials as potential successors to Carney.   Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist who once trained as a classical pianist, is respected for his economic analysis but has less experience on banking oversight, which has become an important part of the BoE governor\u2019s role.  Ramsden only joined the central bank in September although he is no stranger to the Monetary Policy Committee having attended 92 of its meetings in his previous role as the Treasury\u2019s chief economic advisor.  The two other BoE deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods, are less likely contenders. Woods focuses mostly on bank regulation while Cunliffe - a former British ambassador to the EU - would be aged 66 at the start of the term which usually runs for eight years, although Carney has chosen to step down after six.  ANDY HALDANE - the free thinker  The BoE\u2019s chief economist, Haldane has developed a reputation for floating unconventional ideas, including the abolition of cash as a way to give central banks more muscle over the economies they run. In 2012, he praised the anti-capitalist Occupy movement for suggesting new ways to fix the shortcomings of global finance. Haldane has experience of both sides of the Bank, having served previously as executive director for financial stability, overseeing the risks to the economy from the banking system. But he might be seen as too much of a maverick to take the job of governor.  The announcement of Carney, the first non-British governor of the BoE in more than three centuries, was a surprise. Should finance minister Philip Hammond also opt for a less obvious candidate, one name that has appeared in Britain\u2019s media is that of Sharon White, the head of a telecoms regulator and who previously worked at the Treasury. The daughter of Jamaican immigrants, she has won wide praise for her high-profile roles in the public sector. Another outside contender would be Adair Turner, a former chairman of a now defunct financial services regulator who was in the running last time around. He continues to speak about the British economy and has warned of the risks from high debt levels.      The prospect of the left-wing Labour Party taking power in the next year or so is remote but investors are mindful that Prime Minister Theresa May has only a small majority in parliament after last year\u2019s failed election gamble and her Conservative Party is split over how to leave the European Union. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his would-be finance minister John McDonnell are socialists and have in the past proposed that the BoE should fund investment in infrastructure, a big change from its current focus on inflation. If they were to pick the next BoE governor, Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment strategist at Tilney Group, an investment firm, said they might consider former members of an economic advisory committee which included U.S. academic and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and Ann Pettifor, a British economist who is an austerity critic.

          "body": "LJUBLJANA, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Slovenia plans to reduce its public debt to a little more than 70 percent of gross domestic product this year, the Ministry of Finance told Reuters on Tuesday.  The government wants to cut debt to 32.5 billion euros ($38.78 billion), or 71.7 percent of GDP. Last year, debt fell to 75.2 percent of GDP from 78.5 percent in 2016, according to the October finance ministry estimate.  Slovenia\u2019s economy returned to growth in 2014 after avoiding an international bailout of its banks. Its goal is to reduce debt by 2030 to 60 percent of GDP, the ceiling set by the European Union.  The finance ministry also rejected local media reports that the government is considering raising value-added tax to 24 percent from 22 percent to cover demands for higher public-sector wages.  \u201cWe are not preparing any such decrees. The finance ministry would not support an increase of VAT to cover trade unions\u2019 demands,\u201d the ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters.  A number of public-sector unions are threatening strikes later in January or in February unless their wages are increased significantly, among them teachers\u2019 trade union SVIZ.  The government, which is preparing for a parliamentary election that is expected in June, is in talks with unions regarding wage hikes but has said wage increases have to remain limited.

          "body": "BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia criticized Austrian plans to cut benefit payments for children living abroad on Tuesday, saying the step may discriminate against Slovaks working in Austria.   Austria\u2019s ruling coalition of conservatives and the far right last week unveiled plans to cut the benefits, which start at around 114 euros ($136) a month for a child.  Austria borders eight countries, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, where wages are significantly lower.   Eastern Europeans make up a large part of its workforce in sectors including healthcare and construction but they often live and work away from their families and children.      Speaking at a news conference in Bratislava after a meeting Austria\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister Karin Kneissl, Slovakia\u2019s acting Foreign Minister Ivan Korcok called on Austria to honor the principle of non-discrimination.  \u201cOur citizens who work in Austria, and work there legally, pay contributions to Austrian funds, therefore we expect they would receive appropriate benefits from these funds,\u201d Korcok said.  Kneissl said Austria would seek a change on a European level so that children benefits reflect the standard of living, welfare, and purchasing power in each country.  \u201cWe diplomats agreed we should open the door for (social affairs) ministers to discuss the issue,\u201d she added.    In 2016, Austria transferred 273 million euros ($325 million) abroad to EU and European Economic Area countries in benefit payments for 132,000 children.  The European Commission criticized Germany last year for a similar plan to cut child benefits, which was later abandoned.   Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said last week the Austrian proposal was legally possible.   Reporting by Tatiana Jancarikova; Editing by Alison Williams"

A handful of retailers such as Target, Kohl\u2019s Corp and Lululemon Athletica have already reported solid rise in same-store sales for the holiday period and raised their profit forecasts for the fourth quarter.  U.S. stocks also found support from gains across global stock markets in the day, buoyed by upbeat industrial production data from Germany and jump in oil prices.  Oil rose above $68 a barrel, touching its highest since May 2015, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations of lower U.S. crude inventories.  \u201cwe are looking at a quiet day, with no major news. But investors are starting to prepare for the next round of earnings that could keep the market on fire,\u201d said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.  \u201cPeople are going to look for what is going to create opportunity for more money to flow into equity.\u201d  At 8:29 a.m. ET (1329 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 60 points, or 0.24 percent, with 19,077 contracts changing hands.

The winning streak of U.S. stocks had dimmed a bit on Monday but gains in technology, utilities and real estate stocks helped the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq end higher.  Investors are waiting for the start of the quarterly earnings season for more readings on the impact of recent tax cuts and profit forecasts for the rest of the year.  Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an 8 percent increase a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Among stocks, Target jumped about 4 percent in premarket trading after the retailer said its same-store sales for November and December rose 3.4 percent.  Advanced Micro Devices slipped 1.6 percent after Microsoft suspended patches to guard against security threats for computers running AMD chipsets after complaints that the software updates froze their machines.  GoPro fell 2 percent, extending losses from Monday after the action camera-maker flagged a weak holiday quarter that triggered sale talks. The company said it was not actively trying to sell itself but would be willing to partner with a larger sector player.

          "body": "KIEV (Reuters) - A Dutch court has issued a provisional order to freeze the Netherlands-based companies of the flagship business group owned by Ukraine\u2019s richest man in connection with a long-running $820 million lawsuit.  Systems Capital Management (SCM) is owned by Rinat Akhmetov, who has amassed a multi-billion dollar fortune through his conglomerate\u2019s industrial and financial holdings, and owns Ukrainian soccer club FC Shakhtar Donetsk.   In December, a Cypriot court issued a provisional worldwide asset freezing order against Akhmetov and various SCM companies - part of a legal dispute with Cyprus-based firm Raga, which says SCM has not paid it in full for the 2013 sale of telecoms group Ukrtelecom.  A Dutch court has now issued a provisional ruling to freeze  SCM\u2019s Netherlands-registered businesses, which include Ukraine\u2019s largest steel company Metinvest [METIV.UL] and largest private power and coal producer, DTEK [DTEKF.UL].   Raga\u2019s representative sent Reuters a copy of the ruling on Monday. The decisions are not publicly available, but Reuters requested a copy of the ruling from the court on Tuesday.  SCM said on Tuesday it was not aware of the Dutch court decision.   \u201cAs far as the work of the SCM group\u2019s assets is concerned, they continue to work as usual,\u201d it said in an emailed statement  SCM has said it will appeal the Cypriot court\u2019s ruling. The next hearing is on Feb. 27, according to Raga\u2019s representative.  \u201cThe entities of SCM group will also vigorously defend themselves against baseless claims by Raga Establishment Limited that gave rise to issuance of the interim order,\u201d SCM said on Friday.  Raga says SCM has failed to pay an $820 million debt due as a result of arbitration rulings in Raga\u2019s favor in 2017.  The latest court orders against Akhmetov and SCM follow a UK court\u2019s December decision to freeze the worldwide assets of Ukraine\u2019s second- and third-richest men, Ihor Kolomoisky and Gennadiy Bogolyubov, in an unrelated case.

But the gesture has been criticized by Human Rights Watch which said it shows the military junta chief\u2019s \u201ccontempt of media criticism\u201d in a country yet to restore democracy since a 2014 coup.  Seventeen life-sized cutouts of Prayuth have been set up around the government compound ahead of Children\u2019s Day on Saturday. They show Prayuth in various outfits including sportswear, work suits and traditional Thai attire.  On Monday, Prayuth spoke briefly at Government House before a cutout of Prayuth in a suit and tie was brought out. Prayuth, who is known for his abstruse sense of humor, then told journalists to refer any questions to the cardboard cutout.  \u201cAsk this guy,\u201d he said.  Reaction to the bizarre gesture was largely muted on social media on Tuesday but Human Rights Watch said it added to a \u201clong list of his bizarre and bullying reactions to reporters\u201d.  \u201cThailand\u2019s junta leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha continues to show contempt of media criticism and scrutiny,\u201d Sunai Phasuk, senior Thailand researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.  The general is known for going off-script and for his public outbursts which are sometimes dismissed as mildly amusing even by his staunchest critics. His comments have also been menacing.   In 2015 he warned journalists that he had the power to execute them. In another, separate incident he threw a banana peel at a reporter.  Prayuth\u2019s government has announced it will hold a general election in November 2018 after repeatedly delaying the vote.   However, it has yet to lift a ban on political campaigning despite pressure from groups of all political stripes.  \u201cEven when the junta promises to hold an election, there is no open space for media freedom,\u201d said Sunai.  Children\u2019s Day is celebrated annually in Thailand on the second Saturday of January. On the day, armed forces open up military barracks to children to let them pose with weapons and tanks. Children are also invited to sit at the prime minister\u2019s work desk inside Government House.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has set its winter athletes a \u201cbest ever\u201d target of at least five medals at the Pyeongchang Olympics after more than doubling funding since Sochi four years ago.  With a month to go until the Games in South Korea, and several competitors yet to be selected, UK Sport is predicting a possible range of between four and 10 medals based on performances.  Britain won four medals in Sochi, the country\u2019s best haul since 1924, and that tally looks likely to become five after  Russia\u2019s subsequent doping disqualification from the four-man bobsleigh.  UK Sport chair Katherine Grainger recognised at a presentation on Tuesday that Britain, second in the medal table at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics with 27 golds, was not known as a winter nation.  Attitudes have changed, however, and the amount of National Lottery and government funding for the Olympics and Paralympics has risen to more than 32 million pounds ($43 million) across eight sports.  That compares to 14 million for 2014 and six million for Vancouver before that.  The Paralympic target is for at least seven medals, compared to six in Sochi.  \u201cThe target of a best ever Olympic Winter Games is indicative of just how far the athletes and their national governing bodies have progressed over the past four years,\u201d said Team GB Chef de Mission Mike Hay.  \u201cIt is a reflection of the growth we have seen across many of our winter sports that they have medal potential on the world stage and that Britain is now viewed as a credible winter nation.\u201d  Short track speed skater Elise Christie, a triple gold medalist at last year\u2019s world championships, will again be one of the big hopes after bouncing back from three disqualifications in Sochi.  Curling, which has received more than 5 million pounds of funding, is predicted to produce at least one medal with Eve Muirhead\u2019s women\u2019s team strong candidates.  Ski and snowboard has a target of two to three medals, with slalomist Dave Ryding and Nordic skier Andrew Musgrave contenders along with others in park and pipe and snowboard.  Skeleton, with Lizzy Yarnold seeking to defend her Olympic title, is another possible medal as is bobsleigh.  Figure skating, where Britain once hailed Olympic champions in Robin Cousins, John Curry, Jayne Torville and Christopher Dean, was also seen as an outside chance for a first medal since 1994 through Penny Coomes and Nick Buckland.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Defending champion Johanna Konta was bundled out in the first round of the Sydney International by Agnieszka Radwanska and Venus Williams also lost in her first match of the tournament on Tuesday.  Radwanska, overpowered in 82 minutes by Konta in last year\u2019s final, raced to a 6-3 7-5 victory over the Briton at the Olympic Tennis Centre.  Neither player was able to dominate on service in the first set and Konta won just two of her 11 second serve points as Radwanska converted three of her five break opportunities.  Konta again had trouble holding serve in the second set but showed signs of a fightback when she broke while trailing 4-1, but she could not push on as Radwanska sealed victory in one hour, 49 minutes.  Second seed Williams was beaten 5-7 6-3 6-1 by Germany\u2019s Angelique Kerber in under two hours.  Kerber started the first set stronger and looked to have Williams on the ropes when she opened up a 5-3 lead and created two set points on the American\u2019s serve before Williams rallied.  The seven-times grand slam champion survived the Kerber onslaught with an ace and a forehand winner and, with her confidence restored, took the first set.  But Kerber fought back strong as Williams struggled with her service.  The German leveled the match at a set apiece and raced into a 5-0 lead in the decider before Williams rallied again, but the American succumbed to the inevitable on her fifth match point, sending a backhand return wide.  Konta\u2019s first-round loss continued some worrying early season performances for the 26-year-old world number nine.  She struggled last week in Brisbane before withdrawing from her quarter-final with a hip injury.  Radwanska, who was upset by American qualifier Sachia Vickery in the Auckland quarter-finals last week, meets American qualifier Catherine Bellis in the second round in Sydney while Kerber faces Dominika Cibulkova in the quarter-finals.

          "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Lenders to US mid-sized businesses are increasingly concerned about the higher levels of debt held by middle market companies versus a year ago, as well as what they consider to be less restrictive leveraged loan documents, a survey by Carl Marks Advisors found.  Higher leverage levels and borrower-friendly loan agreements, the result of highly competitive market conditions last year that pushed lenders to make such concessions, could impact loan portfolios if business performance comes under pressure.  Carl Marks, a mid-market focused corporate restructuring and investment banking firm, conducted the national online survey in December 2017 of 190 participants from US middle market lending-related fields, including traditional bank lenders, alternative lenders, legal and accounting advisors, restructuring advisors, private equity and hedge fund investors, and other financial and business consultants.  \u201cThis is now the third-longest economic expansion in US history, so it is getting a little bit long-dated. Companies are not necessarily improving and there is a lot of capital - both debt and equity - chasing too few deals,\u201d Patrick Flynn, managing director at Carl Marks, said in an interview ahead of the survey\u2019s release. \u201cBut while there is relatively more concern today than a year ago, it is not necessarily a predictor that the next contraction is any closer.\u201d  The survey found that 76% of respondents are more concerned than they were at the beginning of 2017 about leverage levels at US middle market companies.  \u201cIn 2017 many a transaction has added debt, but there has not been a lot of value created,\u201d said Joseph D\u2019Angelo, a partner at Carl Marks. \u201cThere are not a lot of unencumbered assets left to borrow more money against. If a company doesn\u2019t perform through that, it will likely see a restructuring.\u201d  Leverage on middle market institutional deals increased in 2017 to 5.51x total debt to Ebitda compared to 4.95x in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of a company\u2019s operating performance.  Regarding concessions that lenders have offered to borrowers and private equity sponsors in the face of aggressive market conditions, 48% of respondents said they considered loan documents executed in 2017 to be less restrictive for borrowers than those executed immediately prior to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Thirty-five percent said they did not consider documents to be less restrictive, while 17% said they were unsure.  Middle market covenant-lite issuance reached an all-time high of US$25bn in 2017, LPC data show. By comparison, before the financial crisis, 2007 middle market covenant-lite volume totaled US$7.49bn.  \u201cThere is a fully functioning credit market and pressure to deploy capital remains robust. It\u2019s hard to predict what will trigger the pendulum back towards lender-friendly terms. Currently it seems that lender pushback is still being solved with price and terms,\u201d Flynn said.  Loan document concessions resulting in covenant-lite loans or springing covenants with lower triggers are of primary concern for respondents in 2018, followed by the allowance of add backs to Ebitda calculations.  Covenant-lite refers to loans that are stripped of certain lender protections, including financial maintenance tests requiring the borrower to meet monthly or quarterly performance standards. Such tests serve as early warning signs in a potential default scenario. Boosting Ebitda, meanwhile, can increase a company\u2019s financial flexibility with respect to incurring additional debt or setting restricted payments, thereby increasing credit risk and weakening investor protections.  \u201cAs long as there are as many different funding sources and they keep raising capital, there are no forces that would influence loan documents to tighten up,\u201d said D\u2019Angelo.  As for types of lenders expected to face the greatest challenges in their loan portfolios this year, 26% of respondents said mezzanine lenders are at the top of the list. Business Development Companies (BDCs) were next in line with 23%, 18% said distressed investors and 14% selected traditional banks. Specialty finance companies and direct lenders were tied at 6.84% each, while bank asset-based lenders and equipment finance companies are ranked least likely to face trouble, at less than 5% each.  \u201cMany BDCs make investments in much smaller companies, which can be more vulnerable to economic contraction. BDCs also have a higher cost of capital relative to regulated banks, which dictates looking to invest in places that justify their cost of capital, which can also translate into added risk,\u201d said Flynn.  Despite heightened concerns about leverage and loan documentation, respondents were notably split regarding technical and payment defaults in 2018. Forty-three percent said deafults would increase and the same share said they would stay the same this year.  \u201cWe don\u2019t really expect much difference in 2018. If the economy can continue to grow, we expect to see more sector specific situations. Changes continue to ripple through healthcare with downward pressure on both federal and state budgets,\u201d said D\u2019Angelo. \u201cThe bitter chill has given the energy sector a boost. With prices increasing, there is more confidence around the table to do more constructive deals. We could even see some M&A there.\u201d (Reporting by Leela Parker Deo; Editing by Lynn Adler and Jon Methven)"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Judges, not the government, will be in charge of enforcing French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s proposed new legislation to fight fake news on the Internet, a minister said on Tuesday, dismissing concerns over state control of information.  Macron, a target of fake news and of a major data hack during his run for the presidency last year, announced plans last week to give judges powers to delete some content ion the Internet, close a user\u2019s account or block access to a website during election campaigns.  The plans also include giving French media regulator CSA new powers to remove broadcasters\u2019 rights to air content in France if it is deemed to be fake news.  The proposals quickly ran into opposition from lawmakers who warned of a risk to civil liberties, and from Twitter users who derided it by posting absurd statements under the hashtag #InventYourFakeNews.  \u201cThe judge will be there and he will judge,\u201d Culture Minister Francoise Nyssen told Reuters, in response to a question on how Macron\u2019s plan to counteract fake news online would work in practice.  Pressed to address concerns about whether the law would allow the authorities to muzzle opposition, Nyssen brushed aside such fears by saying that the proposed new powers would not be in the hands of the executive.  \u201cOn the one hand you have the CSA and on the other judges. So it\u2019s not the executive that will be getting involved,\u201d Nyssen told Reuters in an interview during a visit to London.  Macron strongly criticized Russian state-backed media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik during a visit to France by Russian President Vladimir Putin last year, denouncing them as \u201cagents of influence and propaganda\u201d who spread lies about him.  Without naming any particular media, Nyssen said that under the proposed new rules the CSA would be empowered to quickly remove broadcasting rights from any outlet that was deemed to be largely untrue and aimed at destabilizing French democracy.  \u201cWe are talking about media backed by foreign money who broadcast in a nefarious way information to destabilize, information that is false,\u201d said Nyssen.  \u201cWe have to think about how to extend the CSA\u2019s powers so that it could step in, not at the moment of the granting of broadcasting rights but further down the line, based on the reality of what is happening with such outlets.\u201d  She was at pains to say that the new powers to crack down on fake news were only part of the strategy, and that it was also crucial to work on educating everyone in society to better judge what constituted reliable news and what did not. She said lots of work was under way to further that agenda.  Nyssen was in London to meet with BBC executives to discuss the British public broadcaster\u2019s own thinking on the issue of how to tackle fake news.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens\u2019 preparations for the Australian Open hit a speed bump on Monday when she was bundled out of the Sydney International first round by Italy\u2019s Camila Giorgi.  Stephens, who has not played since the Fed Cup final in November, looked rusty against the big-hitting Giorgi and made 35 unforced errors as she lost 6-3 6-0 to the 26-year-old in just over an hour.  World number 13 Stephens has not won a match since beating Madison Keys in the final at Flushing Meadows in September.  She lost both singles encounters in the Fed Cup against Belarus, lost twice in the WTA Elite Trophy event in Wuhai and suffered first-round losses in two tournaments in China.  \u201cI trained in Italy, my home, and felt so very good. I did six weeks of preparation. It was great. Very good,\u201d said Giorgi, who missed the back end of last season with an elbow injury.  \u201cI made a few errors at the start but then I played my game and it was good after that.\u201d  Giorgi will next meet twice Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, who went through when last year\u2019s surprise Australian Open semi-finalist Mirjana Lucic-Baroni retired after losing  the first set 6-1.  Another former grand slam champion also progressed with Germany\u2019s 2016 Melbourne Park title winner Angelique Kerber saving two match points to outlast Lucie Safarova 6-7(3) 7-6 (8) 6-2.  Kerber\u2019s victory sends her into a second round clash with multiple grand slam champion Venus Williams.  Slovakian dynamo Dominika Cibulkova also reached the last 16 with a quickfire 6-3 6-1 demolition of eighth seeded Latvian Anastasija Sevastova.  Sydney\u2019s weather continued to wreak havoc with Sunday\u2019s extreme heat replaced by storms with hail, lightning and rain all halting the Kerber-Safarova clash.  The Australian Open, the opening grand slam of the year, runs from Jan. 15-28.  Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington and Nick Mulvenney in Sydney; Editing by Peter Rutherford/Amlan Chakraborty"

Fury was cleared by UK Anti-Doping in December to resume his fighting career after agreeing a two-year backdated ban for an anti-doping violation.  \u201cHe can be himself now and the public will see a different side to him,\u201d Davison told ESPN.  \u201cHe is unbeaten and now he can be who he needs to be.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has set its winter athletes a \u201cbest ever\u201d target of at least five medals at the Pyeongchang Olympics after more than doubling funding since Sochi four years ago.  With a month to go until the Games in South Korea, and several competitors yet to be selected, UK Sport is predicting a possible range of between four and 10 medals based on performances.  Britain won four medals in Sochi, the country\u2019s best haul since 1924, and that tally looks likely to become five after  Russia\u2019s subsequent doping disqualification from the four-man bobsleigh.  UK Sport chair Katherine Grainger recognised at a presentation on Tuesday that Britain, second in the medal table at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics with 27 golds, was not known as a winter nation.  Attitudes have changed, however, and the amount of National Lottery and government funding for the Olympics and Paralympics has risen to more than 32 million pounds ($43 million) across eight sports.  That compares to 14 million for 2014 and six million for Vancouver before that.  The Paralympic target is for at least seven medals, compared to six in Sochi.  \u201cThe target of a best ever Olympic Winter Games is indicative of just how far the athletes and their national governing bodies have progressed over the past four years,\u201d said Team GB Chef de Mission Mike Hay.  \u201cIt is a reflection of the growth we have seen across many of our winter sports that they have medal potential on the world stage and that Britain is now viewed as a credible winter nation.\u201d  Short track speed skater Elise Christie, a triple gold medalist at last year\u2019s world championships, will again be one of the big hopes after bouncing back from three disqualifications in Sochi.  Curling, which has received more than 5 million pounds of funding, is predicted to produce at least one medal with Eve Muirhead\u2019s women\u2019s team strong candidates.  Ski and snowboard has a target of two to three medals, with slalomist Dave Ryding and Nordic skier Andrew Musgrave contenders along with others in park and pipe and snowboard.  Skeleton, with Lizzy Yarnold seeking to defend her Olympic title, is another possible medal as is bobsleigh.  Figure skating, where Britain once hailed Olympic champions in Robin Cousins, John Curry, Jayne Torville and Christopher Dean, was also seen as an outside chance for a first medal since 1994 through Penny Coomes and Nick Buckland.

          "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Chinese court has sentenced two people to life imprisonment for fraud in a 15.6 billion-yuan ($2.39 billion) pyramid scheme that sucked in more than 200,000 people.  The key figures in the scheme, Huang Dingfang and Cai Keyi, were convicted on Monday at the Hangzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court, according to a statement on the court\u2019s website.  Nineteen others involved were given sentences of up to 12 years, the court in the eastern Chinese city said.  Huang set up Longyan E-commerce Co Ltd in January 2015 and worked with another firm owned by Cai to swindle over 200,000 investors out of more than 15.6 billion yuan, the court said.  They promised annual returns of more than 250 percent to investors who paid in 4,000 yuan each. They then set up a third firm to sell shares, saying it would go public in the United States.  The court said it had ordered the 21 defendants to return over 5.7 billion yuan to more than 170,000 investors.\u00a0   China has launched a campaign to stamp out pyramid schemes which typically promise people they can get rich by joining and then recruiting new investors.  Cases investigated by Chinese police in the first nine months of 2017 involved nearly 30 billion yuan, the official Xinhua News Agency said in October.

          "body": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Israeli jets and ground-to-ground missiles struck Syria early on Tuesday, Syria\u2019s army said, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated he would do what was needed to stop Hezbollah gaining \u201cgame-changing\u201d Iranian weapons.  The Syrian army said in a statement carried by state television that Israeli jets fired missiles at the al-Qutaifa area near Damascus from inside Lebanese airspace at 2:40 a.m. (0040 GMT) and Syrian air defenses hit one of the planes.  Israel then fired rockets from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, but the Syrian defenses brought them down, the army said, adding that Israeli jets fired a final barrage of four rockets from inside Israel, one of which was intercepted by Syrian air defenses while the others caused material damage.  Israel has pledged to prevent Syrian territory being used for Iran to set up bases or transfer high-quality weaponry to Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group, which has been helping Damascus beat back a six-year-old rebellion.          The Israeli military declined to comment. Although the Israeli air force chief last August disclosed that his corps had struck in Syria around 100 times, Israel\u2019s policy is generally not to confirm or deny such operations.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in answer to a reporter\u2019s question about the strikes that Israel\u2019s policy was to stop Hezbollah moving \u201cgame-changing weapons\u201d out of Syria.   \u201cWe back it up as necessary with action,\u201d he said, without explicitly confirming Israel carried out Tuesday\u2019s strikes.  In its statement, the Syrian army repeated previous warnings of serious repercussions for the strikes and repeated its past accusation that Israel was using attacks to support militant groups in Syria.  A European diplomat speaking earlier this week said there was an understanding between the United States and Russia that Hezbollah and other foreign fighters would be removed from the area in Syria close to the Israeli border.   \u201cI don\u2019t think that has happened very much up till now and that is a source of concern,\u201d the diplomat said.

          "body": "* Morrisons beats forecasts with Christmas sales up 2.8 pct  * Morrisons shares rise as much as 4.8 pct  * Surveys show Tesco the best \u2018big 4\u2019 performer at Christmas  * Discounters Aldi and Lidl still winning market share  * Squeezed UK shoppers focus on food, drink over Christmas (Adds detail on discounters, analyst comment, updates shares)  By James Davey  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s fourth biggest supermarket chain Morrisons beat sales growth forecasts over Christmas while industry data indicated market leader Tesco outperformed smaller listed rivals during the festive season.  The survey data from both Kantar Worldpanel and Nielsen showed Tesco enjoyed the strongest performance of Britain\u2019s big four chains over the Christmas quarter with total sales growth put at 3.1 percent and 3.4 percent respectively.  The data showed second placed Sainsbury\u2019s and third ranked Asda performed solidly, but also that privately-owned German discounters Aldi UK and Lidl UK continued to outpace the sales growth of all the big four, winning market share from all but Tesco.  At Christmas discounters have historically lost market share compared with earlier in the year as many shoppers trade up to the big four in search of quality favourites.  \u201cRising to the challenge, Aldi and Lidl collectively managed to attract nearly one million additional households during the past three months,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail at Kantar Worldpanel.  Though their total sales growth of 16.8 percent in the 12 weeks to Dec. 31 was boosted by store openings, it also reflected work to improve premium ranges - in Aldi\u2019s case products such as Aberdeen Angus beef roasting joints and Irish cream liqueur.  Aldi and Lidl have both said this month they will step-up investment in 2018.  With Britons facing pressure from slow wage growth and the jump in inflation that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, company updates and data this month have shown they prioritised spending on food and drink over the holiday season.  Shoppers cut back on almost everything else in the last three months of 2017, causing the biggest fall in non-grocery spending since 2009, figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed on Tuesday.  \u201cThe divergence between growth in sales of food and non-food has never been so stark,\u201d BRC CEO Helen Dickinson said.  Shares in Morrisons were up 1.7 percent at 1250 GMT after its trading update showed it attracted more customers with competitive prices, expanded premium ranges and an improved online range.  Though Kantar said grocery inflation was 3.7 percent in the 12 weeks to Dec. 31, analysts at Bernstein said consumers were \u201cdialing out\u201d about 50 percent of that by switching to cheaper products, meaning there was still some volume growth.  Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s were up 2 percent, while Tesco was down 0.8 percent, having risen 12 percent over the last three months.  Sainsbury\u2019s and Lidl will publish updates on Wednesday, with Tesco to follow on Thursday.  Bradford, northern England-based Morrisons said like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, rose 2.8 percent in the 10 weeks to Jan. 7 - ahead of analysts\u2019 average forecast of 1.7 percent and third quarter growth of 2.5 percent. It said like-for-likes volumes were up.  Under CEO David Potts, Morrisons is trying to broaden its business by improving the performance of its 500 UK stores while also pursuing growth in online and wholesale markets. Its performance comprised retail growth of 2.1 percent and wholesale growth of 0.7 percent.  \u201cWe were able to differentiate in range, value and service enough for increasing numbers of customers to choose Morrisons,\u201d former Tesco executive Potts told reporters.  He said the total price of Morrisons\u2019 basket of 100 key Christmas items was held at last year\u2019s level.  But despite beating sales forecasts, Morrisons said its profit expectations for 2017-18 were unchanged.  Prior to Tuesday\u2019s update, analysts\u2019 average forecast for 2017-18 underlying pretax profit was 371 million pounds ($503 million), up from 337 million pounds in 2016-17.  Potts joined Morrisons in 2015 to lead a recovery after it was badly hurt by the discounters\u2019 rise in its northern heartland and the strategy failures of previous management.  He has now delivered over two years of underlying sales growth but has a long way to go to reach previous profit levels. Morrisons made 935 million pounds in 2011-12.

          "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian historian whose exposure of Soviet leader Josef Stalin\u2019s crimes angered state officials is due to begin enforced psychiatric testing this week amid fears he will be falsely declared insane, his lawyer said on Tuesday.   Yuri Dmitriev, 61, is on trial in northwest Russia on charges brought by state prosecutors of involving his adopted daughter, then 11, in child pornography, of illegally possessing \u201cthe main elements of\u201d a firearm, and of depravity involving a minor.  Some of Russia\u2019s leading cultural figures say Dmitriev was framed because his focus on Stalin\u2019s crimes - he found a mass grave with up to 9,000 bodies dating from the Soviet dictator\u2019s Great Terror in the 1930s - jars with the latter-day Kremlin narrative that Russia must not be ashamed of its past.  The narrative has taken on added importance ahead of a March presidential election which polls show incumbent Vladimir Putin, who uses his country\u2019s World War Two victory when Stalin was in charge to bolster national pride, is on track to win.     Putin asserted last year that what he called an \u201cexcessive demonization of Stalin\u201d was being used to undermine Russia.  Dmitriev faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the charges, which he denies.   A previous psychiatric evaluation declared him to be of sound mind and a court-sanctioned expert group found no pornographic content in nine photographs of his daughter that are at the center of the case against him, overturning the earlier findings of other experts commissioned by prosecutors.   But on Dec. 27, in an unexpected twist, the court ordered that the same nine photos be re-examined by experts for a third time. It also granted the prosecution\u2019s request that Dmitriev undergo enforced psychiatric testing to determine whether he has \u201csexual deviations.\u201d  However, the court declined a prosecution request to extend his detention beyond Jan. 28.  Dmitriev\u2019s lawyer, Viktor Anufriev, told Reuters on Tuesday he had written to the supreme court of Karelia, the region where his client is being tried, to appeal against the court order.  \u201cHe\u2019s already been through one (psychiatric) test. The conclusions were fine, no evidence of deviance was found, and the results were not contested by prosecutors,\u201d said Anufriev.  \u201cThis (latest testing) was ordered illegally.\u201d       Dmitriev was flown to Moscow at the end of last year to be evaluated at a psychiatric clinic, the Serbsky Centre, that was infamous in Soviet times for providing false testimony to allow the authorities to lock up dissidents in psychiatric facilities.  Anufriev said he expected a doctor to be appointed to handle his client\u2019s psychiatric case later on Tuesday.  He said he hoped the evaluation, which could last for up to a month, would be objective, but was concerned that state security officials in Karelia might pressure doctors.  He did not specify which officials he was referring to.  State TV broadcast last year what it billed as an expose of Dmitriev and of Memorial, the organization for which he worked, complaining that foreign money was being used to provide a distorted and overly negative version of Russian history.  The Kremlin has told Reuters it does not get involved in cases like Dmitriev\u2019s, while the Investigative Committee of Karelia, whose investigators submitted the original case for prosecution, did not respond to Reuters\u2019 questions about whether there was a political side to the trial. They said only that there had been enough evidence to open a criminal case.    Anufriev, Dmitriev\u2019s lawyer, said he was worried.  \u201cPerhaps if they can\u2019t convict him (of child pornography) they need to declare him insane,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a purely Soviet procedure. Make accusations and then end things by locking someone up in a psychiatric facility.\u201d  Editing by Mark Heinrich"

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Group (PEUP.PA) said on Tuesday it plans to eliminate 1,300 French jobs in 2018 using a new form of voluntary cuts introduced by President Emmanuel Macron.  The departures, roughly equivalent to buyouts, are part of 2,200 voluntary job cuts planned this year, down from 2,670 in 2017, a company spokesman said, confirming comments by a CFTC union representative. The figure excludes thousands of new hires and job eliminations by attrition.  The Peugeot maker is among a first handful of companies to make use of the new flexible labor measures introduced by decree within months of Macron\u2019s election last May.  Unions have criticized the so-called collective contractual termination agreements, which let companies negotiate layoffs without having to prove they are in financial difficulties. Clothes retailer Pimkie is seeking union approval to cut 208 jobs under the new measures.  Besides the voluntary job cuts at PSA, the Paris-based carmaker aims to hire 1,300 workers on permanent French contracts in 2018 along with 2,000 younger staff on internships or time-limited work-study contracts.  \u201cThe number of new hires and voluntary outplacements will therefore be balanced,\u201d the company said in a statement.

Dai Clement will become global head of power, utilities and infrastructure investment banking at Jefferies, while Lorna Shearin will be the European head from April. Both will be based in London, the sources told Reuters.  Clement was European head of utilities at RBC, while Shearin headed the bank\u2019s infrastructure team in Europe. RBC said on its website that during the first half of 2017, it had advised on nine infrastructure transactions, totalling more than $27 billion globally.  Jefferies declined to comment on the new hires, while RBC confirmed both Clement and Shearin had decided to leave the Canadian bank at the start of the year. Clement and Shearin did not respond to requests for comment on their moves.  Jefferies, a unit of Leucadia National Corp, has been on a recent hiring spree, adding 11 managing directors in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) over the past year, including investment bankers from JP Morgan, HSBC, Nomura and boutique bank Perella Weinberg.  It has also hired Raj Khatri from Australia\u2019s Macquarie as its European head of metals and mining.  Khatri is due to start in February, while Ed Matthews is expected to join the UK investment team from investment group Shore Capital in April.  Jefferies ranked 19 in the 2017 European M&A financial advisory table compiled by Thomson Reuters, up from 39 in 2016.

          "body": "* Yen rises after Bank of Japan trims JGB purchases  * Crude oil futures rise to highest since May 2015  * Samsung\u2019s guidance disappoints, weighing on tech sector  * Nikkei probes highest levels since November 1991  * Europe helps world stocks extend flying start to year  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Marc Jones  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - A tweak to the Bank of Japan\u2019s bond-buying programme shunted the yen higher on Tuesday, while gains from commodity stocks as oil hit its highest since 2015 helped world shares maintain their flying start to the year.  MSCI\u2019s all-country world stocks index posted another record high as Europe\u2019s main markets shrugged off a tech wobble in Asia and instead cheered Christmas trading updates, the oil gains and more forecast-beating data from Germany.  Wall Street was expected to inch to fresh peaks too when trading resumes, though there will be plenty of cross-market cross-winds to tack through.  U.S. Treasury yields \u2014 the biggest driver of global borrowing costs \u2014 had briefly touched a nine-month high in Europe on the mix of higher oil prices, good economic data and an unexpected move by the BOJ to trim its long-dated bond buys.  That stoked speculation it could start to wind down its stimulus policy this year and saw the yen rise as much as half a percent to 112.50 yen to the dollar.  \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be perceived as a monstrous signal of the end of monetary easing but it shows that even the tiniest announcement on a quiet day can have a reaction,\u201d said Societe Generale\u2019s global head of currency strategy Kit Juckes.  \u201cAnd it shows that when they start turning their ship around from this policy, the yen is going to go miles.\u201d  Since it adopted its yield-curve-control policy in 2016, the BOJ has occasionally tweaked its buying, but some market players seemed to take Tuesday\u2019s move as a signal of possible intent.  The dollar, meanwhile, was rising against most other major currencies including the euro, which having approached three-year highs last week slipped to a 10-day low of $1.1941 .  That was despite the biggest increase in German industrial output since September 2009 and suggested investors might be becoming more cautious after a months-long rally that has pushed \u201clong\u201d euro positions to record levels.  \u201cI don\u2019t think right now levels substantially above $1.20 are justified,\u201d Reichelt said. \u201cI know the market is very optimistic about the euro, but if you look at the data and the central bank, the ECB (European Central Bank) is still on an expansionary path.\u201d  Wall Street\u2019s expected tick higher later comes with the fourth-quarter earnings season there just beginning and investors unashamedly upbeat.  Citi analysts say global earnings revisions have now been upgraded for 14 weeks in a row, the best run of weekly upgrades since their data series started in 2000.  Although high levels of earnings revisions are usually seen at the start or end of the economic/market cycle, they said \u201cit is still too early to call the end of this cycle\u201d.  Commodity markets are one of potential factors in that. Oil prices jumped to their highest since mid-2015 on Tuesday amid OPEC-led production cuts and a dip in American drilling.  Brent crude the international benchmark, jetted as high as $68.29 a barrel, its highest since May 2015, with U.S. WTI crude doing the same as it rose to $61.91.  Beyond equalling that 2015 high, which was a short intra-day spike, Tuesday\u2019s high was the strongest for WTI since December, 2014, at the start of the oil market slump.  \u201cSpeculators continued to increase their net long in ICE Brent ... According to exchange data, speculators increased their position by 4,175 lots to leave them with a record net long of 565,459 lots,\u201d ING bank said.  Asian trading saw its own milestones. Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed at its highest since November 1991, China chalked up an eighth day of gains and stocks in the Philippines jumped 2 percent to a new all-time high.  South Korea\u2019s KOPSI was dragged down though by a 3.1 percent drop in Samsung\u2019s shares after its profit guidance disappointed some analysts who are also wary about longevity of the boom in demand for the firm\u2019s memory chips.  Emerging market stocks were a touch lower anyway having hit a 6-1/2 year high this week.  Angola\u2019s kwanza currency was braced for an expected devaluation, while Venezuela\u2019s battered bonds were dealt another blow as a key market body recommended that they should be traded on the presumption that they have as-good-as defaulted.

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) said it planned to boost the number of planes it makes in China under a deal signed in Beijing on Tuesday to expand co-operation at its Tianjin assembly plant.  The provisional deal was signed during a state visit to China by French President Emmanuel Macron.  Airbus said the latest Tianjin agreement would result in production increasing to six aircraft per month - up from four at present - at the local final assembly line for the Airbus A320-family of jets.  The industrial ramp-up will target five aircraft by early 2019 and six per month by early 2020, it added in a statement.  A Beijing signing ceremony did not, however, include any deal for Airbus to sell aircraft to China, despite earlier expectations of a contract timed to coincide with Macron\u2019s visit.  Industry sources had said Airbus was negotiating to sell around 100 planes to China\u2019s state purchasing agency, though a deal had not been flagged as part of the diplomatic preparations for the visit.  New orders for Airbus jetliners have historically featured during such state visits by French leaders.  China regularly splits large orders between Europe and the United States to cope with its fast-expanding airline traffic, but the momentum has recently been with rival Boeing (BA.N), which sold 300 jets during a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump last year.  China, however, placed a large order for 140 Airbus jets during a visit to Germany by President Xi Jinping last July.  Some sources say Chinese officials are disappointed about a deal last year for Airbus to buy the CSeries jet project from Bombardier (BBDb.TO), derailing talks with Chinese investors after Ottawa intervened to keep the struggling program in Western hands.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - At the stroke of midnight and in the early hours of Tuesday morning dozens of same-sex couples exchanged wedding vows across Australia as laws making the nation the 26th in the world to legalize gay marriage took effect.  \u201cIt was just magical,\u201d Diana Ribeiro told Special Broadcasting Service television, after her minute-past-midnight marriage in Melbourne to her wife Deanne Ribeiro was solemnized before about 60 cheering guests.  \u201cFor me Deanne\u2019s always been my wife, always been the love of my life and today\u2019s not going to change that, it\u2019s just about equality really, and being able to finally be legal in Australia,\u201d she said.  Australian\u2019s parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage in December after a nationwide postal survey returned an overwhelming majority in favor of the unions.  The survey result prompted relief, then celebration among campaigners who had for decades pushed for change, and later cheers and singing on the floor of parliament when the law passed. Some Australian states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago.  Because a month\u2019s notice is required for the state to recognize a marriage, the Rieberos\u2019 wedding and several other same-sex marriages reported in the local press were among the first to be recognized under the new laws.  Several same-sex couples already wed in December after the notice period was waived for reasons such as one member of the couple falling gravely ill, or to allow a legal wedding to go ahead when a non-binding ceremony was already planned.  Religious organizations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition to same-sex marriage and pressed unsuccessfully for broad protections for religious objectors, which would have allowed florists and bankers to refuse service to same-sex couples if the unions were legalized.

          "title": "Canada's Kingsbury awaits Pyeongchang coronation",
          "body": "LONDON(Reuters) - It is fair to say Quebec has a proud tradition of producing winning mogul skiers.  Starting with Jean-Luc Brassard, seen by many as the godfather of modern moguls and the winner of Olympic gold in 1994, through to reigning champion Alexandre Bilodeau, the French-speaking region of Canada has an illustrious history in the discipline.  Now there is another Quebecois skier ready to take the Olympic crown.  Four years ago, Mikael Kingsbury had to make do with a silver medal in Sochi as compatriot Bilodeau claimed his second consecutive gold in the men\u2019s moguls.  Since then Bilodeau has retired, leaving the door open for Kingsbury take over his mantel. It would be an understatement to say Kingsbury has taken advantage of his chance.  The 25-year-old has dominated the discipline for four years.   In February 2017, Kingsbury claimed his sixth consecutive overall FIS World Cup gold medal. He has also won two Ski World Championship golds and holds the all-time record for the number of World Cup wins and podium finishes.   In last year\u2019s World Cup, Kingsbury had almost double the number of points of the man in second place, Benjamin Cavet of France.  His supremacy was only challenged last season by Japanese upstart Ikuma Horishima, who claimed double moguls gold at the 2017 World Championships in Sierra Nevada in a surprising result. Kingsbury could only manage bronze.  Kingsbury knows his relentless winning form means he is the man to beat in Pyeongchang.  \u201cI feel I have a target on my back, like most of the people want to beat me,\u201d Kingsbury told Reuters from his home in Quebec.  \u201cI won nine out of 11 World Cup races last year so I for sure put myself as the favorite for the games and I know everyone is training hard and wants to be on top for this season.\u201d  Canada\u2019s success in the moguls down the years has understandably led to high expectations that Kingsbury will bring home another gold medal from Pyeongchang.  Bilodeau\u2019s back-to-back success at Vancouver and Sochi, as well as gold and silver for the Dufour-Lapointe sisters in the women\u2019s event four years ago, means gold medals in the moguls are demanded at every Olympics by expectant Canadian fans.  Kingsbury is aware of this pressure but knows that if he can replicate his form of the past four years then nobody should be able to touch him in Pyeongchang.  \u201cNow I have been ranked first in the world since Sochi so there is a bit more pressure to perform well,\u201d admitted Kingsbury. \u201cI would say that people back home and the people that follow me have got used to a high standard of results so I want to show them I can do it at the Olympics.\u201d  \u201cIf I stick to my game plan then I know I put myself in a very good position to be on the podium again and win my first gold medal.\u201d   Kingsbury believes his main rivals at Pyeongchang are likely to come from within his own team.   Canada had four men in the 2017 World Cup top 10 last season and it would be a shock if the country had no representation on the podium in South Korea. All four of those men come from Quebec.  Kingsbury attributes this success to the unique snow conditions in the region.   \u201cWe have very small mountains there and it is hand-made snow,\u201d said Kingsbury.   \u201cIt is super icing and we don\u2019t have the distraction of powder and big mountains so we stick to moguls and have the great examples like Jean-Luc Brassard and Alex Bilodeau, so growing up watching them we always had someone to look up to.\u201d  Kingsbury admits he is very close to the other members of his team and enjoys training, traveling and competing with them.  However, by the time the Olympics roll around there will only be one thing on Kingsbury\u2019s mind; the final jewel in his crown, an Olympic gold medal.  \u201cWhen we are in the start gate it doesn\u2019t matter. You need to forget it is your friend and just do your thing.\u201d   \u201cHope they are doing well, just not as good as you. They can have second and third!\u201d  Reporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Two countries, Belarus and China, have dominated the men\u2019s aerials at the last three Winter Olympics and look set to do the same this time around in Pyeongchang.  While traditions, resources and basic geography often sustain the same rivalries in Olympic events, the long-standing duel in the acrobatic skiing event of aerials pits two countries with very different backgrounds against one another.  The unlikely pairing of Belarus and China have won six of the last nine medals in the men\u2019s aerials, including all three golds.   Belarus, through Anton Kushnir in Sochi and Alexi Grishin at Vancouver, have claimed gold at the past two games, twice relegating the Chinese competitor to third place.   China\u2019s Xiaopeng Han was the victor in Turin in 2006, edging out Belarusian Dmitri Dashinski into second.   The two nations are also strong in the women\u2019s event, with five medals between them since 2006. However, Australian Lydia Lassila, gold medallist in Vancouver and bronze winner in Sochi, can never be ruled out as she hopes to appear at a record fifth winter games.   Following the latest round of the World Cup in Moscow on Saturday \u2013 won by American Kiley McKinnon \u2013 Belarus\u2019 Hanna Huskova leads the overall standings, followed by China\u2019s Mengtao Xu, who won the World Cup last year in the women\u2019s aerials.  If the women\u2019s competition heading into Pyeongchang is more diverse, the men\u2019s look set to once again come down to Belarus and Russia.  Last season, every single World Cup men\u2019s aerials event was won by either Belarus\u2019 Kushnir \u2013 who went on to claim the title \u2013 or one of three Chinese athletes.   This year is no different, with China\u2019s Zongyang Jia leading the standings. Kushnir is second, his compatriot Maxim Gustik is third and Guangpu Qi of China is in fourth.  The depth of quality among the two teams is staggering, with each possessing four athletes in the top 14 in the World Cup rankings, making it difficult for other nations to even dream about reaching the final in Pyeongchang, let alone claiming a podium place.  Speaking to Reuters shortly before the World Cup event in Russia, the head coach of the Belarusian freestyle skiing team, Nikolai Kozeko, said his nation\u2019s aerial prowess stems from the country\u2019s rich traditions in acrobatics and gymnastics.  \u201cWe are not strong in all disciplines of freestyle,\u201d admitted Kozeko.  \u201cOur strength is aerial skiing.\u00a0Belarus has strong acrobatics, diving and gymnastics traditions from the Soviet era and that has helped the creation of training centres for aerial skiing. These training centres were founded on the traditions of these sports.\u201d  China also has a history of success in gymnastics and Kozeko believes these skills are perfectly suited for assimilation into aerial skiing, where athletes perform similar twists, turns and somersaults to achieve scores.  Maintaining dominant success is a challenge for any national sports program, yet China and Belarus seem to have the traditions, talent and structure in place to continue their hotly-contested battle for aerial supremacy into Pyeongchang and beyond.

          "title": "East China Sea oil tanker burns for third day as winds, high waves lash rescuers",
          "body": "BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - Strong winds, high waves and toxic gases are hindering dozens of rescue boats struggling to locate missing sailors from a stricken oil tanker in the East China Sea and to extinguish a fire that has burned for the past three days on the ship.  The poor conditions, with rain and waves as high as 3 meters (10 feet), frustrated efforts to tame the fire and search for the 31 remaining tanker crew members, China\u2019s Ministry of Transport said in a statement on Tuesday.  The flames were forcing the South Korean Coast Guard\u2019s search and rescue team to stay as far as 3 miles (4.8 km) away from the tanker, two South Korean officials told Reuters.  The Chinese government said late on Tuesday it had not found a \u201clarge-scale\u201d oil leak, and the ultra light oil, known as condensate, was burning off or evaporating so quickly it would leave little residue - less than 1 percent - within five hours of a spill. That reduces the chances of a crude-style oil slick.  Still, condensate is highly volatile when exposed to air and water and concerns were growing the tanker could explode and sink while a flotilla of 13 search and rescue vessels comb a 900-square-nautical-mile (3,100 sq km) area for the crew.   The tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608), run by Iran\u2019s top oil shipping operator, National Iranian Tanker Co, collided on Saturday with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050), carrying grain from the United States, about 160 nautical miles (300 km) off China\u2019s coast near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta.  The Sanchi was carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate to South Korea, equivalent to about 1 million barrels and worth about $60 million.  Chinese state media CCTV showed footage on Monday of boats dousing the flames with water as plumes of thick dark smoke continued to billow from the tanker.   The size of the oil spill from the ship and the extent of the environmental harm were not known, but the disaster has the potential to be the worst since 1991 when 260,000 tonnes of oil leaked off the Angolan coast.  \u201cWe can\u2019t grasp the level of oil contamination at this moment. The cargo is still on fire, so it is hard to figure out if oil is being spilled,\u201d Park Sung-dong, an official from South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, told Reuters.  The body of a crew member was found on Monday in the water near the tanker, China\u2019s transport ministry said. It had been handed over to the civil affairs bureau.  The crew of the Sanchi are all Iranian nationals except for two Bangladeshi citizens.   Satellite imagery of the ship showed the blaze has weakened since the weekend, although the strong winds are dragging the tanker away from the Chinese coast, according to Greenpeace.  Between Sunday and Monday, the floating inferno traveled some 50 kilometers (31 miles) south east, according to Rashid Kang, campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia.  Another major concern is damage to the region\u2019s rich fish reserves. The Zhoushan fishing ground where the crash occurred is known as one of the biggest in the East China Sea, particularly for mackerel and croaker, according to Greenpeace.  The CF Crystal suffered limited damage and the 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, were rescued by a passing fishing trawler on Saturday night, according to a report posted by state-owned Xinhua News to its Twitter account on Tuesday.  \u201cThe fire was so fierce. It kept exploding like bombs. So loud,\u201d said Zhu Tingwen, a sailor on the fishing boat.  The trawler from Zhejiang province scoured for survivors on the tanker, but could not get close enough because of the fire, Xinhua said.  \u201cAnyone will go for a rescue in this case,\u201d said the fishing boat captain Zheng Lei. \u201cIt just happened to be me.\u201d  The freighter has been taken to a port near Shanghai where investigators will start work on assessing the cause of the disaster, the government said.   China\u2019s transport ministry warned toxic gas from the tanker was harmful to the rescue workers and that protective clothing and gas testing equipment was being dispatched to the emergency teams.          Trying to contain a spill of condensate, which is extremely low in density, highly toxic and much more explosive than normal crude oil, may be difficult.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to see a slick like with crude, but it\u2019s soluble, toxic and flammable, which is why we\u2019re seeing the fire. A lot of it is burning off or evaporating,\u201d said Greenpeace\u2019s Kang.

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Industrial production and exports from Germany rose more than expected in November, prompting the government to raise its estimate of growth for 2017 and signaling that its expansion would carry on this year.  Industrial output jumped 3.4 percent for the month, the biggest increase since September 2009, the Federal Statistics Office reported on Tuesday, overshooting a 1.8 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.  Seasonally adjusted exports for November rose 4.1 percent on the month and domestic demand pushed imports up 2.3 percent. Both figures beat Reuters forecasts, and they widened the trade surplus to 22.3 billion euros ($26.61 billion) from 19.9 billion euros in October.  The figures and buoyant business sentiments suggest \u201cthat the German economy ended 2017 with a bang after the third quarter\u2019s impressive 0.8 percent expansion,\u201d Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics wrote in a note.  Soon after the data, the government raised its 2017 growth forecast to 2.2 percent from a previous estimate of 2.0 percent.  \u201cThe economy is stable,\u201d Deputy Economy Minister Matthias Machnig said. \u201cAnd we assume that it will continue at about the same level.\u201d  The economy has expanded every year for the past eight years, and it has continued to surge even though Chancellor Angela Merkel has failed to form a new coalition government after September\u2019s national election, creating a political deadlock.   The rise in November\u2019s output confirmed economists\u2019 assumption that a 1.2 percent drop in October was caused by limited factors, namely two public holidays.  A breakdown of the output data showed the main drivers were capital and consumer goods spending as well as construction.      The Statistics Office will publish on Thursday full-year gross domestic product figures for 2017, which are forecast to show 2.4 percent growth. Some analysts expect it to do better.  \u201cGerman GDP looks set to have risen by slightly more than our above-consensus forecast of 2.5 percent in 2017 and we expect a similarly strong pace of growth this year,\u201d McKeown said.

The orders were placed by two international utilities in December, Nordex said, declining to disclose their names. One order is for 67 turbines for a project in Texas, where it previously supplied turbines to Germany\u2019s E.ON.  Shares in Nordex jumped 5.5 percent, hitting their highest level in three months. The stock more than halved in 2017 after a drastic profit warning and the subsequent resignation of its then CEO.  Nordex is the fourth-largest supplier in the United States, the world\u2019s second-biggest market for wind turbines, after Vestas, General Electric and Siemens Gamesa.  The other unidentified customer ordered 196 turbines for two U.S. projects, with a capacity of 319 MW and 300 MW, respectively, Nordex said, adding deliveries would start in the summer.  Nordex\u2019s announcement comes less than a month after a final U.S. tax bill retained key production credits for wind energy projects, reversing earlier versions in which the subsidies had been significantly cut.

Weakness against the Japanese currency was the exception for the dollar, which was trading at an 11-day high against a basket of six major currencies, continuing a recovery from four-month lows plumbed at the start of the year.

While Tuesday\u2019s move was considered largely technical, it surprised some market players and emboldened those analysts who see an exit from the monetary easing programme coming by the end of 2018.  \u201cThey reduced the amount of bonds purchased in the market, which is being seen as the start of a tapering approach, but we\u2019ve been expecting this for quite a while... so I wouldn\u2019t expect too much yen strength for now,\u201d said UBS Wealth Management currency strategist Daniel Trum, in Zurich.  \u201cWe expect dollar/yen to rebound to 115, because the global economy is strong and risk aversion is low, and therefore demand for safe havens like the yen is relatively limited,\u201d he added.  Most economists surveyed in a Reuters poll in December said the BoJ would start scaling back its stimulus in late 2018 or after.  The euro - which last week threatened to reach its highest levels in three years, hitting a four-month high - slipped further below $1.20, trading down 0.3 percent on the day at a 12-day low of $1.1921, with investors cautious after a months-long rally.  \u201cI don\u2019t think right now levels substantially above $1.20 are justified,\u201d said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt.  \u201cI know the market is very optimistic about the euro, but if you look at the data and the central bank, the ECB (European Central Bank) is still on an expansionary path.\u201d  Many analysts said a correction was inevitable for the common currency after an almost 5 percent rally against the dollar in just six weeks thanks to signs of acceleration in the euro zone economy.  Speculators\u2019 net long position in euro/dollar futures in Chicago reached a record high last week, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday, pointing to potential for profit-taking.

          "title": "Chapuis feeling pressure to replicate Sochi success",
          "body": "LONDON(Reuters) - France swept the podium in the men\u2019s ski cross four years ago in Sochi, with Jean-Frederic Chapuis coming away with the gold, and such is the depth of talent in the country that some are predicting a repeat performance in Pyeongchang.  Six of the top 20 in the 2017 ski cross rankings were French and with the likes of Terence Tchiknavorian and Francois Place to contend with, Chapuis knows he has no room for error if he is to have any chance of claiming back-to-back Olympic titles.  \u201cIt is a lot of pressure because we are a strong team,\u201d Chapuis told Reuters from the Ski Cross World Cup event in Montafon in December, adding that nine athletes had competed for just four places spots on the team.  Despite their rivalry, the French team remains very close. Chapuis said having a top class team to compete with in training is imperative for ski cross.  \u201cThe team in ski cross is really important because it is an individual sport but we need the other guys to train with because we have to run 4x4. So if you want to train with other guys then you need a team,\u201d said Chapuis.  The French know that with great success comes increased expectation, particularly from a French public eager for further glory in South Korea at the Feb. 9-25 Games.  \u201cThey expect us all to be on the podium,\u201d said Chapuis.  \u201cThey do not realize what we did in Sochi because it was really unbelievable and you have to have luck. Sometimes they don\u2019t realize it was just an awesome day and they think if you have a strong team it is easy to put one, two, three on the podium but it is really hard.\u201d  Ski cross, a relatively new entry into the Olympics after its debut in 2010, has quickly become one of the most popular events at the Games. This is largely due to it being easy for fans to understand and appreciate, as well as being an exciting race that could change at any moment.  This unpredictability is great for the viewer but Chapuis knows that a small amount of luck can determine the success of a season, not least at the Olympics.  \u201cIn this sport you have to have a little bit of luck because so many things can happen. In 2014 in Sochi everything went all good and perfect,\u201d said Chapuis.  \u201cYou could be in good shape but then you miss the start and the whole race is out because when you are not in front it is really hard to over-take and you have to take more risks.\u201d  Chapuis is aware the French now have a target on their backs and rivals such as Brady Leman of Canada and Slovenian Filip Flisar will be gunning for them.  \u201cEveryone wants to be on top and take our place,\u201d he said.  \u201cFor the last three years, the French team was the best so every nation wants to take our place. Second is always looking at first and thinking \u2018how can I beat him?\u2019\u201d  Editing by Peter Rutherford"

          "title": "Bill Clinton joins calls for release of Reuters journalists in Myanmar",
          "body": "YANGON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Calls grew on Tuesday for the release of two Reuters journalists in Myanmar facing accusations of breaching the country\u2019s Official Secrets Act, with former U.S. President Bill Clinton urging that they be freed immediately.  The reporters, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12. They are due to make their second appearance in court in the main city of Yangon on Wednesday.  The two had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a military crackdown that followed militant attacks on security forces.  \u201cA free press is critical to a free society - the detention of journalists anywhere is unacceptable. The Reuters journalists being held in Myanmar should be released immediately,\u201d Clinton said in a Twitter post.  Clinton was U.S. president for much of the 1990s when the United States pressed Myanmar\u2019s then military rulers to release democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi from years of house arrest.  Suu Kyi won a 2015 election and formed a government in early 2016, although she is barred by the constitution from becoming president. She has made no public comment on the case of the two Reuters reporters. Her spokesman has said the case would be handled according to the law.  The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying the two reporters were \u201carrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces\u201d.  It said they had \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media\u201d.  The Official Secrets Act dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.  Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power referred in a post on Twitter to the detention of the two reporters as \u201can outrage & symptom of a world without credible US leadership\u201d.  Government officials from some of the world\u2019s major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for the release of the reporters.  Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the two.  \u201cAs they near their hearing date, it remains entirely clear that they are innocent of any wrongdoing,\u201d Adler said in a statement on Monday.  A group of Myanmar reporters asked the government on Monday for details about the arrest of the two, arguing that the case could have implications for the ability of journalists to do their jobs.  Authorities have blocked most media access to the north of Rakhine State, where Rohingya militant attacks on the security forces on Aug. 25 sparked the military crackdown.  The United Nations has condemned the Myanmar military campaign as ethnic cleansing. Buddhist-majority Myanmar has rejected the accusation.  The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) also called on Myanmar to release the two reporters.  \u201cThe proceedings against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are a transparent attempt to intimidate the media and to prevent coverage of the unfolding tragedy of the Rohingya people in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state,\u201d said Steven Butler, CPJ\u2019s Asia programme coordinator, in a statement on Monday.  Separately, an independent Myanmar media outlet, the Development Media Group, which is based in and focuses on coverage of events in Rakhine State, also called for the release of the pair.  \u201cThe Myanmar government must do a great deal more than it does now to allow media organisations the freedom to form, collect and distribute news and information,\u201d the group said in statement on Tuesday.

          "title": "Wrong wax? Snow problem for Olympic athletes",
          "body": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - It is the one subject skiers and snowboarders cannot stop obsessing about at the Winter Olympics - how best to wax their equipment to ensure maximum speed and stability.   Get it right in the waxing shed and you can glide your way to Olympic glory. Get it wrong and the snow can turn to treacle.  In cross-country skiing, athletes must ensure they get their \u201ckick wax\u201d right in order to keep pace in the uphill stretches and former biathlete Jean-Marc Chabloz told Reuters there was no room for error.   \u201cIt is completely crucial, completely crucial,\u201d the four-time Olympian said as he demonstrated the basic techniques for waxing cross-country skis.    \u201cYou can\u2019t win a race with bad skis, it just doesn\u2019t work. Everyone is at their best, so it\u2019s small margins.\u201d  Chabloz, who now coaches student athletes at the Jamtlands High School in Sweden, expertly cleaned his skis and used a hot  iron to spread a thin layer of glide wax before polishing them to a smooth finish.   For cross-country skiers and biathletes, getting the balance right is tough. They need to be able to ski as fast as possible across flat ground and downhill, but they also need a good grip to get them to the top of hills.   To achieve this, a stickier \u201ckick wax\u201d is applied to the ski in the area under and in front of the foot, while the rest is given a coating of glide wax.   But it is not just a case of what wax is applied where. There are hundreds of products on the market for different conditions.   \u201cThere\u2019s many parameters that have to be taken into account when waxing. The quality of the snow - is it rough or fine? It\u2019s the temperature, humidity and of course the distance,\u201d Chabloz explains.  The 50-year-old, who competed for Switzerland in Albertville, Lillehammer, Nagano and Salt Lake City, said he always got his waxing right at the Olympics, but others are not so lucky.  At the 2014 Sochi Games, both Norwegian relay teams performed poorly and the blame was laid squarely on the waxing team. And at a World Cup event in Ruka, Finland in November, it happened again.  \u201cThe skiers had good grip when they tested the skis, and bad grip when they skied the race. It\u2019s easy to explain - it was a waxing miss,\u201d Knut Nystad, who is responsible for waxing in the Norwegian team, told reporters.   For Alpine skiers and snowboarders, the requirements are different, with sharp edges often needed on their equipment to cut into the artificial snow and icy surfaces of downhill and slopestyle courses.   When waxing, teams must also take into account the fact that conditions can change during a race, which makes waxing more an art than a science.  But for Chabloz, the key is not to complicate things.   \u201cThere\u2019s a whole pile of waxing products out there, so you have to try to stick to something simple that you know, and then there\u2019s no big worries,\u201d he said.

          "body": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Having once hoped to travel alongside ski cross racer Anna Holmlund to Pyeongchang for the Winter Games, her Swedish team mates have instead found inspiration in her remarkable recovery from life-threatening injuries sustained in a training crash.  The accident occurred on a training run in Innichen, northern Italy on Dec. 19 2016. She was flown home and kept in a medically-induced coma for several months, with Sweden ski cross director Joar Batelson revealing in May that she was conscious and communicating again in May last year.   Holmlund is now back on her feet and taking her first careful steps in a remarkable recovery that few thought possible. She hopes to attend Idrottsgalan, Sweden\u2019s sporting awards dinner, in the middle of January together with her boyfriend and fellow ski race Victor Ohling Norberg.   \u201cIn our eyes, who feared the worst, she has made fantastic steps forward,\u201d Batelson told reporters recently as the team returned to Innichen for a competition in December.   Having made its Olympic debut at the 2010 Games in Vancouver, the hair-raising sport of ski cross has fast become popular with viewers around the world.   Competitors race against one another through a course featuring man-made and natural jumps and turns at high speeds, and while intentional contact with others is banned, crashes are not uncommon.   Few, however, result in the kind of serious head injuries that left Holmlund, who won Olympic bronze in Sochi, fighting for her life.   Cross-country skier Charlotte Kalla, who won gold for Sweden with a stunning last leg in the women\u2019s 4x5km relay, paid an emotional tribute to Holmlund as the two opened a ski centre together in December.   \u201cAnna, you are a fighter, your fighting spirit to come back after the accident gives us perspective on life,\u201d she told Holmlund in front of an audience of hundreds of locals in Alnoe, close to where Holmlund now lives in Sundsvall.   \u201cYour will and attitude have made a strong impression on me. Let your fire be an inspiration to us all - nothing is given, life is what you make it, in good times and in bad.\u201d   While Kalla heads off to chase more gold in Pyeongchang, Holmlund will stay at home to continue her recovery.  \u201cAnna is always happy, when I arrive now it\u2019s to a very happy girl, the same old Anna,\u201d her father Lars told Swedish radio.   \u201cIt\u2019s better and better, but there\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d  Editing by Peter Rutherford"

          "body": "LONDON(Reuters) - It is fair to say Quebec has a proud tradition of producing winning mogul skiers.  Starting with Jean-Luc Brassard, seen by many as the godfather of modern moguls and the winner of Olympic gold in 1994, through to reigning champion Alexandre Bilodeau, the French-speaking region of Canada has an illustrious history in the discipline.  Now there is another Quebecois skier ready to take the Olympic crown.  Four years ago, Mikael Kingsbury had to make do with a silver medal in Sochi as compatriot Bilodeau claimed his second consecutive gold in the men\u2019s moguls.  Since then Bilodeau has retired, leaving the door open for Kingsbury take over his mantel. It would be an understatement to say Kingsbury has taken advantage of his chance.

He has also won two Ski World Championship golds and holds the all-time record for the number of World Cup wins and podium finishes.   In last year\u2019s World Cup, Kingsbury had almost double the number of points of the man in second place, Benjamin Cavet of France.  His supremacy was only challenged last season by Japanese upstart Ikuma Horishima, who claimed double moguls gold at the 2017 World Championships in Sierra Nevada in a surprising result. Kingsbury could only manage bronze.  Kingsbury knows his relentless winning form means he is the man to beat in Pyeongchang.  \u201cI feel I have a target on my back, like most of the people want to beat me,\u201d Kingsbury told Reuters from his home in Quebec.  \u201cI won nine out of 11 World Cup races last year so I for sure put myself as the favorite for the games and I know everyone is training hard and wants to be on top for this season.\u201d  Canada\u2019s success in the moguls down the years has understandably led to high expectations that Kingsbury will bring home another gold medal from Pyeongchang.  Bilodeau\u2019s back-to-back success at Vancouver and Sochi, as well as gold and silver for the Dufour-Lapointe sisters in the women\u2019s event four years ago, means gold medals in the moguls are demanded at every Olympics by expectant Canadian fans.  Kingsbury is aware of this pressure but knows that if he can replicate his form of the past four years then nobody should be able to touch him in Pyeongchang.  \u201cNow I have been ranked first in the world since Sochi so there is a bit more pressure to perform well,\u201d admitted Kingsbury. \u201cI would say that people back home and the people that follow me have got used to a high standard of results so I want to show them I can do it at the Olympics.\u201d  \u201cIf I stick to my game plan then I know I put myself in a very good position to be on the podium again and win my first gold medal.\u201d   Kingsbury believes his main rivals at Pyeongchang are likely to come from within his own team.   Canada had four men in the 2017 World Cup top 10 last season and it would be a shock if the country had no representation on the podium in South Korea. All four of those men come from Quebec.  Kingsbury attributes this success to the unique snow conditions in the region.   \u201cWe have very small mountains there and it is hand-made snow,\u201d said Kingsbury.   \u201cIt is super icing and we don\u2019t have the distraction of powder and big mountains so we stick to moguls and have the great examples like Jean-Luc Brassard and Alex Bilodeau, so growing up watching them we always had someone to look up to.\u201d  Kingsbury admits he is very close to the other members of his team and enjoys training, traveling and competing with them.  However, by the time the Olympics roll around there will only be one thing on Kingsbury\u2019s mind; the final jewel in his crown, an Olympic gold medal.  \u201cWhen we are in the start gate it doesn\u2019t matter. You need to forget it is your friend and just do your thing.\u201d   \u201cHope they are doing well, just not as good as you. They can have second and third!\u201d  Reporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty"

          "title": "Unlikely rivalry in Aerials set to continue at Pyeongchang",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Two countries, Belarus and China, have dominated the men\u2019s aerials at the last three Winter Olympics and look set to do the same this time around in Pyeongchang.  While traditions, resources and basic geography often sustain the same rivalries in Olympic events, the long-standing duel in the acrobatic skiing event of aerials pits two countries with very different backgrounds against one another.  The unlikely pairing of Belarus and China have won six of the last nine medals in the men\u2019s aerials, including all three golds.   Belarus, through Anton Kushnir in Sochi and Alexi Grishin at Vancouver, have claimed gold at the past two games, twice relegating the Chinese competitor to third place.   China\u2019s Xiaopeng Han was the victor in Turin in 2006, edging out Belarusian Dmitri Dashinski into second.   The two nations are also strong in the women\u2019s event, with five medals between them since 2006. However, Australian Lydia Lassila, gold medallist in Vancouver and bronze winner in Sochi, can never be ruled out as she hopes to appear at a record fifth winter games.   Following the latest round of the World Cup in Moscow on Saturday \u2013 won by American Kiley McKinnon \u2013 Belarus\u2019 Hanna Huskova leads the overall standings, followed by China\u2019s Mengtao Xu, who won the World Cup last year in the women\u2019s aerials.  If the women\u2019s competition heading into Pyeongchang is more diverse, the men\u2019s look set to once again come down to Belarus and Russia.  Last season, every single World Cup men\u2019s aerials event was won by either Belarus\u2019 Kushnir \u2013 who went on to claim the title \u2013 or one of three Chinese athletes.   This year is no different, with China\u2019s Zongyang Jia leading the standings. Kushnir is second, his compatriot Maxim Gustik is third and Guangpu Qi of China is in fourth.  The depth of quality among the two teams is staggering, with each possessing four athletes in the top 14 in the World Cup rankings, making it difficult for other nations to even dream about reaching the final in Pyeongchang, let alone claiming a podium place.  Speaking to Reuters shortly before the World Cup event in Russia, the head coach of the Belarusian freestyle skiing team, Nikolai Kozeko, said his nation\u2019s aerial prowess stems from the country\u2019s rich traditions in acrobatics and gymnastics.  \u201cWe are not strong in all disciplines of freestyle,\u201d admitted Kozeko.  \u201cOur strength is aerial skiing.\u00a0Belarus has strong acrobatics, diving and gymnastics traditions from the Soviet era and that has helped the creation of training centres for aerial skiing. These training centres were founded on the traditions of these sports.\u201d  China also has a history of success in gymnastics and Kozeko believes these skills are perfectly suited for assimilation into aerial skiing, where athletes perform similar twists, turns and somersaults to achieve scores.  Maintaining dominant success is a challenge for any national sports program, yet China and Belarus seem to have the traditions, talent and structure in place to continue their hotly-contested battle for aerial supremacy into Pyeongchang and beyond.

          "title": "Wrong wax? Snow problem for Olympic athletes",
          "body": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - It is the one subject skiers and snowboarders cannot stop obsessing about at the Winter Olympics - how best to wax their equipment to ensure maximum speed and stability.   Get it right in the waxing shed and you can glide your way to Olympic glory. Get it wrong and the snow can turn to treacle.  In cross-country skiing, athletes must ensure they get their \u201ckick wax\u201d right in order to keep pace in the uphill stretches and former biathlete Jean-Marc Chabloz told Reuters there was no room for error.   \u201cIt is completely crucial, completely crucial,\u201d the four-time Olympian said as he demonstrated the basic techniques for waxing cross-country skis.    \u201cYou can\u2019t win a race with bad skis, it just doesn\u2019t work. Everyone is at their best, so it\u2019s small margins.\u201d  Chabloz, who now coaches student athletes at the Jamtlands High School in Sweden, expertly cleaned his skis and used a hot  iron to spread a thin layer of glide wax before polishing them to a smooth finish.   For cross-country skiers and biathletes, getting the balance right is tough. They need to be able to ski as fast as possible across flat ground and downhill, but they also need a good grip to get them to the top of hills.   To achieve this, a stickier \u201ckick wax\u201d is applied to the ski in the area under and in front of the foot, while the rest is given a coating of glide wax.   But it is not just a case of what wax is applied where. There are hundreds of products on the market for different conditions.   \u201cThere\u2019s many parameters that have to be taken into account when waxing. The quality of the snow - is it rough or fine? It\u2019s the temperature, humidity and of course the distance,\u201d Chabloz explains.  The 50-year-old, who competed for Switzerland in Albertville, Lillehammer, Nagano and Salt Lake City, said he always got his waxing right at the Olympics, but others are not so lucky.  At the 2014 Sochi Games, both Norwegian relay teams performed poorly and the blame was laid squarely on the waxing team. And at a World Cup event in Ruka, Finland in November, it happened again.  \u201cThe skiers had good grip when they tested the skis, and bad grip when they skied the race. It\u2019s easy to explain - it was a waxing miss,\u201d Knut Nystad, who is responsible for waxing in the Norwegian team, told reporters.   For Alpine skiers and snowboarders, the requirements are different, with sharp edges often needed on their equipment to cut into the artificial snow and icy surfaces of downhill and slopestyle courses.   When waxing, teams must also take into account the fact that conditions can change during a race, which makes waxing more an art than a science.  But for Chabloz, the key is not to complicate things.   \u201cThere\u2019s a whole pile of waxing products out there, so you have to try to stick to something simple that you know, and then there\u2019s no big worries,\u201d he said.

          "body": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Having once hoped to travel alongside ski cross racer Anna Holmlund to Pyeongchang for the Winter Games, her Swedish team mates have instead found inspiration in her remarkable recovery from life-threatening injuries sustained in a training crash.  The accident occurred on a training run in Innichen, northern Italy on Dec. 19 2016. She was flown home and kept in a medically-induced coma for several months, with Sweden ski cross director Joar Batelson revealing in May that she was conscious and communicating again in May last year.   Holmlund is now back on her feet and taking her first careful steps in a remarkable recovery that few thought possible. She hopes to attend Idrottsgalan, Sweden\u2019s sporting awards dinner, in the middle of January together with her boyfriend and fellow ski race Victor Ohling Norberg.   \u201cIn our eyes, who feared the worst, she has made fantastic steps forward,\u201d Batelson told reporters recently as the team returned to Innichen for a competition in December.   Having made its Olympic debut at the 2010 Games in Vancouver, the hair-raising sport of ski cross has fast become popular with viewers around the world.   Competitors race against one another through a course featuring man-made and natural jumps and turns at high speeds, and while intentional contact with others is banned, crashes are not uncommon.   Few, however, result in the kind of serious head injuries that left Holmlund, who won Olympic bronze in Sochi, fighting for her life.   Cross-country skier Charlotte Kalla, who won gold for Sweden with a stunning last leg in the women\u2019s 4x5km relay, paid an emotional tribute to Holmlund as the two opened a ski centre together in December.   \u201cAnna, you are a fighter, your fighting spirit to come back after the accident gives us perspective on life,\u201d she told Holmlund in front of an audience of hundreds of locals in Alnoe, close to where Holmlund now lives in Sundsvall.   \u201cYour will and attitude have made a strong impression on me. Let your fire be an inspiration to us all - nothing is given, life is what you make it, in good times and in bad.\u201d   While Kalla heads off to chase more gold in Pyeongchang, Holmlund will stay at home to continue her recovery.  \u201cAnna is always happy, when I arrive now it\u2019s to a very happy girl, the same old Anna,\u201d her father Lars told Swedish radio.   \u201cIt\u2019s better and better, but there\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d  Editing by Peter Rutherford"

          "body": "LONDON(Reuters) - France swept the podium in the men\u2019s ski cross four years ago in Sochi, with Jean-Frederic Chapuis coming away with the gold, and such is the depth of talent in the country that some are predicting a repeat performance in Pyeongchang.  Six of the top 20 in the 2017 ski cross rankings were French and with the likes of Terence Tchiknavorian and Francois Place to contend with, Chapuis knows he has no room for error if he is to have any chance of claiming back-to-back Olympic titles.  \u201cIt is a lot of pressure because we are a strong team,\u201d Chapuis told Reuters from the Ski Cross World Cup event in Montafon in December, adding that nine athletes had competed for just four places spots on the team.  Despite their rivalry, the French team remains very close. Chapuis said having a top class team to compete with in training is imperative for ski cross.  \u201cThe team in ski cross is really important because it is an individual sport but we need the other guys to train with because we have to run 4x4. So if you want to train with other guys then you need a team,\u201d said Chapuis.  The French know that with great success comes increased expectation, particularly from a French public eager for further glory in South Korea at the Feb. 9-25 Games.  \u201cThey expect us all to be on the podium,\u201d said Chapuis.  \u201cThey do not realize what we did in Sochi because it was really unbelievable and you have to have luck. Sometimes they don\u2019t realize it was just an awesome day and they think if you have a strong team it is easy to put one, two, three on the podium but it is really hard.\u201d  Ski cross, a relatively new entry into the Olympics after its debut in 2010, has quickly become one of the most popular events at the Games. This is largely due to it being easy for fans to understand and appreciate, as well as being an exciting race that could change at any moment.  This unpredictability is great for the viewer but Chapuis knows that a small amount of luck can determine the success of a season, not least at the Olympics.  \u201cIn this sport you have to have a little bit of luck because so many things can happen. In 2014 in Sochi everything went all good and perfect,\u201d said Chapuis.  \u201cYou could be in good shape but then you miss the start and the whole race is out because when you are not in front it is really hard to over-take and you have to take more risks.\u201d  Chapuis is aware the French now have a target on their backs and rivals such as Brady Leman of Canada and Slovenian Filip Flisar will be gunning for them.  \u201cEveryone wants to be on top and take our place,\u201d he said.  \u201cFor the last three years, the French team was the best so every nation wants to take our place. Second is always looking at first and thinking \u2018how can I beat him?\u2019\u201d  Editing by Peter Rutherford"

          "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - European gold-backed exchange-traded funds added more than double the amount of tonnes that North American ones did in 2017, growing their assets by 13.9 percent, the World Gold Council said on Tuesday.  Though North America contained more than half the amount of global exchange-traded fund holdings, European funds added the most to their gold-backed ETFs last year. The additional 148.6 tonnes were valued at $5.8 billion.  \u201cWe believe that European investors were less certain about the economic recovery of their region and more worried about global instability than their U.S. counterparts,\u201d said Juan Carlos Artigas, director of investment research for the World Gold Council, which publishes the monthly report, covering 75 gold-backed ETFs.  \u201cAnd their interest rate levels remain quite low and in some cases are still negative, pushing investors to seek more alternatives to traditional investments.\u201d  European funds captured 75 percent of global inflows, led by German-listed funds accounting for 35 percent of inflows, the council said.  \u201cConsumer research indicates that in places like Germany, gold is often used as a long-term strategic asset,\u201d Artigas said.  North American funds grew assets under management by adding 62.9 tonnes in 2017, a 5.6 percent increase, the council said. Flows were valued at $2.9 billion.  Asian funds lost 12.9 tonnes valued at $404.8 million in 2017, a 13 percent drop from the previous year, the data showed.  Global gold-backed exchange-traded funds added 197.5 tonnes in 2017, an 8.4 increase of assets under management. The flows were worth $8.2 billion. Total global assets under management for gold-backed ETFs for 2017 were valued at $98.1 billion.  For 2017, global net inflows spread across North America, Europe and Asia totaled 221.3 tonnes worth $9.1 billion, the council said. Flows out of global gold-backed ETFs totaled 23.8 tonnes worth $860.4 million. (Reporting by Renita D. Young; Editing by Richard Borsuk)"

          "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone unemployment fell to a new nine-year low in November thanks to strong economic growth, data showed on Tuesday, but the jobless rates differ widely across the single currency bloc.  The European Union\u2019s statistics office Eurostat said the jobless rate in the 19 countries sharing the euro was 8.7 percent in November, down from 8.8 percent in October and the lowest since January 2009.  The number of unemployed fell by around 107,000 people to 14.263 million in the euro area, Eurostat said.  Emerging from years of economic malaise caused by the sovereign debt crisis, the euro zone economy is now growing strongest pace in a decade - at 2.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2017.  But the average unemployment rate for the whole single currency area masks great differences within it \u2014 Germany has an unemployment rate of 3.6 percent while Greece\u2019s was at 20.5 percent in September, Spain\u2019s was at 16.7 percent in November and Italy\u2019s was 11.0 percent.  Even greater differences were seen in youth unemployment numbers, Germany leading with 6.6 percent and Greece having the highest number at 39.5 percent, followed by Spain at 37.9 percent and Italy at 32.7 percent.

          "body": "* Futures up: Dow 44 pts, S&P 1.25 pts, Nasdaq 6 pts  By Sruthi Shankar  Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures edged higher on Tuesday, keeping alive Wall Street\u2019s 2018 winning streak that is powered by robust economic data and expectations of earnings boost from corporate tax cuts.  Asian and European markets rose to a record high, buoyed by an upbeat industrial production data from Germany and gains in commodity stocks.  Oil rose above $68 a barrel, touching its highest since May 2015, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations of lower U.S. crude inventories.  The stock rally slowed slightly on Monday but gains in technology, utilities and real estate stocks helped the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq end higher.  At 7:00 a.m. ET (1200 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 44 points, or 0.17 percent, with 14,256 contracts changing hands.  S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.25 points, or 0.05 percent, with 87,300 contracts traded.  Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 6 points, or 0.09 percent, on volume of 17,592 contracts.  Investors awaited the start of the quarterly earnings season for more readings on the impact of recent tax cuts and profit forecasts for the rest of the year.  Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an 8 percent increase a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Among stocks, Target jumped 4 percent after the retailer said its same-store sales for November and December rose 3.4 percent.  GoPro fell 4.3 percent to $6.28 premarket, extending losses from Monday after the action camera-maker flagged a weak holiday quarter that triggered sale talks. The company said it was not actively trying to sell itself but would be willing to partner with a larger sector player.  PayPal climbed 0.81 percent after Cowen & Co upgraded the digital payments company\u2019s stock to outperform.  Shares of sportswear retailer Under Armour fell 3.3 percent after Susquehanna downgraded the stock to \u201cneutral\u201d.  The U.S. Labor Department is set to release data on job openings and labor turnover for November at 10:00 a.m. ET. Job openings are expected to have risen to 6.038 million from 5.996 million in October.  Investors will also look for clues on monetary policy stance from Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari\u2019s speech later in the day.

The provisional deal was signed during a state visit to China by French President Emmanuel Macron.  Airbus said the latest Tianjin agreement would result in production increasing to six aircraft per month - up from four at present - at the local final assembly line for the Airbus A320-family of jets.  The industrial ramp-up will target five aircraft by early 2019 and six per month by early 2020, it added in a statement.  A Beijing signing ceremony did not however include any deal for Airbus to sell aircraft to China, despite earlier expectations of a contract timed to coincide with Macron\u2019s visit.  Industry sources had said Airbus was negotiating to sell around 100 planes to China during the visit, but that details would only become clear during talks at the last minute.

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Tuesday they had arrested a Bosnian Serb man on suspicion of detaining and murdering Bosnian Muslims during the wars that broke up former Yugoslavia almost a quarter of a century ago.  Police said Milorad Obradovic was arrested at Munich airport after Bosnian authorities issued a warrant for his arrest.   The 51-year-old is suspected of taking part in the illegal detention of around 120 Bosnian Muslim civilians in the village of Miska Glava, near the northwestern town of Prijedor, in July 1992, and their summary execution in nearby Ljubija.  \u201cMilorad Obradovic was arrested for the purpose of extradition,\u201d said Joachim Ettenhofer, spokesperson for Munich prosecutors, adding that Bosnian authorities had 14 days to submit a detailed extradition request.  Police were unable to say why Obradovic was in Munich.  Boris Grubesic, a spokesman for Bosnia\u2019s state prosecutor, told Reuters Obradovic is also suspected of killing three Bosnian Muslim, or Bosniak, civilians at a local soccer stadium.   Bosnian authorities have been looking for Obradovic for months, he said, adding that another suspect in this case was recently arrested in neighbouring Montenegro.  The Prijedor region was a stronghold of ultra-nationalist Serbs who sought during the war to drive out Bosnian Muslim and Croat inhabitants to create an ethnically Serb territory. Nearly 3,500 people went missing from Prijedor town alone.  The U.N.\u2019s pioneering war crimes tribunal in The Hague, which finally closed its doors last year, sentenced 16 Bosnian Serbs to a total of 230 years in prison for atrocities in the Prijedor area.  The Bosnian war, during which ethnic Serbs and Croats fought to carve an ethnically pure state out of multi-ethnic Bosnia, was part of a wider Balkan conflagration in which Yugoslavia broke up into seven successor states. A series of wars there cost some 140,000 lives and lasted most of the 1990s.  Reporting by Maja Zuvela and Thomas Escritt; Editing by Catherine Evans"

Terra Firma, which sources say is seeking 3 billion euros ($3.58 billion) for its fourth buyout fund, paid no dividend to its shareholders in the year ending March 2017, it said in company accounts on Thursday, compared with the 3.5 million pounds ($4.7 million) it paid in the previous year.  Since being founded by Guy Hands in 1994, Terra Firma said it has invested over 17 billion euros of equity and 14 billion euros of capital expenditure in 33 businesses.

          "body": "ROME (Reuters) - The leader of Italy\u2019s far-right Northern League ruled out on Tuesday any future government role for party moderate Roberto Maroni, who has been touted as a possible prime minister if the center-right bloc wins the March election.  Maroni, a former interior minister, unexpectedly announced at the weekend that he would not seek re-election this year as president of the wealthy Lombardy region, which is centered on Italy\u2019s business capital Milan.  He told reporters he was standing aside for unspecified \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d, but said he would be ready to help his allies in future, adding: \u201cI know what it means to govern.\u201d  With the center-right bloc leading in opinion polls ahead of the March 4 ballot, Italian newspapers interpreted Maroni\u2019s words as meaning that he wanted to return to central government, perhaps as prime minister.  Northern League leader Matteo Salvini, who has pushed the group to the far right during his four years at the helm, was caught off-guard by Maroni\u2019s announcement and moved quickly to temper the political ambitions of the popular party veteran.  Asked by Radio 24 if Maroni might have a future government role, Salvini said: \u201cIf you leave Lombardy ... which is worth much more than many ministries, if you feel you have reached the end of the road there, then obviously no\u201d.  Salvini has aligned the League with hard-right parties across Europe, including France\u2019s National Front and the anti-Islam Freedom Party in the Netherlands. He wants Italy to exit the euro and promises zero tolerance on illegal immigration.  Berlusconi has repeatedly told reporters that the League is a moderate party, saying Salvini is talking tough for electoral purposes. But Forza Italia officials in private acknowledge they find it much easier to work with League stalwart Maroni.  \u201cWe have worked very well with Maroni in Lombardy and this is the model we would expect to reproduce at a national level if we win power,\u201d said a Forza Italia lawmaker, who was not authorized to talk to the press and declined to be named.  In the event of a center-right victory, Berlusconi and Salvini have agreed that the party that takes more votes will decide who to put forward as prime minister. Salvini says he is the League\u2019s candidate for premier, while Berlusconi, who cannot return to high office because of a 2013 conviction for tax fraud, has yet to decide on a name.  Latest polls put Forza Italia roughly one percentage point ahead of the League. All surveys suggest the center-right bloc will not win enough seats to claim an overall majority, meaning they will need external allies to govern.  Salvini has ruled out any deals with the center-left but shown a willingness to work with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. Marking a major difference between the two parties, Berlusconi has said his main enemy is 5-Star and Maroni echoed his sentiments in a news conference on Monday.  \u201cThe equilibrium between the two main center-right allies will be solid up to the elections, but afterwards it could prove to be more fragile than it seems,\u201d Italy\u2019s top-selling broadsheet Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote on Tuesday.

Fang, who had accompanied President Xi Jinping to his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in April, was abruptly replaced as chief of the Joint Staff Department of the People\u2019s Liberation Army in August with no explanation.   The 67-year-old was subsequently replaced as a member of the Central Military Commission at a key five-yearly Communist Party congress in October, as part of a sweeping military leadership reshuffle.  Dozens of officers have been investigated and jailed, including Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, both former vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission. Guo was jailed for life last year.

          "body": "CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Two mothers have approached a court in south India seeking help to \u201cfree\u201d their daughters from a spinning mill where they work, raising questions on the freedom of movement of thousands of women employed in the Indian textile and garment industry.  Ellamal Raman, 17, and her cousin Bhuvaneshwari, 18, have not been allowed to leave the KPR Mill Limited\u2019s Karumathampatti premises in Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu state since September, according to their mothers.  In their petition to the court - heard on Tuesday - the mothers said that the teenagers have developed severe rashes on their hands, have been bitten by bed bugs and require treatment.  \u201cMy daughter has called home many times since, begging me to bring her back home,\u201d Raman\u2019s mother Chinnaponnu told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  \u201cLast night she was crying and saying she can\u2019t do the work. She has rashes on her hands and the mill won\u2019t let them out.\u201d  KPR Mills Limited - one of the largest manufacturers of yarn in the region, producing approximately 90,000 metric tonnes of cotton annually - said the women were being fairly treated.  Thangavelu Karrupasamy, a manager at the mills, said the girls were being paid minimum wages of 332 rupees ($5) per day and their medical needs were being taken care of.  \u201cSince they joined only in September, they are entitled leave to go home only later this month, during Pongal (harvest festival),\u201d he said. \u201cThe police have come and checked on the girls and we have asked the parents to come to the mill.\u201d  There are more than 1,500 mills in Tamil Nadu, the biggest hub for textile and manufacturers in India, employing up to 400,000 workers to turn cotton into yarn, fabric and clothes.  A majority of the young workers are drawn from poor families and are housed in hostels within the factory or mill premises.  The workers, mostly women, are confined to their hostels after their shifts and are only allowed a weekly visit to the neighborhood market with escorts, campaigners say.  \u201cLike most mills, this one also has high fenced walls and a lot of security,\u201d said Raj Kumar, the lawyer representing the two mothers.  \u201cIt is impossible for anyone to enter or leave the mill premises without the permission of the management.\u201d  The mothers had not been allowed to remove the two teenagers, Kumar said.  On Tuesday, the court directed the police to produce the teenagers before them on Jan. 11, the next date of hearing.

          "title": "Who will lead the Bank of England after Brexit?",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is expected to choose a new central bank chief this year to succeed Canadian Mark Carney, who will step down in June 2019, three months after the country\u2019s scheduled exit from the European Union.  Following is a summary of possible contenders to run the Bank of England (BoE), which oversees the world\u2019s sixth-biggest economy and Britain\u2019s huge finance industry. No one has yet thrown their hat into the ring.  ANDREW BAILEY - the outsider insider  Widely tipped by analysts as Carney\u2019s most likely successor, Bailey reached the role of deputy governor of the BoE with a focus on banks before becoming chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, a financial markets regulator.  During his time at the BoE, Bailey helped to steer Britain\u2019s banks through the global financial crisis, enhancing his reputation as a safe pair of hands.  However, heading the FCA - which roots out misconduct in Britain\u2019s large financial services sector - is fraught with risks. The head of the British parliament\u2019s influential Treasury Committee has criticised Bailey for withholding parts of a report into alleged misconduct by state-owned RBS during the financial crisis. Bailey has cited privacy restrictions.  As FCA boss, Bailey sits on important panels at the BoE that oversee banks. Although he has never been interest-rate setter, he once ran the BoE international economic analysis team.  Bailey acknowledged the speculation about a move to the BoE in an interview published this week. \u201cYou\u2019ll be unsurprised to know this question comes up reasonably often,\u201d Bailey told Financial News. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a job and, I have to be honest with you, I have never spent my time thinking about the one I want to do next.\u201d      BEN BROADBENT AND DAVE RAMSDEN - the deputies   Broadbent and Ramsden are deputy governors for monetary policy and for markets and banking respectively, burnishing their credentials as potential successors to Carney.   Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist who once trained as a classical pianist, is respected for his economic analysis but has less experience on banking oversight, which has become an important part of the BoE governor\u2019s role.  Ramsden only joined the central bank in September although he is no stranger to the Monetary Policy Committee having attended 92 of its meetings in his previous role as the Treasury\u2019s chief economic advisor.  The two other BoE deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods, are less likely contenders. Woods focuses mostly on bank regulation while Cunliffe - a former British ambassador to the EU - would be aged 66 at the start of the term which usually runs for eight years, although Carney has chosen to step down after six.  ANDY HALDANE - the free thinker  The BoE\u2019s chief economist, Haldane has developed a reputation for floating unconventional ideas, including the abolition of cash as a way to give central banks more muscle over the economies they run. In 2012, he praised the anti-capitalist Occupy movement for suggesting new ways to fix the shortcomings of global finance. Haldane has experience of both sides of the Bank, having served previously as executive director for financial stability, overseeing the risks to the economy from the banking system. But he might be seen as too much of a maverick to take the job of governor.  The announcement of Carney, the first non-British governor of the BoE in more than three centuries, was a surprise. Should finance minister Philip Hammond also opt for a less obvious candidate, one name that has appeared in Britain\u2019s media is that of Sharon White, the head of a telecoms regulator and who previously worked at the Treasury. The daughter of Jamaican immigrants, she has won wide praise for her high-profile roles in the public sector. Another outside contender would be Adair Turner, a former chairman of a now defunct financial services regulator who was in the running last time around. He continues to speak about the British economy and has warned of the risks from high debt levels.      The prospect of the left-wing Labour Party taking power in the next year or so is remote but investors are mindful that Prime Minister Theresa May has only a small majority in parliament after last year\u2019s failed election gamble and her Conservative Party is split over how to leave the European Union. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his would-be finance minister John McDonnell are socialists and have in the past proposed that the BoE should fund investment in infrastructure, a big change from its current focus on inflation. If they were to pick the next BoE governor, Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment strategist at Tilney Group, an investment firm, said they might consider former members of an economic advisory committee which included U.S. academic and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and Ann Pettifor, a British economist who is an austerity critic.

          "body": "Jan 9 (Reuters) - Encana Corp  on Tuesday estimated fourth-quarter production from its core assets would top its own forecast, helped by the Canadian oil and gas producer\u2019s efforts to revamp its business.  The company \u2013 in the middle of a five-year plan to boost its output growth rate \u2013 has benefited from focusing on four core North American basins: the Montney and Duvernay in Canada, and the Eagle Ford and Permian in the United States.  Calgary, Alberta-based Encana said it estimates production from these assets increased about 31 percent in the three months ended December, topping the forecast of a 25 percent to 30 percent rise it gave in September.  That would imply Encana\u2019s production from these core assets rose to 310,601 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) in the latest quarter, from 237,100 BOE/d a year earlier.  Encana also forecast production from these assets would increase between 25 percent and 35 percent in the fourth quarter this year without the company spending more than it did last year.  Oil investors have been pressuring producers to improve production without increasing their capital budgets.  Encana said it plans to invest almost all its anticipated 2018 capital in these four core assets, with around 70 percent directed towards the Permian and Montney basins.  Last year, Encana spent around $1.8 billion in developing its assets.  The company will report full fourth-quarter results on Feb 15.

          "body": "(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon regrets having called bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d but would still not be interested in the cryptocurrency, he said in an interview on Fox Business on Tuesday.  Dimon, known for his candid comments, slammed the viability of bitcoin in September. \u201cThe currency isn\u2019t going to work. You can\u2019t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,\u201d he had said at a conference.  The buzz generated by Dimon\u2019s comments spurred more interest in the alt-currency. Bitcoin rose around 30 percent in one month following Dimon\u2019s speech, where he also compared the currency to tulips bulbs in a reference to the famous market bubble from the 1600s.  Dimon's comments were followed by a more tempered view from Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who said the bank was \"very open minded to the potential use cases in future for digital currencies that are properly controlled and regulated.\" (reut.rs/2mies8H)  Despite Dimon\u2019s criticism, several banks, exchange operators and companies eagerly embraced bitcoin, sparking a spectacular rise in the ctyptocurrency.  On Tuesday, bitcoin was down nearly 5 percent at $14,202 in early trading. It traded at $909 a year ago and breached $19,000 in December.  Exchange operators such as CME Group Inc and Cboe Global Markets Inc opened their platforms to allow bitcoin futures trading, while Square Inc rolled out a bitcoin buying/selling feature on its app to a select few. (reut.rs/2AHz1Q1) (reut.rs/2AK55Tq)  Dimon and Lake, however, have commended blockchain - the technology used by bitcoin and other digital currencies - a view echoed by Citigroup Inc CFO John Gerspach and many others across the industry.  \"Blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that,\" Dimon told Fox. (fxn.ws/2AI9LcA)  Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty"

          "body": "(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text)  By Paul Lienert and Joseph White  DETROIT, Jan 9 (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra has made a bold promise to investors that the Detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021.  What Barra has not explained in detail is how GM intends to do what, so far, no major automaker has done.  The answer is a big bet on combining proprietary battery technology, a low-cost, flexible vehicle design and high-volume production mainly in China, according to six current and former GM and supplier executives and six industry experts interviewed by Reuters.  If GM can meet Barra\u2019s ambitious profitability target, then it will house two different businesses by the mid-2020s: A traditional focus in North America on trucks, sport utility vehicles and cars fueled with petroleum, and a global electric car company centered in China, branching into pay-per-use services such as robotaxis.  Barra\u2019s promise to turn a profit is a bold claim in a market segment that has been driven more by government policy than consumer demand, and where Tesla Inc - the world\u2019s largest electric-vehicle manufacturer - is burning through more than $1 billion in cash each quarter selling premium-priced vehicles.  Barra and GM have invested heavily in the electrification strategy, and worked during the past year to persuade investors that GM can compete with Tesla by building on the success of the automaker\u2019s latest electric vehicle, the Chevrolet Bolt EV, and cutting costs along the way.  A key element of the plan, according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s strategy, is slashing the amount of cobalt in GM\u2019s new EMC 1.0 battery system. The price of cobalt \u2013  the single most costly ingredient in current lithium-ion battery cells - has soared in the past two years in expectation of a surge in demand from automakers. Cobalt prices hit a record high this month on the London Metal Exchange.  GM\u2019s new battery design increases the amount of nickel, which enables batteries to store and produce more energy, these people told Reuters.  GM engineers are also working on other design and technological advances, according to executives and company patent filings, including more efficient packaging of batteries in vehicles and improved systems for managing energy flow and cooling the battery cells.  Without providing details, GM has said it expects these changes to cut the cost of battery cells by more than 30 percent, from $145 per kilowatt-hour to less than $100 by 2021.  Battery experts said the full cost of a GM battery pack, such as the one used now in the Bolt EV, is $10,000-$12,000, or nearly one-third of the car\u2019s $36,000 sticker price.  By 2021, however, that price could drop to $6,000, according to consultant Jon Bereisa, a former GM engineering director who helped develop the Chevrolet Volt hybrid and spearheaded much of the automaker\u2019s early lithium-ion battery development.  With improvements in battery chemistry and packaging, Bereisa said, the next-generation Bolt \u201ccould deliver a 45-percent increase in range for about the same (battery) pack cost, or the same range at 45 percent less pack cost.\u201d  Pam Fletcher, vice president in charge of GM\u2019s global electric vehicle programs, and other GM executives would not comment on specifics of the new battery system, which is slated to be introduced in 2020-2021.  To be sure, electric vehicles account for only a small fraction of global auto sales. Like other manufacturers, GM is banking not only on reducing its own costs and improving vehicle performance, but also on increased demand driven by higher government-mandated electric vehicle quotas in China that are intended to help reduce pollution and the country\u2019s dependence on petroleum.  In addition to improving battery and vehicle design and performance, GM is working with Chinese partner SAIC to reduce the cost of assembling electric cars. Sources said GM and SAIC are designing dedicated electric vehicle factories in China that are far smaller, less complex and more efficient than a conventional car plant.  GM has more capital for electric vehicle development because of Barra\u2019s decisions to sell money-losing European operations, exit other unprofitable markets and invest in a new generation of highly profitable, petroleum-fueled large pickup trucks, launching later in 2018.  The automaker now has more than 1,700 engineers, designers and researchers working on batteries and electric vehicles, many of them at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, where the company opened a dedicated battery research center in 2009, a week after it filed for bankruptcy reorganization.  Automotive experts say GM\u2019s battery and EV group is one of the largest in the world, rivaled only by Toyota Motor Corp in Japan and Daimler AG in Germany.  Toyota has patented more battery technology in recent years than GM, although its focus has been mainly the Prius family of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, rather than on pure battery-powered cars like GM\u2019s Bolt EV.  GM was issued 661 U.S. patents on battery technology from 2010 through 2015, the latest that such data is available from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, trailing only Toyota\u2019s 762 battery patents among global automakers.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2CHPWnx  In addition to the battery work, GM engineers are developing a new dedicated \u201cplug and play\u201d structure for its next-generation electric vehicles that is flexible and modular, meaning it will be able to accommodate battery systems of different sizes, as well as hydrogen fuel cells, one of the sources said.  In an interview, Mark Reuss, head of global product development, said GM\u2019s strategy to reduce battery cost is not tied to a single improvement such as a change in battery chemistry, but rather a series of continuous enhancements in battery technology and packaging.  \u201cThere are no silver bullets here,\u201d Reuss said. GM also has not solved all the problems required to achieve its goal, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018product development\u2019 for a reason,\u201d he said.  The most recent developments and enhancements in battery technology have not been made public, according to GM\u2019s Fletcher.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that we choose not to patent because we don\u2019t want to make it visible\u201d before the new technology goes into production, Fletcher told Reuters.  GM\u2019s patent history since 2010 shows a focus on improvements in battery technology, packaging and processing, some of them designed to help boost the battery\u2019s energy and extend vehicle range between charges, according to company filings.  GM jointly developed its current battery know-how with Korea\u2019s LG Group, which makes batteries and electronic components for the Bolt. Introduced in October 2016, Bolt was the first mass-produced electric vehicle to go more than 200 miles between charges, and sell at a sticker price of under $40,000. GM sold 23,297 Bolts in 2017.  Tesla reported producing just 1,770 of its $35,000 Model 3 sedans in 2017, well short of the company\u2019s original targets.  The launch of the Bolt and its warm reception by reviewers, customers and investors was a watershed event for Barra and GM\u2019s top management.  \u201cIt was a \u2018holy shit\u2019 moment that made us rethink what might be possible,\u201d said one GM insider.

          "body": "* Exports reach record levels in December  * Flows increase ahead of refinery maintenance in Mideast  By Ahmad Ghaddar and Ron Bousso  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Gasoline exports from Europe to the Middle East have surged in recent months to record highs as traders seek to fill a gap due to particularly heavy refinery maintenance in the region in the coming months, according to shipping data and trading sources.  So far this month, at least a dozen tankers have been confirmed or placed on subjects, a term used in the industry to denote a provisional booking for an oil tanker, to load the motor fuel in Europe in January with options for the owners of the cargo to deliver to the Middle East.  The ships could potentially move over 700,000 tonnes of gasoline along the route, near a record level achieved in December.  \u201cNovember\u2019s loadings bound for the Middle East almost tripled versus the month prior, reaching the highest on our records (since the start of 2014), before climbing even higher in December to just shy of 900,000 tonnes,\u201d said Matt Smith, an analyst for energy database Clipper Data.  Gasoline exports from Europe to the Middle East are fairly regular, but a heavy maintenance schedule in the Middle East, which holds some of the world\u2019s largest and most advanced refineries, has pushed up demand on the route over the past few months.  Lower gasoline refining margins and prices in recent months have helped open the arbitrage out of Europe, particularly as exports to the U.S. East Coast, traditionally the main market for European sellers, have dropped. <EUROBOB-ARA, BFO->  The Middle East is also a key exporter to Europe of middle distillates, such as diesel and jet fuel, although Europe is well supplied with these products at present.  \u201cThere is ... a substantial turnaround schedule planned in the Middle East, one of Europe\u2019s key sources of product imports,\u201d U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said in a note last week, adding that around 1 million barrels-per-day of refining capacity will go down in the region in early March.  One of the main shutdowns is the 400,000 bpd Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery Co (Samref) plant which is scheduled to shut for over seven weeks from March 10.  Europe produces more gasoline that it needs and is a major exporter of the motor fuel. Its key export markets are the United States, West Africa, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.  While European exports to the United States have languished in recent months due to an abundance of supplies there, sellers in Europe have been able to find a reprieve from strong demand in Nigeria and from the Middle East.

The Colombo Stock Index ended 0.2 percent weaker at 6,527.14. The bourse rose 2.3 percent last week, in its second straight weekly gain.  Turnover stood at 546.8 million rupees ($3.56 million) on Tuesday, less than last year\u2019s daily average of 915.3 million rupees.  Foreign investors net bought shares worth 205.5 million rupees on Tuesday, extending the net foreign inflow in this year to 2.2 billion rupees.

          "body": "MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A handful of Indian cities are gearing up to launch bike-sharing systems to ease traffic congestion and deadly air pollution, as urban populations surge and vehicles clog the streets.   Bike sharing systems in the southern city of Mysuru and the central city of Bhopal, both launched last June, have met with a tremendous response, officials say.   About half a dozen more cities, including Bengaluru, Pune and Bhubaneswar, are now drawing up similar plans, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI), a Washington D.C.-based research organization.  \u201cBike sharing is a viable option for Indian cities - we just need good quality bikes, dedicated lanes and a system that is efficient,\u201d said Chandramauli Shukla, chief executive of Bhopal Smart City Corporation.  The corporation implements the federally-funded Smart Cities program to improve services like internet connectivity and public transport in 100 cities across India.  With rising incomes and a large young population, passenger vehicle ownership in India has nearly tripled in the last decade, government data shows. Gridlock has become common and transit systems struggle to keep pace.  Vehicle emissions account for almost a third of air pollution in India, which has nearly half the world\u2019s 20 most polluted cities, according to the World Health Organization.  Some 2.5 million people in the country die every year due to pollution.  Mysuru, close to the technology hub of Bengaluru, was the first to introduce a bike-sharing program, with the state\u2019s chief minister riding a yellow Trin Trin bike at the launch.  Registered users can borrow any of 450 bikes from 48 docking stations for a nominal fee.   In Bhopal, users can register on their smartphones and unlock one of 500 bikes from 60 docking stations.   The city now has 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) of dedicated bike lanes, according to WRI, which provided technical expertise to the Bhopal Municipal Corporation on the bike-sharing system.  More than 25,000 people registered in the first few months, half of them women, said Amit Bhatt, director of transport at WRI India.  \u201cIn India, people look down on those who bike. So we had to show this is cool, with good quality bikes and a mobile app to register and unlock bikes\u201d he said.  \u201cBut the main priority is safety, with dedicated bike lanes. That has encouraged people to give it a go,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Officials must be careful not to repeat the mistakes of China, where unchecked growth of bike-sharing firms led to piles of discarded bikes clogging sidewalks, Bhatt added.

Asked if the stake in the giant oil field - now frozen by a Dutch court - could be foreclosed, Stati\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cThis is the expected course of action.  \u201cWe will aggressively pursue enforcement in all relevant jurisdictions until the Republic of Kazakhstan complies with its treaty commitment to the award.\u201d  Samruk-Kazyna, the sovereign wealth fund which holds half of Kazakhstan\u2019s 16.88 percent Kashagan stake through a Dutch company, said it was making \u201call necessary arrangements to protect its interest in accordance with the applicable procedure and will continue to vigorously defend its rights\u201d.  Samruk-Kazyna said in a statement the freeze had no effect on the day-to-day management of its stake in Kashagan and payments \u201csave for payment of dividends to Samruk-Kazyna\u201d.  Kazakhstan\u2019s sovereign dollar bonds fell across the curve on Tuesday.  Stati, his son Gabriel and two family-controlled companies have been involved in legal battles with the Kazakh government of President Nursultan Nazarbayev for several years. They invested in Kazakhstan\u2019s oil and gas industry and have asserted that they were subjected to harassment from the state aimed at forcing them to sell their investments cheaply.  They and two of their companies won an arbitration award of around $500 million in Sweden against the government. Kazakhstan denies the allegations, says the arbitration was won through fraud, and has countersued in several countries.  Stati\u2019s victories so far are a rare example of Western courts ordering large-scale freezes of sovereign fund assets, and such moves could alarm the managers of other funds in the $7 trillion industry.  Stati\u2019s press office said in a statement that he had secured \u201cattachments\u201d of other Kazakh assets, including Kazakhstan\u2019s stake in a Luxembourg-based company, Eurasian Resources Group, and trade receivables due Kazakhstan from some Luxembourg firms.  A Swedish court has also frozen shares in 33 Swedish public companies worth about $100 million owned by Kazakhstan, Stati said, adding Swedish bailiffs had already begun a foreclosure process on some shares.  Simon Quijano-Evans, emerging markets strategist at Legal & General Investment Management wrote in a note to clients that the saga \u201creally should raise alarm bells amongst all sovereign wealth funds and central banks globally about the assumed \u2018immunity\u2019 of their assets that are mainly held in \u2018safe-havens\u2019 such as US Treasuries, European Government bonds and the like.\u201d  Kashagan, operated by Eni, Total, Shell , ExxonMobil, Kazakh state firm KazMunayGaz , China\u2019s CNPC and Japan\u2019s Inpex, is Kazakhstan\u2019s biggest oil field.  Kazakhstan has refused to pay the Swedish arbitration award. In October it filed a civil racketeering lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., against the Statis and their two firms.  Last October, Bank of New York Mellon froze $22.6 billion in assets held by Kazakhstan\u2019s National Fund, another sovereign wealth fund, following a lawsuit by Stati.

The flames were forcing the South Korean Coast Guard\u2019s search and rescue team to stay as far as 3 miles (4.8 km) away from the tanker, two South Korean officials told Reuters.  The Chinese government said late on Tuesday it had not found a \u201clarge-scale\u201d oil leak, and the ultra light oil, known as condensate, was burning off or evaporating so quickly it would leave little residue - less than 1 percent - within five hours of a spill. That reduces the chances of a crude-style oil slick.  Still, condensate is highly volatile when exposed to air and water and concerns were growing the tanker could explode and sink while a flotilla of 13 search and rescue vessels comb a 900-square-nautical-mile (3,100 sq km) area for the crew.   The tanker Sanchi (IMO:9356608), run by Iran\u2019s top oil shipping operator, National Iranian Tanker Co, collided on Saturday with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050), carrying grain from the United States, about 160 nautical miles (300 km) off China\u2019s coast near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta.  The Sanchi was carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate to South Korea, equivalent to about 1 million barrels and worth about $60 million.  Chinese state media CCTV showed footage on Monday of boats dousing the flames with water as plumes of thick dark smoke continued to billow from the tanker.   The size of the oil spill from the ship and the extent of the environmental harm were not known, but the disaster has the potential to be the worst since 1991 when 260,000 tonnes of oil leaked off the Angolan coast.  \u201cWe can\u2019t grasp the level of oil contamination at this moment. The cargo is still on fire, so it is hard to figure out if oil is being spilled,\u201d Park Sung-dong, an official from South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, told Reuters.  The body of a crew member was found on Monday in the water near the tanker, China\u2019s transport ministry said. It had been handed over to the civil affairs bureau.  The crew of the Sanchi are all Iranian nationals except for two Bangladeshi citizens.   Satellite imagery of the ship showed the blaze has weakened since the weekend, although the strong winds are dragging the tanker away from the Chinese coast, according to Greenpeace.  Between Sunday and Monday, the floating inferno traveled some 50 kilometers (31 miles) south east, according to Rashid Kang, campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia.  Another major concern is damage to the region\u2019s rich fish reserves. The Zhoushan fishing ground where the crash occurred is known as one of the biggest in the East China Sea, particularly for mackerel and croaker, according to Greenpeace.  The CF Crystal suffered limited damage and the 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, were rescued by a passing fishing trawler on Saturday night, according to a report posted by state-owned Xinhua News to its Twitter account on Tuesday.  \u201cThe fire was so fierce. It kept exploding like bombs. So loud,\u201d said Zhu Tingwen, a sailor on the fishing boat.  The trawler from Zhejiang province scoured for survivors on the tanker, but could not get close enough because of the fire, Xinhua said.  \u201cAnyone will go for a rescue in this case,\u201d said the fishing boat captain Zheng Lei. \u201cIt just happened to be me.\u201d  The freighter has been taken to a port near Shanghai where investigators will start work on assessing the cause of the disaster, the government said.   China\u2019s transport ministry warned toxic gas from the tanker was harmful to the rescue workers and that protective clothing and gas testing equipment was being dispatched to the emergency teams.          Trying to contain a spill of condensate, which is extremely low in density, highly toxic and much more explosive than normal crude oil, may be difficult.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to see a slick like with crude, but it\u2019s soluble, toxic and flammable, which is why we\u2019re seeing the fire. A lot of it is burning off or evaporating,\u201d said Greenpeace\u2019s Kang.

The European Union\u2019s statistics office Eurostat said the jobless rate in the 19 countries sharing the euro was 8.7 percent in November, down from 8.8 percent in October and the lowest since January 2009.  The number of unemployed fell by around 107,000 people to 14.263 million in the euro area, Eurostat said.  Emerging from years of economic malaise caused by the sovereign debt crisis, the euro zone economy is now growing strongest pace in a decade - at 2.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2017.  But the average unemployment rate for the whole single currency area masks great differences within it \u2014 Germany has an unemployment rate of 3.6 percent while Greece\u2019s was at 20.5 percent in September, Spain\u2019s was at 16.7 percent in November and Italy\u2019s was 11.0 percent.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is expected to choose a new central bank chief this year to succeed Canadian Mark Carney, who will step down in June 2019, three months after the country\u2019s scheduled exit from the European Union.  Following is a summary of possible contenders to run the Bank of England (BoE), which oversees the world\u2019s sixth-biggest economy and Britain\u2019s huge finance industry. No one has yet thrown their hat into the ring.  ANDREW BAILEY - the outsider insider  Widely tipped by analysts as Carney\u2019s most likely successor, Bailey reached the role of deputy governor of the BoE with a focus on banks before becoming chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, a financial markets regulator.  During his time at the BoE, Bailey helped to steer Britain\u2019s banks through the global financial crisis, enhancing his reputation as a safe pair of hands.  However, heading the FCA - which roots out misconduct in Britain\u2019s large financial services sector - is fraught with risks. The head of the British parliament\u2019s influential Treasury Committee has criticised Bailey for withholding parts of a report into alleged misconduct by state-owned RBS during the financial crisis. Bailey has cited privacy restrictions.  As FCA boss, Bailey sits on important panels at the BoE that oversee banks. Although he has never been interest-rate setter, he once ran the BoE international economic analysis team.  Bailey acknowledged the speculation about a move to the BoE in an interview published this week. \u201cYou\u2019ll be unsurprised to know this question comes up reasonably often,\u201d Bailey told Financial News. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a job and, I have to be honest with you, I have never spent my time thinking about the one I want to do next.\u201d      BEN BROADBENT AND DAVE RAMSDEN - the deputies   Broadbent and Ramsden are deputy governors for monetary policy and for markets and banking respectively, burnishing their credentials as potential successors to Carney.   Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist who once trained as a classical pianist, is respected for his economic analysis but has less experience on banking oversight, which has become an important part of the BoE governor\u2019s role.  Ramsden only joined the central bank in September although he is no stranger to the Monetary Policy Committee having attended 92 of its meetings in his previous role as the Treasury\u2019s chief economic advisor.  The two other BoE deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods, are less likely contenders. Woods focuses mostly on bank regulation while Cunliffe - a former British ambassador to the EU - would be aged 66 at the start of the term which usually runs for eight years, although Carney has chosen to step down after six.  ANDY HALDANE - the free thinker  The BoE\u2019s chief economist, Haldane has developed a reputation for floating unconventional ideas, including the abolition of cash as a way to give central banks more muscle over the economies they run. In 2012, he praised the anti-capitalist Occupy movement for suggesting new ways to fix the shortcomings of global finance. Haldane has experience of both sides of the Bank, having served previously as executive director for financial stability, overseeing the risks to the economy from the banking system. But he might be seen as too much of a maverick to take the job of governor.  The announcement of Carney, the first non-British governor of the BoE in more than three centuries, was a surprise. Should finance minister Philip Hammond also opt for a less obvious candidate, one name that has appeared in Britain\u2019s media is that of Sharon White, the head of a telecoms regulator and who previously worked at the Treasury. The daughter of Jamaican immigrants, she has won wide praise for her high-profile roles in the public sector. Another outside contender would be Adair Turner, a former chairman of a now defunct financial services regulator who was in the running last time around. He continues to speak about the British economy and has warned of the risks from high debt levels.      The prospect of the left-wing Labour Party taking power in the next year or so is remote but investors are mindful that Prime Minister Theresa May has only a small majority in parliament after last year\u2019s failed election gamble and her Conservative Party is split over how to leave the European Union. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his would-be finance minister John McDonnell are socialists and have in the past proposed that the BoE should fund investment in infrastructure, a big change from its current focus on inflation. If they were to pick the next BoE governor, Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment strategist at Tilney Group, an investment firm, said they might consider former members of an economic advisory committee which included U.S. academic and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and Ann Pettifor, a British economist who is an austerity critic.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The author of the satirical memoir \u201cHow to Lose Friends and Alienate People\u201d became the latest figure to embarrass British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday, resigning from a watchdog for British universities over a history of misogynist tweets.  Toby Young quit his post on the board of the Office for Students, which is meant to help uphold standards in higher education, less than two days after May said he could keep it.  His resignation came amid a cabinet reshuffle meant to stamp May\u2019s authority on the government but derided in newspapers as a shambles, after one senior minister quit rather than take a new job and another talked May out of changing his role.  Young, whose memoir of a failed stint as a showbiz reporter was made into a 2008 movie, had reinvented himself as an education reform advocate, helping found a school in London run by parents under a program introduced by May\u2019s Conservatives.  But his appointment to the universities body was met by a barrage of criticism because of a history of sexist and inappropriate remarks in articles and on social media. A petition calling for his dismissal gathered more than 220,000 signatures.  In 2012, he criticized the \u201cghastly\u201d need for schools to meet accessibility requirements for the disabled. He has also said women who \u201cdisplay a lot of cleavage shouldn\u2019t then complain when men notice them\u201d, described himself as a self-confessed pornography addict, and joked about being sexually aroused by images of hungry African children.   He has apologized for such comments, which he said dated to a career as a \u201cjournalistic provocateur\u201d and did not reflect his commitment to education.  \u201cMy appointment has become a distraction from (the Office for Students\u2019) vital work of broadening access to higher education and defending academic freedom,\u201d Young said in a statement on the website of the Spectator magazine.  Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of parliament\u2019s education committee, told BBC radio on Tuesday that Young\u2019s appointment had been a mistake. His appointment \u201chadn\u2019t possibly been considered with due diligence and I thought it was the wrong decision\u201d, Halfon said.  On Sunday, May said Young should be allowed to continue serving even though she condemned offensive comments he had made in the past. But the issue had damaged her attempts to rebrand her Conservative party as more inclusive during the ministerial reshuffle, which began on Monday and is aimed at promoting more women, black and younger lawmakers.  The reshuffle was triggered by the resignation of May\u2019s top ally in the cabinet, Damian Green, who was forced to quit after giving misleading statements about pornography on his laptop.  May, who lost her majority in parliament last year after calling a snap election that she expected to win in a landslide, has struggled to restore her authority over a party divided between supporters and opponents of a hard break with the EU.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The author of the satirical memoir \u201cHow to Lose Friends and Alienate People\u201d became the latest figure to embarrass British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday, resigning from a watchdog for British universities over a history of misogynist tweets.  Toby Young quit his post on the board of the Office for Students, which is meant to help uphold standards in higher education, less than two days after May said he could keep it.  His resignation came amid a cabinet reshuffle meant to stamp May\u2019s authority on the government but derided in newspapers as a shambles, after one senior minister quit rather than take a new job and another talked May out of changing his role.  Young, whose memoir of a failed stint as a showbiz reporter was made into a 2008 movie, had reinvented himself as an education reform advocate, helping found a school in London run by parents under a program introduced by May\u2019s Conservatives.  But his appointment to the universities body was met by a barrage of criticism because of a history of sexist and inappropriate remarks in articles and on social media. A petition calling for his dismissal gathered more than 220,000 signatures.  In 2012, he criticized the \u201cghastly\u201d need for schools to meet accessibility requirements for the disabled. He has also said women who \u201cdisplay a lot of cleavage shouldn\u2019t then complain when men notice them\u201d, described himself as a self-confessed pornography addict, and joked about being sexually aroused by images of hungry African children.   He has apologized for such comments, which he said dated to a career as a \u201cjournalistic provocateur\u201d and did not reflect his commitment to education.  \u201cMy appointment has become a distraction from (the Office for Students\u2019) vital work of broadening access to higher education and defending academic freedom,\u201d Young said in a statement on the website of the Spectator magazine.  Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of parliament\u2019s education committee, told BBC radio on Tuesday that Young\u2019s appointment had been a mistake. His appointment \u201chadn\u2019t possibly been considered with due diligence and I thought it was the wrong decision\u201d, Halfon said.  On Sunday, May said Young should be allowed to continue serving even though she condemned offensive comments he had made in the past. But the issue had damaged her attempts to rebrand her Conservative party as more inclusive during the ministerial reshuffle, which began on Monday and is aimed at promoting more women, black and younger lawmakers.  The reshuffle was triggered by the resignation of May\u2019s top ally in the cabinet, Damian Green, who was forced to quit after giving misleading statements about pornography on his laptop.  May, who lost her majority in parliament last year after calling a snap election that she expected to win in a landslide, has struggled to restore her authority over a party divided between supporters and opponents of a hard break with the EU.

          "body": "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)  By Jamie McGeever  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. and UK interest rates are rising, the European Central Bank is cutting back its bond purchases and even the Bank of Japan is hinting it will turn off the stimulus taps one day.  With rates rising and central banks no longer expanding their balance sheets, monetary policy around the world will tighten more in 2018 than any year since the crisis.  Yet the real cost of borrowing, taking inflation into account, remains low historically and perhaps dangerously low. Real interest rates across the developed world have been negative since October 2016, and look set to remain so for some time.  This is music to investors\u2019 ears. Negative real rates and yields play a huge part in keeping broader financial conditions loose, which in turn is powering the \u201cmelt up\u201d in financial assets.  According to Goldman Sachs, financial conditions in the United States are looser now than when the Federal Reserve started raising rates in December 2015.  Despite the Fed\u2019s five rate hikes in the last two years, real U.S. interest rates remain negative. Depending on which measure of inflation you use, real rates are as low as -0.5 percent.  Countrary to the popular perception, Japanese real rates are the highest of all G4 central banks, while real 10-year bond yields in Britain are around the lowest they\u2019ve been for six years.  Negative real borrowing costs add fuel to markets that are already on fire, limiting the downward pressure on bonds, keeping corporate spreads on the tight side and pushing stocks to new high after new high.  But when compared with real yields, stocks aren\u2019t \u201cparticularly expensive\u201d, according to the Bank for International Settlements. The slump in real yields since the crisis means the S&P 500\u2019s near 2.5 percent dividend yield remains tempting to investors.  Exchange rates should also be viewed through the prism of real, not nominal, rates and yields. They help explain why the yen has held up well despite the BOJ\u2019s aggressive easing and why sterling is still down more than 10 percent since the 2016 Brexit referendum even though UK rates are rising.  The problem with negative real rates at this current juncture is obvious - the world economy and financial markets are booming. Is that an environment that warrants negative interest rates?  Asset price inflation is everywhere but consumer price inflation is pretty much nowhere to be seen, which is why central banks feel comfortable tightening policy so slowly.  Even though the global economy is roaring, scars from 2007-09 still run deep, and there\u2019s a clear inclination among policymakers to go slowly and gradually with any rate hikes.  This understandable caution is reinforced by the rapid rise in global debt. According to the Institute of International Finance, global debt now exceeds $230 trillion, higher than it was before the crisis and a new all-time high.  Rising debt necessitates lower real borrowing costs for consumers to sustain consumption and living standards. But higher interest rates could make high debt levels unsustainable.  For investors, it\u2019s a chicken and egg scenario. They\u2019re crying out for policy \u201cnormalization\u201d - higher rates and less central bank \u201cinterference\u201d in markets - but are enjoying the asset price boom that\u2019s in large part a direct consequence of central bank largesse.  It\u2019s clear that a corner has been turned, however, and that the global tightening shift is underway and some increase in real rates is expected, especially if strong growth continues. But it\u2019s hard to see them getting much above zero, especially in the euro zone and Britain.  While this remains the case, borrowing will continue to rise and the day of reckoning will inch closer. But as long as investors believe that day is far enough in the future distance, world markets may continue to boom.

          "body": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian rebels under siege near Damascus have resorted to talks with the government\u2019s ally Russia, sometimes meeting in no-man\u2019s land, as they seek to hang on to their enclave.  The meetings on eastern Ghouta - the only major rebel bastion around the capital - underline Moscow\u2019s deepening role in trying to shape Syria\u2019s future after the conflict, which broke out in 2011.  The rebels have won almost nothing from the negotiations so far, but they say they have little choice.  They believe the Russians, whose air force all but won the war for the government, will have the final say on Syria\u2019s fate.   The two main rebel forces in the suburbs signed ceasefires with Russia in the summer, but fighting has carried on. Both said they have been talking to Russian officials regularly for several months.  \u201cIt\u2019s better to negotiate with the one calling the shots, which is Russia, than with the regime,\u201d said Wael Olwan, spokesman for the Failaq al-Rahman insurgents. \u201cSo the factions are forced to sit down with them. This is the reality.\u201d  The Russian defense and foreign ministries did not respond to requests for comment on the talks. Moscow says the reconciliation center at its air base in Syria routinely holds peace talks with armed factions across the country.   The Syrian government\u2019s minister for national reconciliation has said the state intends to get all militants out of eastern Ghouta and restore its full control.   But the insurgents want their enemies to observe the truce, which they say includes lifting the siege, opening crossings, and letting dying patients out. It would also involve evacuating the few hundred fighters of al Qaeda\u2019s former Syria branch.   Both factions accuse Moscow of not honoring the deals, or turning a blind eye to Syrian army violations.  Damascus and Moscow say they only target militants.   \u201cWe send them documentation of how the aircraft drops missiles on residential areas,\u201d said Hamza Birqdar, a military spokesman for the Jaish al-Islam rebels.   \u201cEither there is silence ... or baseless excuses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say government authorities denied bombing. Then these planes flying over the Ghouta, who do they belong to?\u201d   (Graphic: Syria areas of control tmsnrt.rs/2xTrjp1)  The conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world\u2019s worst refugee crisis. Monitors and opposition activists blame Russian bombing for thousands of civilian deaths and much of the destruction - allegations Moscow denies.  After turning the war in favor of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia has seized the reins of international diplomacy in the past year. It has sought to build a political process outside of failed U.N. peace talks in Geneva.   Other countries including the United States, meanwhile, have wound down support for the array of mostly Sunni rebels.  Russian President Vladimir Putin, who first sent warplanes to help Assad in 2015, is pushing for a congress of national dialogue between Syria\u2019s many combatants.  With the map of Syria\u2019s conflict redrawn, Russia wants to convert military gains into a settlement that stabilizes the shattered nation and secures its interests in the region.   To this end, Moscow has been negotiating behind the scenes with armed factions across Syria.  \u201cWe communicate exclusively with them,\u201d said Birqdar. \u201cBecause in reality, when it comes to Assad and his government, they have become toys in the hands of the Russians. They make no decisions ... except under Russian orders.\u201d   With official and secret talks, Russia has built ties to local groups partly to gain influence on the ground, said Yury Barmin, an expert with the Russian International Affairs Council, a think-tank close to the foreign ministry.   \u201cThere\u2019s one goal. Their inclusion in the truce process,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this is done with the aim of populating these Russian processes, ones led by Russia, with such opposition groups.\u201d       Since 2013, Syrian government forces and their allies have blockaded eastern Ghouta, a densely populated pocket of satellite towns and farms.   The military has suppressed opposition enclaves across western Syria, with the help of Russian air power and Iran-backed Shi\u2019ite militias. Nearly seven years into the war, Assad has repeatedly vowed to take back every inch of Syria.   The Ghouta remains the only big rebel enclave near the heavily fortified capital.   \u201cOur communications with the Russian side are through (their) official in Damascus in charge of this file, by phone and in meetings,\u201d said Yasser Delwan, a local Jaish al-Islam political official.   They meet Russian forces in no-man\u2019s land, the abandoned farmland between rebel and government territory, at the edge of the nearby Wafideen camp.  \u201cWe talk about the deal we signed ... implementing it from paper into something practical,\u201d he said.   Both rebel forces said Russia instigated the talks. They said Russian officials sometimes blame Iran-backed forces for breaking the truce or use jihadists as a pretext for attacks against the Ghouta.  Failaq al-Rahman only negotiates with Russian officials outside Syria, said Olwan, their spokesman.  \u201cIn reality, Russia has never been honest in its support of the political track,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the failure of the international community ... the factions were forced to negotiate with the enemy.\u201d  DE-ESCALATION DEALS   Eastern Ghouta falls under ceasefire plans for rebel territory that Russia has brokered across Syria in the past year, with help from Turkey and Iran.   When the insurgents signed the \u201cde-escalation\u201d deal with Russia last summer, residents and aid workers hoped food would flow into the suburbs, home to around 400,000 people. But they say it has brought no relief. [nL8N1OQ1ZD]   Despite lulls in air strikes, the siege got harsher. In some frontline districts, fierce battles rage on. Food, fuel, and medicine have dwindled, especially after the shutdown of smuggling tunnels.     A Syrian official in Damascus said the army has only retaliated to militants in the suburbs shelling districts of the capital. \u201cAs for the Russian allies, every action takes place on Syrian land in full and total coordination with the Syrian government,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey have a big role.\u201d    The Ghouta\u2019s rebel factions, which have long been at odds, say they have no direct contacts with Assad\u2019s government.  \u201cIn its communications, Russia has always tried to present itself as the solution,\u201d Olwan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see them as mediators. We see them as the final commander in the regime\u2019s ranks.\u201d  The Damascus government mostly does not play a role in the talks, said Barmin, the Russia analyst. \u201cDamascus is presented with a fait accompli and must either accept it or not.\u201d  Additional reporting by Moscow bureau; Editing by Giles Elgood and Anna Willard"

          "body": "SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) will \u201cseriously consider\u201d listing in Hong Kong, founder Jack Ma said, potentially providing a powerful boost to the financial hub which is preparing to allow dual-class share listings.   Ma made the comments at an event in the city on Monday in response to remarks by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam about how she hoped Alibaba would consider returning to Hong Kong to list, an Alibaba spokeswoman said.   \u201cDaring to speak like this marks a strong commitment so we will definitely seriously consider the Hong Kong market,\u201d Ma said in response to Lam\u2019s speech, according to a transcript provided by Alibaba.  When asked by reporters about his comments after he met President Emmanuel Macron in Beijing on Tuesday, Ma said Alibaba was considering listing subsidiaries in Hong Kong, without elaborating. Macron is on the second leg of a three-day state visit in China.  The Alibaba spokeswoman said there were no further details available on what any Hong Kong listing plan could involve.  Alibaba held its record $25 billion public float in New York in 2014 after Hong Kong, its favored venue, refused to accept its governance structure where a self-selecting group of senior managers control the majority of board appointments.  Hong Kong is now set to allow dual-class shares under rule changes to be proposed by the city\u2019s stock exchange as it raises the stakes in its battle against New York for blockbuster Chinese initial public offerings.   Such shares grant differentiated voting rights and underpin the alternative governance and shareholding structures favored by many owners of new age industries such as technology.  Over $3 billion worth of Alibaba shares were traded on Monday, based on Reuters calculations using NASDAQ data. The stock closed at $190.33, with 16.23 million shares traded.   That compares with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd\u2019s (HKEX) (0388.HK) average daily securities turnover of HK$88.2 billion ($11.28 billion) in 2017.   Shares in HKEX, the city\u2019s exchange operator, rose as much as 3.1 percent to HK$270 on Tuesday, their highest level since July 2015.  Analysts said that an Alibaba listing in Hong Kong could help drive more funds from the mainland towards the city and could convince other big firms, in particular technology-related ones, to list in the financial hub.   \u201cIf the trading volume in Hong Kong is even better than that in the U.S., it will send out a signal to other new economy new listings that Hong Kong is a much better place for a listing than the U.S,\u201d said Steven Leung, sales director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.   For Alibaba, it could provide greater access to investors closer to China who are familiar with its business and allow it to benefit from the Hong Kong government\u2019s growing support for financial services innovation, said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific FinTech leader at consulting firm EY.  The HKEX said in December that it had begun drafting specific rule changes for allowing dual-class shares that will be put up for a formal public consultation in the first three months of 2018.  Under the planned rule changes, \u201cinnovative\u201d Chinese companies with a market capitalization over HK$10 billion and a primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or the London Stock Exchange would be able to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong. The HKEX has not yet defined what \u201cinnovative\u201d is.   \u201cWe are also creating a new route to secondary listings in Hong Kong to attract companies from emerging and innovative sectors. We are aware that many successful new economy companies already listed in the US and UK would benefit from these reforms,\u201d wrote Charles Li, chief executive of HKEX, in a blog post last month when the proposed changes were put forward.   Just 3 per cent of Hong Kong listings in the past decade, by market value, have been so-called \u201cnew economy\u201d companies, compared with 47 per cent for the New York Stock Exchange, according to a discussion paper published by the HKEX in June.  Some analysts said technical issues and underlying concerns about the dual-class structure still needed to be resolved and fine tuned.   \u201cThe main concern is about the protection to minority investors under the dual structure,\u201d said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities.

          "title": "UPDATE 1-With yuan stable, China c.bank loosens up on exchange rate mechanism - sources",
          "body": "* PBOC lets midpoint contributors adjust \u201cX\u201d factor - sources  * Easing yuan depreciation pressure a trigger for the move-sources  * Move seen not an intent to drastically weaken the yuan (Adds detail, context, quotes)  BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - China\u2019s central bank has taken a step to loosen control over the yuan exchange rate, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday, reflecting confidence that depreciation pressures on the Chinese currency have eased for now.  The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) effectively reduced the influence of the \u201ccounter-cyclical factor\u201d it introduced in May last year to the formula it uses to determine the mid-point reference rate for the yuan\u2019s exchange rate against the U.S. dollar each day. That factor was designed to lessen the impact of market forces on the yuan\u2019s reference point.  Sources said the PBOC had notified banks that contribute mid-point estimates to it for the official rate calculation that they could adjust the counter-cyclical factor by themselves, effectively allowing them to minimise its influence on their exchange rate contributions.  One source said this reflected the fact that the yuan was no longer under depreciation pressure.  In response to Reuters\u2019 request for information about the matter, the PBOC said it was up to the contributing banks to determine the counter-cyclical factor coefficient independently.  The formula the PBOC uses to determine the next day\u2019s midpoint fixing factors in the yuan settlement rate against the U.S. dollar at 4:30 p.m. (0830 GMT), along with changes in the trade-weighted basket of currencies and the counter-cyclical factor.  When it introduced that \u201cX\u201d factor, the PBOC said it would help to better reflect supply and demand, lessen possible \u201cherd effects\u201d in the market and guide the market to focus more on macroeconomic fundamentals.  But many traders saw it as a tool to reduce price swings and counteract pressure on the yuan after a rough 2016 when the Chinese currency lost about 6.5 percent against the dollar.  The yuan slipped after the news, finishing onshore trade at 6.5207 per dollar at 0830 GMT, weakening 0.34 percent from the previous late night close.  The offshore yuan was trading weaker at 6.5326 per dollar at 1056 GMT.  The yuan is allowed to trade within a band of two percent on either side of the daily midpoint.  The change could trigger further yuan weakening, said one currency trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai who forecast that it could test the 6.6 yuan, or renminbi, per dollar level.  Stephen Gallo, European head of FX Strategy at Bank of Montreal, said in a note he thinks this \u201cdoesn\u2019t drastically shift the balance of forces\u201d in the yuan-dollar exchange rate.  \u201cIf market forces will now be allowed to play a greater role in the level of the dollar-yuan mid-rate, the general downward trend in the U.S. dollar can presumably be transmitted through USDRMB more easily. Therefore, today\u2019s move doesn\u2019t signal an intent to drastically weaken the renminbi on the part of the PBOC,\u201d he wrote.  Analysts at Nomura also agreed it did not mean China wanted to allow the yuan to depreciate.  \u201cWe do not believe this is the goal and see the change as likely related to authorities allowing for greater FX flexibility,\u201d they said in a note.  \u201cIn our view, this means that, if CNY faces appreciation/depreciation pressures, it would likely translate into a greater move in the following day\u2019s fixing.\u201d  The yuan rose nearly 6.8 percent against the dollar in 2017, more than reversing the previous year\u2019s losses. Most of those gains were in the second half of the year after the introduction of the counter-cyclical factor as well as government efforts to plug outflows of capital and restore confidence in the yuan.

          "body": "MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A handful of Indian cities are gearing up to launch bike-sharing systems to ease traffic congestion and deadly air pollution, as urban populations surge and vehicles clog the streets.   Bike sharing systems in the southern city of Mysuru and the central city of Bhopal, both launched last June, have met with a tremendous response, officials say.   About half a dozen more cities, including Bengaluru, Pune and Bhubaneswar, are now drawing up similar plans, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI), a Washington D.C.-based research organization.  \u201cBike sharing is a viable option for Indian cities - we just need good quality bikes, dedicated lanes and a system that is efficient,\u201d said Chandramauli Shukla, chief executive of Bhopal Smart City Corporation.  The corporation implements the federally-funded Smart Cities program to improve services like internet connectivity and public transport in 100 cities across India.  With rising incomes and a large young population, passenger vehicle ownership in India has nearly tripled in the last decade, government data shows. Gridlock has become common and transit systems struggle to keep pace.  Vehicle emissions account for almost a third of air pollution in India, which has nearly half the world\u2019s 20 most polluted cities, according to the World Health Organization.  Some 2.5 million people in the country die every year due to pollution.  Mysuru, close to the technology hub of Bengaluru, was the first to introduce a bike-sharing program, with the state\u2019s chief minister riding a yellow Trin Trin bike at the launch.  Registered users can borrow any of 450 bikes from 48 docking stations for a nominal fee.   In Bhopal, users can register on their smartphones and unlock one of 500 bikes from 60 docking stations.   The city now has 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) of dedicated bike lanes, according to WRI, which provided technical expertise to the Bhopal Municipal Corporation on the bike-sharing system.  More than 25,000 people registered in the first few months, half of them women, said Amit Bhatt, director of transport at WRI India.  \u201cIn India, people look down on those who bike. So we had to show this is cool, with good quality bikes and a mobile app to register and unlock bikes\u201d he said.  \u201cBut the main priority is safety, with dedicated bike lanes. That has encouraged people to give it a go,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Officials must be careful not to repeat the mistakes of China, where unchecked growth of bike-sharing firms led to piles of discarded bikes clogging sidewalks, Bhatt added.

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) said it would likely rake in a record fourth-quarter profit but the guidance fell short of consensus estimate, spooking investors already worried that a memory chip boom could be ending sooner rather than later.  Shares of Samsung fell almost 4 percent as the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker became one of the first major semiconductor firms to indicate disappointing results could be on the radar at a time when NAND memory chip prices are easing.  Samsung pegged its October-December operating profit at 15.1 trillion won ($14.1 billion), an all-time high and up 64 percent from a year ago but shy of a 15.9 trillion won average estimate from 17 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. It estimated revenue at 66 trillion won, also slightly below expectations.  The Apple Inc (AAPL.O) smartphone rival did not elaborate on its performance. However, two analysts said a strong won and a year-end bonus for staff in the semiconductor business likely dented the South Korean firm\u2019s quarterly profit by about 400 billion won and 400-500 billion won, respectively.  Samsung shares ended down 3.1 percent, versus the broader market .KS11 that fell 0.1 percent and shares in rival SK Hynix (000660.KS) that fell 1.7 percent, amid worries over the outlook for smartphones and the so-called chip \"super-cycle\".   \u201cThe currency effect and bonuses appear to be the main reason for (Samsung) missing market forecasts, but smartphone shipments are also likely to be lower than expected,\u201d said Song Myung-sup, analyst at HI Investment & Securities.   \u201cConsidering Apple and Chinese firms\u2019 sales weren\u2019t stellar either, overall mobile demand appears to have been sluggish.\u201d  Samsung will disclose detailed results for the fourth quarter on Jan. 31.   The last time a Samsung guidance statement disappointed the market was in the wake of the embarrassing withdrawal of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 handsets in October 2016.   Based on the quarterly guidance, Samsung\u2019s 2017 operating profit is likely to come in at 53.6 trillion won, versus previous year\u2019s 29.2 trillion won.  \u201cWe see potential downside risk to component orders and smartphone sales beyond Q1,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Choi said in a note on Tuesday, adding the current consensus profit estimate for the first quarter may be adjusted.   Samsung likely benefited from higher DRAM chip prices in its latest quarter, analysts said.  But the outlook for semiconductors in 2018 is mixed. Samsung shares have fallen 12 percent from their all-time high in early November as some investors bet on an end to the memory boom.   NAND flash memory chips, used in things like digital cameras and USB drives, have entered a down-cycle and there is a view among some industry observers that DRAM market conditions also will soften later this year.   Others however expect DRAM supply to remain tight throughout 2018 as Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Facebook (FB.O) expand data centers used for cloud storage and computing.   The outlook for smartphones and other mobile devices, which analysts expect to contribute about 17 percent to Samsung\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings, is also uncertain due to competition from Chinese rivals in markets like Europe and Asia.  Tom Kang, research director at data provider Counterpoint, said Samsung\u2019s mobile division should show \u201cmoderate\u201d shipment growth of about 1-2 percent in 2018.   South Korean exporters like Samsung will be keeping a close eye on the won KRW=KFTC in 2018. The currency traded on Monday at its highest in more than three years.

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Industrial production and exports from Germany rose more than expected in November, prompting the government to raise its estimate of growth for 2017 and signaling that its expansion would carry on this year.  Industrial output jumped 3.4 percent for the month, the biggest increase since September 2009, the Federal Statistics Office reported on Tuesday, overshooting a 1.8 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.  Seasonally adjusted exports for November rose 4.1 percent on the month and domestic demand pushed imports up 2.3 percent. Both figures beat Reuters forecasts, and they widened the trade surplus to 22.3 billion euros ($26.61 billion) from 19.9 billion euros in October.  The figures and buoyant business sentiments suggest \u201cthat the German economy ended 2017 with a bang after the third quarter\u2019s impressive 0.8 percent expansion,\u201d Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics wrote in a note.  Soon after the data, the government raised its 2017 growth forecast to 2.2 percent from a previous estimate of 2.0 percent.  \u201cThe economy is stable,\u201d Deputy Economy Minister Matthias Machnig said. \u201cAnd we assume that it will continue at about the same level.\u201d  The economy has expanded every year for the past eight years, and it has continued to surge even though Chancellor Angela Merkel has failed to form a new coalition government after September\u2019s national election, creating a political deadlock.   The rise in November\u2019s output confirmed economists\u2019 assumption that a 1.2 percent drop in October was caused by limited factors, namely two public holidays.  A breakdown of the output data showed the main drivers were capital and consumer goods spending as well as construction.      The Statistics Office will publish on Thursday full-year gross domestic product figures for 2017, which are forecast to show 2.4 percent growth. Some analysts expect it to do better.  \u201cGerman GDP looks set to have risen by slightly more than our above-consensus forecast of 2.5 percent in 2017 and we expect a similarly strong pace of growth this year,\u201d McKeown said.

          "body": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Tuesday the Syrian army was striking moderate opposition forces in Idlib province and this was undermining efforts to reach a political solution to the war in Syria.  Turkey has been fiercely opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during his country\u2019s six-year-old civil war but has recently been working with his allies Russia and Iran for a political resolution to the conflict.  The three countries agreed last year to establish a \u201cde-escalation zone\u201d in the opposition-held Idlib province and surrounding region, which borders Turkey, but Syrian forces have since launched an offensive in the area.    \u201cRegime forces are hitting the moderate opposition with the excuse that they are fighting Nusra (Islamist militants). This attitude scuppers the political solution process,\u201d state-run Anadolu news agency quoted Cavusoglu as telling reporters.   \u201cThe groups who will come together in Sochi should not do this,\u201d he said, referring to the Russian city where a Syrian congress of national dialogue is set to be held at the end of this month.  The main rebel force in the northwestern province of Idlib is Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria that was known as Nusra Front.    A Turkish security source said Ankara was watching developments in northern Syria closely but added that the areas that the Syrian army had recaptured lay \u201cmostly outside the de-escalation zones\u201d.   Turkey says it has deployed troops to observation points in northern Idlib province, about 60 km (40 miles) north of the Syrian army offensive.  While Ankara has toned down its criticism of Assad since it started cooperating with Russia, President Tayyip Erdogan last month called Assad a terrorist and said it was impossible for Syrian peace efforts to continue with him.

          "body": "MANILA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of devotees in the Philippines, many of them barefooted, joined a chaotic procession on Tuesday that featured a black statue of Jesus Christ, one of the biggest annual festivals in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation.  The faithful gathered in downtown Manila to follow a carriage bearing the statue called the Black Nazarene, believed to have healing powers, in a parade that began at dawn and may last until evening or even longer.  Some of them jostled and climbed onto the carriage as it was pushed and pulled by dozens of men holding ropes, while the crowd waved towels and handkerchiefs in a sign of praise to the kneeling life-sized image that carried a cross on one shoulder.   Processions and other religious rites were also held elsewhere in the country of 105 million people to celebrate the feast.  Citing police estimates, media said this year\u2019s festivities may draw 17 million devotees nationwide, some seeking healing for illnesses and forgiveness for sins and others offering thanks for blessings.  Rogelio Lim said all his wishes had come true since he became a Black Nazarene devotee in 1977.  \u201cMy child is now a medicine graduate,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cI have been spared diseases. I have been blessed with a house. Everything we wished for. A good job. Everything. This is why I am here, to thank Him.\u201d  The Philippine Red Cross said it had assisted more than 700 devotees who were feeling unwell, or suffered injuries amid the parade\u2019s growing crowds, many of whom clamored to reach toward the icon.  Alvin Carlos said he felt stronger after touching the Black Nazarene.  \u201cRain or shine, I gained the strength to continue because of my strong faith in Him,\u201d he said.  More than 4,000 police and soldiers were deployed to ensure the Manila procession would be peaceful, said Oscar Albayalde, the capital\u2019s police chief.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The UK\u2019s top share index came within a whisker of a record high on Tuesday as Morrisons led a buoyant retail sector on the back of a well-received Christmas trading update.      Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 .FTSE index was up 0.3 percent at 7,720.19 points by 0955 GMT, while mid caps gained 0.1 percent.  Shares in Morrisons (MRW.L) were among the best performers on the FTSE, up 2.6 percent after the supermarket chain beat sales expectations in the all-important Christmas trading period.  This boded well for other British food retailers, as shares in peers Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) and Sainsbury (SBRY.L) also rose 3.3 percent and 1.3 percent respectively.  \u201cThe Morrisons update is clearly better than expected,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.  \u201cMarks has got the double benefit of both food and clothing and houseware. Next gave a good update from the clothing and the houseware section, Morrisons is giving a good update for the grocery, so perhaps Marks can benefit twofold there,\u201d van Dulken added, referring to Next\u2019s upbeat Christmas update last week.   Sainsbury, Tesco (TSCO.L) and Marks & Spencer are all due to give updates on Christmas trading this week.  Concerns over how UK retailers have fared over the holiday season were raised after Debenhams (DEB.L) and Mothercare (MTC.L) saw sharp share price drops following their updates.  Industry figures showed that shoppers feeling the pinch from inflation scaled back on almost everything except for food in the last three months of 2017.  This has led to the biggest fall in non-grocery spending since 2009.  \u201cFood sales have managed to shrug off the consumer slowdown, after all, eating three meals a day is more important than having the very latest iPhone,\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note.  Elsewhere, shares in Persimmon (PSN.L) declined 1.6 percent after its trading update, with the housebuilder saying that it was hoping to achieve a modest increase in sales this year.  Shares in Micro Focus (MCRO.L), which dropped nearly 17 percent in the previous session thanks to a weak set of results and disappointing outlook, recovered slightly and were up 1.8 percent.  Analysts at Barclays said that the fall in Micro Focus was so harsh it was hard to justify.  \u201cWe would look through the volatility in trading and use this as an opportunity,\u201d they said in a note.

External factors have also proved supportive for the pound with the U.S. dollar struggling to gain much traction against its rivals in the opening days of the year. \u201cWe expect to see progress towards securing a transitional deal (on leaving the European Union) in the coming months and that should be constructive for sterling,\u201d said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at MUFJ in London. He expects the pound to rise to 1.40 against the dollar over the next six months.  On Tuesday, sterling edged 0.3 percent lower to $1.3529 but remained within striking distance of a four-month high of $1.3614 hit last week.  Against the euro, it has been a more mixed picture, with sterling oscillating around the 88 cents line over the last month.  Net long bets on sterling are near their highest levels in more than three years, according to data released by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday, suggesting some investors have warmed to the bullish sterling theme.  That optimism has also filtered through to the currency derivatives markets, with gauges of expected volatility plummeting to more than three-year lows.  The drop in expected price swings has gathered steam since Prime Minister Theresa May secured progress in the complicated process of leaving the EU last month \u2014 so much so that expected volatility in sterling in options with up to one-year maturities is now below even some major rivals, such as the Japanese yen and the euro.  But some investors remain unconvinced that sterling is a buy, pointing to structural weaknesses of the British economy such as widening deficits.  \u201cWe remain underweight on the pound as we see the balance of payments on a deteriorating trend,\u201d said Alessio de Longis, portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds, which manages $235 billion in global assets.

The figure excludes thousands of new hires and job eliminations by attrition.

At least seven people have been arrested, including the mothers of two of the boys, on suspicion of violating child protection and pornography laws and could face up to 15 years in prison.   \u201cResults of the preliminary investigation show that the director sold the videos to someone in Russia and Canada,\u201d said regional police spokesman Yusri Yunus, adding that the motive of those involved was to make money.   \u201cWe are still investigating and coordinating with the national cyber crime unit.\u201d  The director received 31 million rupiah ($2,307) to make the videos, media have said.  Indonesia has been vulnerable to child pornography and sexual abuse of minors because of poverty and lax enforcement of laws in the past.  Authorities stopped 92 convicted Australian pedophiles from entering the country last year, based on immigration data.  In a case that shocked Southeast Asia, a British court handed Richard Huckle 22 life sentences in 2016 for abusing up to 200 babies and children, mostly in Malaysia, and sharing images of his crimes on the dark web.

Grace, whose efforts to take over the leadership of the ruling ZANU-PF party prompted a de facto military coup against her husband, then-president Robert Mugabe, in November, graduated in 2014, just months after she had registered to study at the University of Zimbabwe.  Up to now, her dissertation for the doctorate has not been published and is not available in the university library, as such academic qualifications usually are.  \u201cWe indeed received a report from the sociology department at the university on how Grace Mugabe received her doctorate and that is what we are investigating,\u201d said Goodson Nguni, the head of investigations at the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission.  Local media reports say the sociology department told the commission that Grace\u2019s doctorate was \u201csuspicious\u201d and needed to be investigated.  Grace, who was called \u201cDr Amai\u201d - or \u201clearned mother of the nation\u201d -  by adulating followers, has previously defended her academic record and last September told a ZANU-PF rally that she had earned her doctorate even though her detractors thought otherwise.  Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was on the receiving end of vicious attacks by Grace last year, succeeded 93-year-old Mugabe as president in November.  Grace has not appeared in public since Nov. 15, when army  tanks rolled into the capital and confined Mugabe and his family at his luxurious mansion in Harare.

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Automakers in China face their weakest year of sales growth in at least two decades as a phasing out of tax cuts on smaller engine cars that began in 2017 looks set to further dampen customer demand in the world\u2019s largest car market.   The incentive roll back is having a bigger than expected impact, with China\u2019s automotive manufacturers association expecting auto sales to grow around 3.5 percent in 2017, missing earlier forecasts. They are predicting 3 percent sales growth for this year, according to state media. [nB9N1O700I]  Its impact was reflected in 2017 China vehicle sales numbers for several global automakers.   General Motors Co (GM.N) said last week that its China sales grew 4.4 percent last year, following a 7.1 percent rise in 2016, while Ford (F.N) said on Tuesday that its sales fell 6 percent after a 11.9 percent rise in 2016. [nB9N1OJ01X][nB9N1OT00X]  Toyota Motor Corp\u2019s (7203.T) sales growth slowed in 2017 compared to 2016. South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) and Kia Motors (000270.KS) have cited the tax roll back as a reason for lower 2017 sales. [nB9N1OT00L] [nL4N1OW1CE]  \u201c2018 will start weak - we are projecting basically another flat year in light vehicle sales...The big question is does the government step in with some tax breaks, incentives to keep things rolling?,\u201d said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief of consultancy IHS Markit Automotive.   \u201cI believe you\u2019d have to go sometime before the year 2000,\u201d he said, when asked when was the last time the market posted flat growth. Two other analysts said annual growth has not been 3 percent or lower in this century.   Beijing last year began raising the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 liters or less to 7.5 percent this year from a special rate of 5 percent last year, a policy that it originally launched to shore up sales in a weakening economy. It plans to return the rate to 10 percent in 2018.  Such a sales backdrop meant that competition on the ground, especially in the mid-to-high end sector, would stiffen, requiring car makers to respond more quickly to consumers\u2019 changing desires, something analysts said local and some Japanese brands could be nimbler at.   China\u2019s Geely Automobile Holdings (0175.HK), owner of the Volvo car brand, said on Tuesday that its 2017 net profit had doubled year-on-year, citing a \u201csignificant increase in sales revenue\u201d. [nFWN1P406R]  Further challenges will come from strict production and sales quotas for new-energy vehicles (NEV) that Beijing wants automakers to implement by 2019.

          "body": "* Yen rises after Bank of Japan trims JGB purchases  * Crude oil futures rise to highest since May 2015  * Samsung\u2019s guidance disappoints, weighing on tech sector  * Nikkei probes highest levels since November 1991  * Europe helps world stocks extend flying start to year  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Marc Jones  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - A tweak to the Bank of Japan\u2019s bond-buying programme caused the yen to rise on Tuesday, while gains from commodity stocks as oil hit its highest since 2015 helped world shares maintain their flying start to the year.  MSCI\u2019s all-country world stocks index posted another record high as Europe\u2019s main markets shrugged off a tech wobble in Asia and instead cheered Christmas trading updates and more forecast-beating data from Germany.  The yen rose as much as half a percent to 112.50 yen to the dollar after Japan\u2019s central bank trimmed its purchases of long-dated government bonds, stoking speculation it could start to wind down its stimulus policy this year.  Since it adopted its yield-curve-control policy in 2016, the BoJ has occasionally tweaked its buying, but some market players seemed to take Tuesday\u2019s move as a signal.  \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be perceived as a monstrous signal of the end of monetary easing but it shows that even the tiniest announcement on a quiet day can have a reaction,\u201d said Societe Generale\u2019s global head of currency strategy Kit Juckes.  \u201cAnd it shows that when they start turning their ship around from this policy, the yen is going to go miles.\u201d  The dollar, meanwhile, was rising against most other major currencies.  The euro - which last week approached three-year highs - slipped further away from $1.20 to a 10-day low of $1.1941 .  That was despite the biggest increase in German industrial data since September 2009 and suggested investors were becoming more cautious after a rally that has pushed \u201clong\u201d euro positions to records.  \u201cI don\u2019t think right now levels substantially above $1.20 are justified,\u201d Reichelt said. \u201cI know the market is very optimistic about the euro, but if you look at the data and the central bank, the ECB (European Central Bank) is still on an expansionary path.\u201d  Nevertheless, euro zone bond yields rose, with traders also making room for new supply from three of the bloc\u2019s best-rated countries at relatively attractive levels.  The yield on the region\u2019s benchmark, German 10-year debt, climbed to 0.44 percent, well above the mid-December level of 0.30 percent.  In the major commodity markets, the focus remained on oil. U.S. crude prices hit their highest since 2015 on Tuesday amid OPEC-led production cuts and a dip in American drilling.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.16 a barrel at 0951 GMT - 43 cents, or 0.7 percent, above their last settlement. They earlier matched a May 2015 high of $62.56 a barrel.  Beyond equalling that 2015 high, which was a short intra-day spike, Tuesday\u2019s high was the strongest for WTI since December, 2014, at the start of the oil market slump.  \u201cSpeculators continued to increase their net long in ICE Brent ... According to exchange data, speculators increased their position by 4,175 lots to leave them with a record net long of 565,459 lots,\u201d ING bank said.  Brent crude futures were at $68.11 a barrel, 33 cents, or 0.5 percent, above their last close. Brent touched $68.27 last week, its highest since May 2015.  Asian trading saw Japan\u2019s Nikkei close at its highest since November 1991, catching up to the previous session\u2019s gains as markets reopened after a holiday on Monday.  South Korea\u2019s share market erased its gains and slipped 0.1 percent, dragged lower by a 3.1 percent drop in shares of Samsung Electronics Co.  Samsung\u2019s guidance fell short of market expectations despite a forecast for a record fourth-quarter profit, as a strong won and one-off staff bonuses offset surging DRAM prices.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Angola\u2019s kwanza currency was marked lower on Tuesday ahead of an expected devaluation, while broader emerging assets also weakened, with stocks slipping off 6-1/2-year highs.  MSCI\u2019s benchmark emerging equities index kicked off 2018 by extending last year\u2019s strong performance, underpinned by encouraging growth data in both emerging and developed markets and strong fund inflows.  But the index snapped a five-day run of gains, falling 0.2 percent after a decline in South Korea where shares in Samsung Electronics fell more than 3 percent on disappointing earnings guidance.  South Africa\u2019s stricken retailer Steinhoff saw shares tumble another 9 percent after the European Central Bank apparently sold the dual-listed firm\u2019s bonds.  Turkish shares lost around half a percent, led down by banks which reacted negatively to belligerent comments by President Tayyip Erdogan describing the U.S. trial of a Turkish banker as \u201ca political coup attempt\u201d .  With most emerging currencies weaker against a stronger dollar, Angola was set to become the latest country to ditch its dollar peg. The kwanza was marked 0.8 percent lower before a forex auction due to be held under new rules.  The currency is pegged at around 165 per dollar but trades on the black market at around 400. Authorities are expected to allow the kwanza to float in a target band.  Regis Chatellier, a strategist at Societe Generale, said the reform would be positive for Angola but was sceptical on how free floating the kwanza would actually be.  \u201cWith these countries, there are always a lot of good intentions. We saw that with Nigeria for example, the currency was floating or at least it was supposed to be that way, but the bottom line was it was not floating as much as people wanted. We could have a similar issue here,\u201d he said.  Johannesburg-based brokerage NKC suggested the currency could overshoot to the downside if markets perceive the new rates as still overvalued.  \u201cTo maintain credibility ...(the central bank) would then need to inject foreign exchange into the system. However, (authorities\u2019) ability to defend the unit is constrained by the low level of foreign reserves,\u201d NKC wrote.  Another currency in focus was Romania\u2019s leu which slipped to one-week lows against the euro, after interest rates rose on Monday for the first time in a decade. The central bank also signalled comfort with greater currency swings.  Inflation is now above-forecast and data showed a sharply wider trade balance.  JPMorgan told clients Romania\u2019s rate rise had come too late and would likely be followed up by another 125 bps hike this year. It suggested an underweight position in the leu and local bonds.  \u201cImbalances should set leu on a depreciation path in contrast to other central banks, where the cyclical upswing should lead to currency gains,\u201d the bank said. \u201cWe continue to see (government bonds) as offering too little risk premium compared to the inflation outlook and fiscal challenges.\u201d  Kazakhstan\u2019s tenge and dollar bonds weakened slightly after news Moldovan businessman Anatolie Stati said he would ask bailiffs to sell a $5.2 billion stake in the Kashagan oil field owned by Kazakh sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna if Astana refuses to pay an arbitration award.  Last October, $22.6 billion in assets held by Kazakhstan\u2019s National Fund were also frozen, following a lawsuit by Stati.  \u201c(The freeze) really should raise alarm bells amongst all sovereign wealth funds and central banks globally about the assumed immunity\u2019 of their assets that are mainly held in \u2018safe havens\u2019 such as U.S. Treasuries,\u201d Legal & General Investment Management\u2019s Simon Quijano-Evans told clients.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The UK\u2019s top share index came within a whisker of a record high on Tuesday as Morrisons led a buoyant retail sector on the back of a well-received Christmas trading update.      Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 .FTSE index was up 0.3 percent at 7,720.19 points by 0955 GMT, while mid caps gained 0.1 percent.  Shares in Morrisons (MRW.L) were among the best performers on the FTSE, up 2.6 percent after the supermarket chain beat sales expectations in the all-important Christmas trading period.  This boded well for other British food retailers, as shares in peers Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) and Sainsbury (SBRY.L) also rose 3.3 percent and 1.3 percent respectively.  \u201cThe Morrisons update is clearly better than expected,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.  \u201cMarks has got the double benefit of both food and clothing and houseware. Next gave a good update from the clothing and the houseware section, Morrisons is giving a good update for the grocery, so perhaps Marks can benefit twofold there,\u201d van Dulken added, referring to Next\u2019s upbeat Christmas update last week.   Sainsbury, Tesco (TSCO.L) and Marks & Spencer are all due to give updates on Christmas trading this week.  Concerns over how UK retailers have fared over the holiday season were raised after Debenhams (DEB.L) and Mothercare (MTC.L) saw sharp share price drops following their updates.  Industry figures showed that shoppers feeling the pinch from inflation scaled back on almost everything except for food in the last three months of 2017.  This has led to the biggest fall in non-grocery spending since 2009.  \u201cFood sales have managed to shrug off the consumer slowdown, after all, eating three meals a day is more important than having the very latest iPhone,\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note.  Elsewhere, shares in Persimmon (PSN.L) declined 1.6 percent after its trading update, with the housebuilder saying that it was hoping to achieve a modest increase in sales this year.  Shares in Micro Focus (MCRO.L), which dropped nearly 17 percent in the previous session thanks to a weak set of results and disappointing outlook, recovered slightly and were up 1.8 percent.  Analysts at Barclays said that the fall in Micro Focus was so harsh it was hard to justify.  \u201cWe would look through the volatility in trading and use this as an opportunity,\u201d they said in a note.

          "body": "(Adds details, context)  By Davide Barbuscia  DUBAI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Doha Bank, Qatar\u2019s fifth-biggest lender, has extended by one year a two-year, $575 million bank loan that it had raised in December 2015, but has reduced the size of the facility to $400 million, a bank official said on Tuesday.  \u201cIt was Doha Bank\u2019s conscious decision to have the extension at a reduced level of $400 million of the loan amount in order to streamline and optimise our funding mix and to keep the cost (at a) minimum,\u201d Kaisar Yusuf Khot, manager of the chief executive\u2019s office, said in an emailed response to Reuters questions.  Qatari banks have been working to preserve and broaden their sources of overseas funding since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport links with Qatar last June. The split caused banks from those four states to pull their deposits from Qatari institutions and reduce lending to them.  The original loan to Doha Bank, an unsecured facility, was provided by a group of banks including Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Commerzbank, ING Bank, Mizuho Bank and Wells Fargo, which were appointed bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers.  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Wing Lung Bank participated as mandated lead arrangers, and Commercial Bank of Qatar joined as lead arranger.  The loan had a one-year extension option at the lenders\u2019 discretion, meaning that at the end of its second year, lenders could decide whether or not to prolong the facility.  Doha Bank did not comment on which banks participated in the loan extension. Two sources familiar with the matter said the Chinese, Hong Kong and Japanese banks in the original group chose not to participate, while ANZ, Commercial Bank of Qatar, Commerzbank, ING, and Wells Fargo did take part.

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - The last North Korean to cross this heavily militarized border was shot by his own comrades, and barely escaped with his life.  But when a hefty man proudly sporting lapel pins with the beaming faces of late North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il led a delegation of about 20 North Korean officials over the tense border dividing the two Koreas on Tuesday, they did so to praise from both countries.  The visit - part of the first official talks between the two Koreas in two years - was in stark contrast to the past year of spiraling tensions, punctuated by the dramatic defection of a North Korean soldier in November. It was just meters away from where the diplomatic delegations sipped cups of red ginseng tea on Tuesday.  (For an interactive graphic on inter-Korean talks click tmsnrt.rs/2t8i6no)   Arriving in only Western-style business suits despite sub-zero weather and snow piled on the ground, the head of the North Korean delegation referenced the increased tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program.  \u201cThis winter has seen more snowstorms than ever, and rivers and mountains across the country are frozen,\u201d said Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North\u2019s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland.  \u201cIt would not be an exaggeration to say that inter-Korean ties were even more frozen, but public yearning for improved relations was so strong that today\u2019s precious event was brought about,\u201d he quipped.  \u201cWe came to this meeting with the thought of giving our brethren, who have high hopes for this dialogue, invaluable results as the first present of the year,\u201d he continued in opening remarks, as his officials opened brown paper folders.  Despite scepticism from allies in the United States and Japan, officials in South Korea hope the talks lead to more than just friendly photo ops, including substantive improvements in relations between Seoul and Pyongyang.  Just before Seoul\u2019s delegation drove into the demilitarized zone, some 20 South Koreans were seen holding up a banner that read: \u201cWe wish the success of the high-ranking inter-Korean talks\u201d. One man was spotted waving a flag with a unified Korean peninsula.  The rare meeting come after a year of ramped up North Korean missile launches, its sixth and most powerful nuclear test and an exchange of threats and insults between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, which raised fears of a fresh conflict on the Korean peninsula.  \u201cThere is so much focus on our high-ranking talks today, and considering the high hopes, we were thinking about opening up these talks to the general public,\u201d Ri suggested. \u201cI see many reporters here, how would you feel if we just opened this up?\u201d  Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said it would be better to stick to practice and brief reporters as often as possible.   Cameras and microphones installed in the meeting rooms usually enable government officials to monitor the meetings in real time.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in is being kept up to date on all developments as they occur, according to a Blue House spokesman, but he declined to confirm if Moon is monitoring the talks in real-time. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for Moon to be glued to a screen all day anyway. He\u2019s got his own schedule.\u201d  The officials from the two Koreas sat before bottles of \u2018Pyeongchang Water\u2019 and red ginseng tea, provided by a subsidiary of Lotte Group, a massive South Korean conglomerate that suffered major setbacks in China after it handed over land for a controversial anti-missile system in South Korea.  After two meetings in the morning, Ri and his team returned over the border to lunch at Tongilgak, the North\u2019s building in the truce village of Panmunjom.  The two Koreas usually do not eat together during inter-Korean talks as these breaks are used as opportunities for officials to go over what was discussed and also consult with other government authorities in Seoul and Pyongyang, respectively.  North Korea pledged to send a delegation of high-ranking officials, athletes and a cheering squad to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea next month, South Korea\u2019s vice unification minister Chun Hae-sung said.  Seoul also proposed a number of other measures designed to reduce tensions between the two countries. But Chun cautioned that Tuesday\u2019s meeting would only be the beginning.  \u201cStarting is half the trip, but we can\u2019t expect to be full with just the first spoonful,\u201d he said.

A South Korean investigation appointed by the government  concluded last month the dispute over the women could not be \u201cfundamentally resolved\u201d because the victims\u2019 demand for legal compensation had not been met.  Japan responded by saying any attempt by South Korea to revise the 2015 deal, struck by a conservative South Korean government, would make relations \u201cunmanageable\u201d.  South Korea would not seek to renegotiate the 2015 agreement, even though it failed to meet victims\u2019 needs and resolve the feud, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said on Tuesday.  But she added that she hoped Japan would make further efforts to help the women \u201cregain honor and dignity and heal wounds in their hearts\u201d.  Japan rejected any suggestion it take steps to augment the 2015 deal, under which Japan apologized to the victims and provided 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) to a fund to support them.       \u201cWe can by no means accept South Korea\u2019s demands for  additional measures,\u201d Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono told reporters in Tokyo.  Kono said the 2015 settlement was a \u201cfinal and irreversible resolution\u201d.  \u201cAt a time when we are confronting the threat from North Korea, the Japan-South Korean agreement is an indispensable base for Japan-South Korean cooperation in various fields and the creation of a future-oriented relationship,\u201d Kono said.  South Korea\u2019s Kang did not elaborate on what additional steps South Korea was seeking but a senior foreign ministry official told Reuters it wanted a \u201cvoluntary, sincere apology rather than money\u201d.  South Korean activists estimate there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean women forced to work in the brothels.  There are 31 surviving women registered with the government, a foreign ministry official said.  In 2015, when there were 47, 36 accepted the settlement, a the official said. But others rejected it, and some have been protesting regularly in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.   Those opposed to the 2015 deal want Japan to take legal responsibility and provide due compensation.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in won an election last year after promises on the campaign trail to renegotiate the deal.  But he has also vowed to \u201cnormalize\u201d ties with Japan.  The comfort women issue has been a regular cause for contention between Japan and neighbors China and North and South Korea since the war.   Japan colonized the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and occupied parts of China before and after the war.  Japan says the matter of compensation for the women was settled under a 1965 treaty. It says that in 2015, it agreed to provide the funds to help them heal \u201cpsychological wounds\u201d.  (Refiles to remove extraneous word from paragraph 13.)

Jefferies analysts estimated the 6 percent benefit equates to around 400 million pounds ($541 million), or about 2 percent of sales, and suggested the investment could help BAT compete against Philip Morris International in the growing market for cigarette alternatives seen as less dangerous than smoking.  \u201cA key factor weighing on the multiple relative to Philip Morris has been a feeling that they are trailing in reduced risk,\u201d the analysts said, noting that 2018 will be a \u201chuge year\u201d in shaping the competitive environment for so-called reduced risk products.  Philip Morris and BAT are expected to roll out their respective cigarette alternatives in more markets, including possibly the United States, the world\u2019s biggest market for such products.  BAT, the maker of Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes said on Tuesday that the changes would also result in a non-cash exceptional tax credit as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax balances arising from its acquisition of Reynolds American last year.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dark drama \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d was the big winner with four Golden Globes awards on Sunday on a night marked by scathing jokes about sexual harassment and passionate odes to those breaking their silence.  Mother-daughter comedy \u201cLady Bird\u201d was named best comedy film and the indie A24 movie\u2019s star Saoirse Ronan won for comedy actress.  Gary Oldman was named best drama movie actor for his role as British wartime leader Winston Churchill in Focus Features\u2019 \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d and Frances McDormand took home the award for drama actress for her role as an angry mother seeking vengeance in Fox Searchlight\u2019s \u201cThree Billboards.\u201d  James Franco won the comedy actor award for his cult movie homage \u201cThe Disaster Artist,\u201d also from A24. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro won best director for magical fantasy \u201cThe Shape of Water.\u201d  However, the night was dominated not by who took home prizes but by jokes and speeches about the sexual misconduct scandal that has rocked Hollywood.  \u201cHappy New Year Hollywood! It\u2019s 2018. Marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn\u2019t,\u201d quipped Globes host Seth Meyers in his opening remarks, bringing wild applause from the A-list audience in Beverly Hills.  Multiple allegations against actors, filmmakers and Hollywood agents since October 2017 have led to many of the accused being fired, forced to step down, or dropped from creative projects.  Referring to the male nominees gathered in Beverly Hills  for the top television and movie awards, Meyers said: \u201cThis is the first time in three months it won\u2019t be terrifying to hear your name read out loud.\u201d  The evening began with the normally colorful red carpet transformed into a sea of black gowns as every actress showed solidarity with victims of sexual harassment inside and outside the entertainment industry. Many have given their own harrowing accounts.    Women kept up the theme inside the Beverly Hilton ballroom.  \u201cThis year, we became the story,\u201d Oprah Winfrey said in a rousing speech while accepting the annual lifetime achievement award.  McDormand said she was proud to be a woman in the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be here and be part of the tectonic shift in our industry\u2019s power structure,\u201d she said.  Laura Dern, a supporting actress winner for \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d said: \u201cMay we teach our children that speaking out without retribution is our culture\u2019s new north star.\u201d  The HBO TV series was one of several female-driven winners on Sunday.  The Golden Globes ceremony, the first of the major awards   shows in the run-up to the Oscars in March, marked the first big test for how Hollywood would handle the scandal.  Meyers joked that, as the first of the hosts, he felt like \u201cthe first dog they shot into outer space.\u201d  He appeared to have found the right balance, getting cheers in the room and warm early reviews. Industry website Deadline.com said Meyers \u201cdeftly executed a seemingly impossible task,\u201d while E!

          "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Eleven men were charged in a Singapore court on Tuesday in connection with a large-scale oil theft at Shell\u2019s biggest refinery, while police said they were investigating six other men arrested in a weekend raid.  Police in the island-state said on Tuesday they had detained 17 men, whose ages ranged from 30 to 63, and seized millions of dollars in cash and a small tanker during their investigations into theft at the Pulau Bukom industrial site, which sits just south of Singapore\u2019s main island.  Oil refining and shipping have contributed significantly to Singapore\u2019s rising wealth during the past decades. But the case underlines the challenges the industry faces in a region that has become a hotspot for illegal oil trading.  The investigation began after Shell contacted the authorities in August 2017, police said in a news release. After \u201cextensive investigations and probes,\u201d the Criminal Investigation Department, Police Intelligence Department and Police Coast Guard launched a series of simultaneous raids across Singapore, which led to the arrests.  Nine Singaporeans were immediately charged in the theft, of which eight were employees of the Singapore subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, court documents showed. Two Vietnamese nationals were charged with receiving stolen goods on a small tanker named Prime South (IMO: 9452804), the documents showed.  Shell confirmed on Tuesday that eight of the 11 men charged were current or former employees at Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd.  Shipping data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed the Prime South had been shipping fuel between Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and Singapore for the past 30 days.  Tuesday\u2019s cases could be just the first insight into a grander scheme.  The charges seen so far allege three incidents of gasoil theft: on Nov. 21, 2017, of more than 2,322 tonnes valued at S$1.277 million ($958,564.78); and on Jan. 5 and 7 this year of a combined 2,062 tonnes of gasoil, valued at S$1.126 million.  The Vietnamese nationals were charged with receiving gasoil in the early evening hours of Jan. 7, at wharf 5 at the heart of Shell\u2019s operations on Bukom island, the documents show.  Meanwhile, police say the other six men arrested remain under investigation.  During raids on Sunday, police said they seized S$3.05 million in cash and the 12,000-deadweight-tonne tanker. They have also frozen suspects\u2019 bank accounts.  Shell said on Tuesday it anticipated \u201ca short delay\u201d in its supply operations at Bukom, its largest wholly owned refinery in the world in terms of crude distillation capacity. It declined to say the total amount of oil stolen.  It is the second high-profile case of wrongdoing at companies in Singapore to hit headlines in recent weeks, after Keppel Corporation Ltd\u2019s rig-building business agreed in December to pay more than $422 million to resolve charges it bribed Brazilian officials.  Singapore is one of the world\u2019s most important oil trading hubs, with much of the Middle East\u2019s crude oil passing through Singapore before being delivered to the huge consumers in China, Japan and South Korea.  Singapore is also Southeast Asia\u2019s main refinery hub and the world\u2019s biggest marine refueling stop.  Shell is one of the biggest and longest established foreign investors in Singapore. Its oil refinery on Bukom island can process 500,000 barrels per day.  Illicit oil trading is widespread in Southeast Asia. In some cases, oil has been illegally siphoned from storage tanks, but there have also been thefts at sea, including whole ships being seized for the oil cargo.  The Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) says that siphoning of fuel and oil at sea in Asia, including through armed robbery and piracy, saw sharp increases between 2011 and 2015.  There has been a modest decline since then, although the organization said in a quarterly report that oil theft was still \u201cof concern,\u201d especially in the South China Sea, off the east coast of Malaysia.  The stolen fuel is generally sold across Southeast Asia, offloaded directly into trucks or tanks at small harbors away from oil terminals.

          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong court found an ivory trader guilty of illegal ivory possession and imposed a relatively light penalty of an HK$8,000 ($1,022) fine on Tuesday, less than two weeks after China implemented a total ban on ivory sales.  China is the world\u2019s largest importer and end user of elephant tusks. Wildlife activists called the ban, implemented at the end of 2017, a vital step toward reducing the slaughter of the endangered animals.  Hong Kong trader Lau Sai Yuan was fined HK$8,000 for illegal ivory possession after pleading guilty in Hong Kong\u2019s Eastern Magistrates\u2019 Court. Another trader, Huen Kwok Leung, pleaded not guilty and his trial was postponed to April.  The maximum penalty under current laws is two years in jail.   Hong Kong lawmakers are considering a significant increase in penalties, with a fine of up to HK$10 million and imprisonment of 10 years.  Hong Kong, a Chinese special administrative region of China, has lagged behind mainland China in the crackdown on illegal ivory trading and only set a timetable for a ban last year, with a phase-out time of five years.  The former British colony is a prime transit and consumption hub with more than 90 percent of consumers from mainland China. It has the largest retail market for ivory, which it has traded for more than 150 years.  Hong Kong adheres to regulations set by The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which started to regulate the international trade of ivory in the 1970s and has banned such trade since 1990.  Only \u201cpre-Convention ivory\u201d is allowed to be traded when the ivory is accompanied by a pre-convention certificate.  A Hong Kong government-led operation to combat illegal ivory trading in June 2017 found two ivory traders had sold ivory chopsticks with ivory obtained after the 1990 ban.   Those two traders were fined HK$6,000 and HK$8,000.  China has made a big push to eradicate ivory sales and demand has fallen since early 2014 because of a crackdown on corruption and slower economic growth.  Trade in pre-convention ivory had been thriving in China and Hong Kong since 1975. Environmental activists have long asserted that it has led to an increase in laundering ivory and remains a prime obstacle in eradicating the illegal poaching trade.  WildAid, a wildlife non-government organization, estimates up to 30,000 elephants are killed illegally every year.

          "body": "MANILA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of devotees in the Philippines, many of them barefooted, joined a chaotic procession on Tuesday that featured a black statue of Jesus Christ, one of the biggest annual festivals in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation.  The faithful gathered in downtown Manila to follow a carriage bearing the statue called the Black Nazarene, believed to have healing powers, in a parade that began at dawn and may last until evening or even longer.  Some of them jostled and climbed onto the carriage as it was pushed and pulled by dozens of men holding ropes, while the crowd waved towels and handkerchiefs in a sign of praise to the kneeling life-sized image that carried a cross on one shoulder.   Processions and other religious rites were also held elsewhere in the country of 105 million people to celebrate the feast.  Citing police estimates, media said this year\u2019s festivities may draw 17 million devotees nationwide, some seeking healing for illnesses and forgiveness for sins and others offering thanks for blessings.  Rogelio Lim said all his wishes had come true since he became a Black Nazarene devotee in 1977.  \u201cMy child is now a medicine graduate,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cI have been spared diseases. I have been blessed with a house. Everything we wished for. A good job. Everything. This is why I am here, to thank Him.\u201d  The Philippine Red Cross said it had assisted more than 700 devotees who were feeling unwell, or suffered injuries amid the parade\u2019s growing crowds, many of whom clamored to reach toward the icon.  Alvin Carlos said he felt stronger after touching the Black Nazarene.  \u201cRain or shine, I gained the strength to continue because of my strong faith in Him,\u201d he said.  More than 4,000 police and soldiers were deployed to ensure the Manila procession would be peaceful, said Oscar Albayalde, the capital\u2019s police chief.

The iTraxx Asia ex-Japan investment-grade CDS index narrowed 2bp to 59bp/60bp, supported by expectations of sustained demand for the region\u2019s credits.  Kookmin\u2019s and Woori Bank\u2019s CDS spreads tightened 7bp and 8bp respectively, the best performers today, suggesting a recovery in demand for Korean paper, as North Korea said during talks with the South on Tuesday that it will send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics next month and Seoul said it was prepared to lift some sanctions temporarily to facilitate the visit if needed.

          "body": "MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines\u2019 Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday warned investors to exercise caution when invited to participate in initial coin offerings (ICOs) involving cryptocurrencies.  The warning came after it discovered that \u201ccertain companies, individuals or groups of persons\u201d have been enticing the public to participate in ICOs through social media and their websites and to buy the corresponding virtual currency.   An ICO is the first sale of a virtual currency to the public, usually for the purpose of raising capital for start-up companies or funding independent projects.  The SEC warning follows a similar move last month by the Philippine central bank, which has also flagged risks of investing in virtual currencies.  \u201cWe do not endorse virtual currency as a currency because it is not a currency,\u201d Melchor Plabasan, a central bank deputy director, said then.  The Philippine central bank is seeking to regulate virtual currency exchanges amid the increasing usage of cryptocurrencies, particularly in money remittances and payments.  China has banned ICOs in a move to stop illegal fundraising and pyramid schemes, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has warned that many promoters of ICOs and other cryptocurrency investments in the United States were not following securities laws.

          "body": "MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines\u2019 Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday warned investors to exercise caution when invited to participate in initial coin offerings (ICOs) involving cryptocurrencies.  The warning came after it discovered that \u201ccertain companies, individuals or groups of persons\u201d have been enticing the public to participate in ICOs through social media and their websites and to buy the corresponding virtual currency.   An ICO is the first sale of a virtual currency to the public, usually for the purpose of raising capital for start-up companies or funding independent projects.  The SEC warning follows a similar move last month by the Philippine central bank, which has also flagged risks of investing in virtual currencies.  \u201cWe do not endorse virtual currency as a currency because it is not a currency,\u201d Melchor Plabasan, a central bank deputy director, said then.  The Philippine central bank is seeking to regulate virtual currency exchanges amid the increasing usage of cryptocurrencies, particularly in money remittances and payments.  China has banned ICOs in a move to stop illegal fundraising and pyramid schemes, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has warned that many promoters of ICOs and other cryptocurrency investments in the United States were not following securities laws.  The Philippine SEC said that from information it gathered, \u201csome of these new virtual currencies, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding their issuance, follow the nature of a security\u201d.  \u201cHowever, unlike ordinary securities, these virtual currencies are neither guaranteed by any Central Bank nor backed by any commodity,\u201d it said.

          "body": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch paints and chemicals maker Akzo Nobel and gas network operator Gasunie plan to build Europe\u2019s largest green hydrogen production plant in a bid to cut emissions, the companies said on Tuesday.  The facility, to be built in the northern part of the Netherlands, would use a 20 megawatt (MW) water electrolysis unit to convert sustainable electricity into hydrogen. That would mark an important step in scaling up the technology, which is seen as crucial for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the companies said.  Under pressure to meet strict CO2 emission goals, industrial companies and utilities hope to use excess wind and solar power to create hydrogen, which can then be stored for reconversion into power or for direct industrial use.  \u201cThis technology has enormous potential\u201d, Akzo Nobel energy director Marcel Galjee told Reuters. \u201cWith this first step, we want to show the real possibilities for building a sustainable industry using green energy.\u201d  The planned installation would produce around 3,000 tonnes of green hydrogen each year, which can either be used by Akzo\u2019s specialty chemicals division or be sold to third parties, such as public transport companies using hydrogen buses.   Both companies will look for potential buyers in the coming months and will make a final decision on the project next year, with the building costs expected to run into the \u201ctens of millions\u201d of euros, Galjee said.  The eventual aim is to convert and store sustainable energy in the form of hydrogen on a much larger scale, with plants of at least 100 MW. So far, the largest planned unit in the Netherlands has a capacity of 1 MW.  Industrial factories in the Netherlands currently use more than 800,000 tons of hydrogen produced by natural gas each year.    \u201cReplacing this by sustainably produced hydrogen will reduce CO2 emissions by seven million tonnes\u201d, Galjee said. \u201cHowever, the real potential is in large-scale production as the basis for green chemistry.\u201d  Akzo Nobel is one of the most energy-intensive companies in Europe. It says it currently uses renewable sources for 40 percent of its total energy need and aims to be CO2-neutral by 2050.  Reporting by Bart Meijer, editing by Louise Heavens"

          "body": "MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines will make a diplomatic protest to China, which the southeast Asian nation\u2019s defense minister described as having reneged on a promise not to militarize artificial islands in the busy South China Sea waterway.  The United States has criticized China\u2019s build-up of military facilities on the artificial islands and is concerned they could be used to restrict free movement along the key trade route.  Philippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana\u2019s comment followed a Dec. 30 broadcast of aerial footage by the official China Central Television (CCTV) showing Fiery Cross Reef, which appeared to have been transformed into an airbase.  \u201cThe Chinese government said some time ago that they were not going to militarize those reclaimed islands,\u201d Lorenzana told reporters, adding that the protest would be made through the foreign ministry.   \u201cIf it is true and we can prove that they have been putting soldiers and even weapons systems, that will be a violation of what they said.\u201d  Asked about the protest, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman said the construction was on the country\u2019s territory and was intended to aid peace in the region, as well as maritime safety and disaster prevention.  \u201cOf course, China also needs to construct necessary defense equipment for its territory,\u201d the spokesman, Lu Kang, told a regular briefing on Tuesday. \u201cThe relevant equipment is not directed at any particular country.\u201d   China and the Philippines have long sparred over the South China Sea, but relations have improved considerably under President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been courting Beijing in hopes of winning business and investment.      China has assured the Philippines it will not occupy new features or territory in the South China Sea, under a new \u201cstatus quo\u201d brokered by Manila as both sides try to strengthen their relations.  Reports about China militarizing reclaimed islands were not new, presidential spokesman Harry Roque told a regular news briefing.   \u201cWe have always been against the militarization of the area,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is certainly not OK, because it constitutes a further threat to peace and security in area.\u201d  China is holding to a commitment not to reclaim more islands, Roque added, however.  \u201cThere is still no breach of the good faith obligation for as long as China has not embarked on new reclamation,\u201d he said, when asked about the situation on the reef.  China has denied U.S. charges that it is militarizing the South China Sea, which also is claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.   The reef has a hospital with more than 50 doctors, high-speed mobile connections and an airport with a runway of 3,160 meters (3,456 yards) to serve what Beijing calls a \u201cweather station\u201d equipped with radar, Chinese state media say.   In the last 27 years, China\u2019s navy has sent more than 1,000 soldiers to guard the reef, state media have said.

          "body": "* Yen hits five-day high after BoJ trims buying in long-dated JGBs  * Euro below $1.20 on profit-taking after record long positions  * Dollar index edges up  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Jemima Kelly  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The yen reached a five-day high on Tuesday, after the Bank of Japan trimmed its purchases of long-dated government bonds in market operations, stoking speculation the central bank could start to wind down its huge stimulus policy this year.  Since it adopted its yield-curve-control policy in 2016, the BOJ has occasionally tweaked its bond operations, with officials saying any changes are meant to keep bond yields in line with its policy goal and not to telegraph hints on its future policy .  But while Tuesday\u2019s move was considered largely technical, it surprised some market players and emboldened those analysts who see an exit from the monetary easing programme coming by the end of in 2018.  The yen rose as much as half a percent to 112.50 yen to the dollar, rebounding from the two-week low of 113.40 per dollar it touched on Monday, before easing back to 112.81 yen by 0815 GMT, still up 0.3 percent on the day.  \u201cSpeculation is increasing that the Bank of Japan could tighten policy this year, but in my opinion that\u2019s not justified,\u201d said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt.  Most economists surveyed in a Reuters poll in December said the BoJ would start scaling back its stimulus in late 2018 or after.  The euro - which last week threatened to reach its highest levels in three year, hitting a four-month high - slipped further below $1.20, trading down 0.2 percent on the day at a ten-day low of $1.1941, with investors cautious after a months-long rally.  \u201cI don\u2019t think right now levels substantially above $1.20 are justified,\u201d Reichelt said. \u201cI know the market is very optimistic about the euro, but if you look at the data and the central bank, the ECB (European Central Bank) is still on an expansionary path.\u201d  Many analysts said a correction was inevitable for the common currency after an almost 5 percent rally against the dollar in just six weeks thanks to signs of acceleration in the euro zone economy.  Speculators\u2019 net long position in euro/dollar futures in Chicago reached a record high last week, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday, pointing to potential for profit-taking.  \u201cThe euro is going through a consolidation after it had reached high levels above $1.20. Friday\u2019s euro zone inflation data was somewhat weaker than expected,\u201d said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX and rates strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  \u201cGoing forward, the market\u2019s outlook depends more on U.S. factors,\u201d he said.  The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, edged up 0.1 percent to 92.484 .

          "body": "(Adds details, CEO quotes)  By Costas Pitas  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s second-biggest housebuilder Persimmon hopes to achieve a modest increase in sales this year after saying it expected to beat market expectations on 2017 profits as it sold more homes.  CEO Jeff Fairburn also defended an incentive plan which could see top management make a profit of more than 200 million pounds ($268 million) on share options, including around 110 million pounds for himself.  Persimmon is one of several builders in Britain to benefit from years of rising house prices and government incentive schemes, which the sector has been criticised for not building enough affordable housing.  On Tuesday, Persimmon reported a 9 percent rise in revenue to 3.42 billion pounds ($4.63 billion) and said its pre-tax profit would be \u201cmodestly ahead\u201d of market expectations, which stand at 957 million pounds, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.  It said forward sales were up 10 percent at the end of 2017 to 1.35 billion pounds and it hoped for expand further in demand this year.  \u201cIt really largely depends on the number of selling outlets that we can bring through the process and bring onto site as soon as possible so I think broadly similar but aiming for a modest increase,\u201d said Fairburn.  In December, Persimmon said its chairman and the head of its pay committee would quit after they failed to curb an incentive plan introduced in 2012 which will allow Fairburn, the firm\u2019s finance director and managing director to jointly gain around 240 million pounds before tax.  They are able to sell 40 percent of their share options from the beginning of this year and the remainder can be sold when the next performance target is met, which could be later in 2018.  Fairburn defended the plan on Tuesday but said he had yet to decide whether to exercise his share options at the moment.  \u201cThis was a scheme that was launched at a time where the business was looking to move forward, there were stretching targets,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cNobody has yet exercised any of those share options. From my own perspective, I have not made a decision and I\u2019ll continue to review that,\u201d he said.  $1 = 0.7382 pounds\nEditing by Kate Holton and Jason Neely"

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s leadership team shake-up, designed to restore her authority and address divisions over Brexit, was branded a shambles on Tuesday after one minister quit and media reported another had refused to move jobs.  \u201cNight of the blunt stiletto\u201d was the headline of the Daily Telegraph as newspapers judged that May had failed to draw a line under her travails of 2017, when her position as premier was severely weakened after she called a snap election and lost her Conservative Party\u2019s parliamentary majority.  May had hoped to reset her agenda and strengthen her hand as Britain moves to the second phase of talks over leaving the European Union by shaking up her team of cabinet ministers on Monday.  \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to refresh the government and just to give added impetus to the prime minister\u2019s reform agenda while continuing to deliver on Brexit,\u201d her spokesman said.  However, her party had to delete a tweet naming the wrong person as its new chairman. Then, Education Secretary Justine Greening quit rather than take a job as pensions minister. Finally, media reported Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had simply refused to move roles.  With no changes to the senior finance, Brexit, foreign and interior ministers, opponents said the reshuffle showed her weakness and inability to reassert her authority.  \u201cGreening quits in shambolic reshuffle\u201d, the Times newspaper said while the Daily mail called it \u201creshuffle chaos\u201d.  Despite winning an important agreement last month from the EU to move Brexit talks forward from a first phase to a discussion of future trade, May has been criticised at home for her approach to healthcare, housing, transport and Britain\u2019s overall Brexit plans.  The Conservatives are also reported to be losing members at a time when the main opposition Labour Party, under leftist leader Jeremy Corbyn, is enjoying record levels of support, suggesting to some that it is on course to win a new election due in 2022.  \u201cI appreciate there is a job of work to do,\u201d new Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis told BBC radio.

          "body": "* Germany, Netherlands and Austria sell bonds on Tuesday  * Yields on all three well up from mid-December  * Subdued inflation gives investors a reason to buy  * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr  By Abhinav Ramnarayan  LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Euro zone government bond yields rose on Tuesday as investors made room for new supply from three of the bloc\u2019s best rated countries at relatively attractive levels.  Germany, the Netherlands and Austria are set to sell bonds via auction on Tuesday. The yield on all three countries\u2019 debt has risen in recent weeks as the European economy motors on.  High-grade bonds tend to underperform in benign conditions as investors switch to riskier assets with better returns.  But as a result of the sell-off, those bonds are now looking attractive and some investors are likely selling outstanding holdings to make room for the new supply, analysts said.  \u201cThe broader picture is yields are still low but we still need to be excited a bit on this (upward) move in the last few weeks,\u201d said ING strategist Martin Van Vliet.  The yield on the region\u2019s benchmark, German 10-year debt, edged higher to 0.44 percent on Tuesday, well above the mid-December level of 0.30 percent.  The Dutch equivalent also rose, up one basis point on the day at 0.54 percent and 17 bps higher than its December low, while Austria has seen its 10-year borrowing costs increase 20 bps over the past month to 0.59 percent.  Most euro zone bond yields were flat to one basis point higher on the day.  The three countries are set to sell bonds of varying maturities on Tuesday while Germany is also set for a 10-year auction on Wednesday.  Normally, an improvement in economic conditions would cause investors to be cautious about buying government bonds as it makes an early end to the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying scheme more likely.  But with inflation yet to show a sustained increase, investors would feel reasonably safe buying high-grade debt at these levels.  \u201cTo me, the current Bund yield level makes sense given economic data looks rock solid. The only thing we\u2019re all waiting for is signs of inflationary pressure,\u201d said Van Vliet.  This is more likely to come in the second quarter of the year onwards - and most likely only in the United States to begin with, he said.  Inflation in the euro zone slowed as expected in December to 1.4 percent, well below the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2 percent.  Unemployment data for the bloc \u2014 which should have implications for consumer prices in the future \u2014 is due out at 1000 GMT and expectations are for a small drop to 8.7 percent.

          "body": "(Adds details, share movement, analyst comments)  Jan 9 (Reuters) - SIG Plc, a distributor of specialist building products in Europe, said on Tuesday it would review the controls around cheque issuance after a historical overstatement of cash and trade payables resulted in higher closing net debt for 2017.  Shares in SIG were down 2.5 percent at 169.4 pence at 0813 GMT, after falling as much as 6.4 percent.  SIG, which supplies insulation, energy management and roofing products, said group revenue from continuing operations rose 7.5 percent to 2.8 billion pounds ($3.80 billion) in 2017, with like-for-like sales growing 4 percent.  The company said the overstatement of cash amounted to about 20 million pounds as of December 2016 and about 27 million pounds at the end of June 2017.  \u201c(The) new management has reported errors in previous accounting processes which resulted in year-end cash being overstated ... which means that new guidance for closing net debt is higher,\u201d Liberum analyst Charlie Campbell said.  SIG expects to be about 1.9 times leveraged at the end of 2017, after adjusting for the overstatement, versus Liberum\u2019s estimate of 1.7 times.  \u201cThe only slight disappointment is that the debt position is \u00a320m-\u00a330m worse than expected as the group has chosen to stop the historic deferral of trade payables,\u201d said Peel Hunt analysts in a note.  The company, which has been battling to recover from weak trading in its UK insulation, interiors and offsite construction businesses, said improvement in confidence in Mainland European markets continued to mitigate a weaker second-half margin performance in Britain.  SIG\u2019s UK and Ireland like-for-like sales rose 2.1 percent, higher than the 1.1 percent rise it reported a year earlier.  The company in March hired Meinie Oldersma as CEO to help turn around the businesses across Europe. Its former boss left following a profit warning due to weak demand, tougher competition and project delays.  The company, which has been pursuing a number of actions to strengthen its balance sheet including selling assets and reviewing costs, recently conducted a comprehensive review of its strategy.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 0.3 percent to 399 points, its highest since August 2015 and edging closer to an all-time high of 414.06 points. Euro zone stocks rose 0.2 percent.  Consumer staples and financials were the biggest boosts to the pan-European index after UK supermarket Morrisons reported strong results.  Morrisons rose 3.7 percent after reporting stronger than expected sales over the crucial Christmas period.  Peers Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks & Spencer gained 3.2 and 2 percent respectively and the European retail sector index was up 0.3 percent.  Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 was up 0.3 percent, outperforming European peers and recovering from Monday\u2019s fall.  Telecoms and cable group Altice stole the spotlight, jumping 6.5 percent as investors welcomed a decision to spin off its U.S. unit and simplifying the group\u2019s structure in the process.  Analysts at brokerage Raymond James said the move could also make the Altice European arm a possible acquisition target for rival French telecoms companies.  French catering company Sodexo fell 2.8 percent after downgrades from Kepler Cheuvreux and Credit Suisse.  Reporting by Helen Reid; editing by Tom Pfeiffer"

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in telecoms and cable group Altice (ATCA.AS) (ATUS.N) rose on Tuesday after Altice said its board had approved plans to spin-off its U.S. unit from its European operation.  Altice NV shares, which had slumped by around 54 percent last year mainly due to concerns over the company\u2019s debt burden, were up 9.2 percent at 10.31 euros in early session trading.  Altice said late on Monday that the restructuring was  intended to simplify a sprawling communications empire that executives said encompassed two distinct markets - the United States and Europe.  The U.S. business would be shielded from concerns about the European operation, and it would make a parting $1.5 billion dividend payment that would improve Altice NV\u2019s balance sheet.  Analysts at brokerage Raymond James said the move could also  make the Altice European arm a possible acquisition target for rival French telecoms companies.  \u201cA separate listing of Altice Europe makes a sale of this asset easier, to Bouygues (BOUY.PA) or Iliad (ILD.PA) for instance, which could both consider market consolidation synergies in France, in our view,\u201d Raymond James wrote in a research note.  \u201cHowever, we doubt that the intention to sell is unlikely to be reached in the medium-term, as this would require a material discount to the price paid for these assets,\u201d it added.

          "body": "(Adds details, analyst comments)  Jan 9 (Reuters) - British insurer Hastings Group Holdings Plc said its Chief Executive Gary Hoffman would take over as non-executive chairman in May and promoted Toby van der Meer, managing director of its UK trading subsidiary, as its next CEO.  Hoffman will assume the role from Mike Fairey, who will retire in May. The new CEO will take charge on March 1, Hastings, which operates mainly in the British motor market, said.  \u201cMike Fairey was appointed as chairman to guide the company through its IPO in October 2015 ...  Mike believes that, having successfully achieved those objectives ... it is now the right time for him to step down,\u201d Hastings said.  The insurer said Hoffman had previously indicated that there would \u201ccome a time in the not too distant future when he would look to step down from his role as CEO\u201d.  Under Hoffman, who has been CEO for over five years, Hastings\u2019 share price has surged 83 percent since its October 2015 IPO, compared with a 30 percent rise in the UK non-life insurance index, said Barclays analyst Alan Devlin, who rates Hastings at \u201cequal weight\u201d.  The only surprise is that Hoffman would not be leaving Hastings, the analyst said.  \u201cGiven Gary\u2019s experience and performance as CEO, we view it as a positive that he remains involved in the company going forward, so long as the new CEO is given a free hand to be his own CEO,\u201d Devlin said.  Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Europe called the appointment of van der Meer, who previously worked at Moneysupermarket.com as broadly neutral, adding the operating experience of the current CEO would not be lost.  Hastings, which sells most of its policies via price comparison websites, has reaped gains as more customers use such websites to get competitive prices.

          "body": "TOKYO/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Speculation the Bank of Japan may wind back its monetary stimulus this year gripped markets on Tuesday after the central bank trimmed the amount of its purchases of Japanese government bonds.   Traders appeared to latch on to the BOJ announcement that it will buy less of the long-dated bonds, sending the dollar down about 0.5 percent against the yen and the longer dated 20- and 40-year bond yields up to their highest in a month.  While the move was in line with the BOJ\u2019s subtle reduction in its bond buying, the so-called \u2018stealth tapering\u2019, traders said it highlighted how sensitive markets are to a pullback in the massive stimulus that has been the center piece of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s \u2018Abenomics\u2019 policies of the past 4-1/2 years.   \u201cThis goes to show that the amount of attention being given to the word \u2018tapering,\u2019 or any action from the BOJ in that direction that could be taken as a suggestion of it, there\u2019s a lot of sensitivity around it,\u201d said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank in Tokyo.  BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly dismissed the chance of withdrawing stimulus any time soon, even as some policymakers have recently expressed concerns over the perceived demerits of monetary easing, especially the hit on financial institutions\u2019 profit margins.  That has led to speculation that the central bank may have to consider raising its yield targets or slow purchases of risky assets later in 2018 and bringing Japan in line with a host of developed nations which have started to tighten policy, partly thanks to a synchronized uptick in global growth.  The Federal Reserve raised rates three times last year, while the Bank of Canada tightened policy for the first time in seven years and the European Central Bank has signaled it could start to taper soon.  The BOJ pledged in 2016 to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and 10-year bond yields at around zero percent.   It also keeps a loose pledge to increase its bond holdings at 80 trillion yen ($710.29 billion) per year, although the actual increase was only around 58 trillion last year, which some investors see as an effective tapering of the BOJ\u2019s  stimulus.  On Tuesday, markets were surprised by the central bank\u2019s decision to reduce its purchases of JGBs with 10 to 25 years left to maturity as it was the first cut in that tenor in more than a year.  In all, the BOJ cut buying of 10 to 25 year bonds and 25 to 40 year paper by 10 billion yen ($88.39 million) each, from its previous operations, to 190 billion yen and 80 billion respectively.   The announcement pushed the dollar to a session low of 112.50 yen JPY=, down around 0.5 percent on the day.   In the Japanese bond market the selloff was more measured, with yields on 20-year to 40-year paper rising to one-month highs but still well below last year\u2019s peaks.  \u201cWhile it has become difficult to bid up JGBs, there\u2019s no reason to sell JGBs considering that the BOJ is highly unlikely to change its policy at least until it will have a new leadership in April,\u201d said Ryoko Tada, fixed income analyst at Nomura Securities.  None of the bank\u2019s current nine policy board members has proposed any reduction in stimulus. One has even proposed a further easing.  Since it adopted the yield curve control policy in 2016, the BOJ has tweaked its bond operations more than 10 times.   BOJ officials say any changes are fine-tuning meant to keep bond yields in line with its policy goal and not to telegraph hints on its future policy.       Some analysts say the inconsistency of the two policy targets requires a change of tack from the BOJ -  a call the BOJ has shrugged off for many months.  \u201cIt\u2019s better to use the upcoming Jan. 23 meeting to tweak the policy \u2013 with a fresh balance sheet target at 40 trillion yen,\u201d Westpac analysts said in a note.  The difficulty is that inflation remains far off the BOJ\u2019s 2 percent target. Slow wage growth is one of the challenges.  Data on Tuesday showed Japan\u2019s real wages, which are adjusted for inflation, posted their first gain in 11 months in November, helped by a rise in year-end bonuses. But the increase was just 0.1 percent and economists warn that wages are unlikely to keep up with general price increases, which could hurt consumption.  \u201cRegular pay is set to strengthen only slowly ... the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2 percent inflation target won\u2019t be reached anytime soon,\u201d said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - The last North Korean to cross this heavily militarized border was shot by his own comrades, and barely escaped with his life.  But when a hefty man proudly sporting lapel pins with the beaming faces of late North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il led a delegation of about 20 North Korean officials over the tense border dividing the two Koreas on Tuesday, they did so to praise from both countries.  The visit - part of the first official talks between the two Koreas in two years - was in stark contrast to the past year of spiraling tensions, punctuated by the dramatic defection of a North Korean soldier in November. It was just meters away from where the diplomatic delegations sipped cups of red ginseng tea on Tuesday.  (For an interactive graphic on inter-Korean talks click tmsnrt.rs/2t8i6no)   Arriving in only Western-style business suits despite sub-zero weather and snow piled on the ground, the head of the North Korean delegation referenced the increased tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program.  \u201cThis winter has seen more snowstorms than ever, and rivers and mountains across the country are frozen,\u201d said Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North\u2019s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland.  \u201cIt would not be an exaggeration to say that inter-Korean ties were even more frozen, but public yearning for improved relations was so strong that today\u2019s precious event was brought about,\u201d he quipped.  \u201cWe came to this meeting with the thought of giving our brethren, who have high hopes for this dialogue, invaluable results as the first present of the year,\u201d he continued in opening remarks, as his officials opened brown paper folders.  Despite scepticism from allies in the United States and Japan, officials in South Korea hope the talks lead to more than just friendly photo ops, including substantive improvements in relations between Seoul and Pyongyang.  Just before Seoul\u2019s delegation drove into the demilitarized zone, some 20 South Koreans were seen holding up a banner that read: \u201cWe wish the success of the high-ranking inter-Korean talks\u201d. One man was spotted waving a flag with a unified Korean peninsula.  The rare meeting come after a year of ramped up North Korean missile launches, its sixth and most powerful nuclear test and an exchange of threats and insults between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, which raised fears of a fresh conflict on the Korean peninsula.  \u201cThere is so much focus on our high-ranking talks today, and considering the high hopes, we were thinking about opening up these talks to the general public,\u201d Ri suggested. \u201cI see many reporters here, how would you feel if we just opened this up?\u201d  Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said it would be better to stick to practice and brief reporters as often as possible.   Cameras and microphones installed in the meeting rooms usually enable government officials to monitor the meetings in real time.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in is being kept up to date on all developments as they occur, according to a Blue House spokesman, but he declined to confirm if Moon is monitoring the talks in real-time. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for Moon to be glued to a screen all day anyway. He\u2019s got his own schedule.\u201d  The officials from the two Koreas sat before bottles of \u2018Pyeongchang Water\u2019 and red ginseng tea, provided by a subsidiary of Lotte Group, a massive South Korean conglomerate that suffered major setbacks in China after it handed over land for a controversial anti-missile system in South Korea.  After two meetings in the morning, Ri and his team returned over the border to lunch at Tongilgak, the North\u2019s building in the truce village of Panmunjom.  The two Koreas usually do not eat together during inter-Korean talks as these breaks are used as opportunities for officials to go over what was discussed and also consult with other government authorities in Seoul and Pyongyang, respectively.  North Korea pledged to send a delegation of high-ranking officials, athletes and a cheering squad to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea next month, South Korea\u2019s vice unification minister Chun Hae-sung said.  Seoul also proposed a number of other measures designed to reduce tensions between the two countries. But Chun cautioned that Tuesday\u2019s meeting would only be the beginning.  \u201cStarting is half the trip, but we can\u2019t expect to be full with just the first spoonful,\u201d he said.

That has led to speculation that the central bank may have to consider raising its yield targets or slow purchases of risky assets later in 2018 and bringing Japan in line with a host of developed nations which have started to tighten policy, partly thanks to a synchronized uptick in global growth.  The Federal Reserve raised rates three times last year, while the Bank of Canada tightened policy for the first time in seven years and the European Central Bank has signaled it could start to taper soon.  The BOJ pledged in 2016 to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and 10-year bond yields at around zero percent.   It also keeps a loose pledge to increase its bond holdings at 80 trillion yen ($710.29 billion) per year, although the actual increase was only around 58 trillion last year, which some investors see as an effective tapering of the BOJ\u2019s  stimulus.  On Tuesday, markets were surprised by the central bank\u2019s decision to reduce its purchases of JGBs with 10 to 25 years left to maturity as it was the first cut in that tenor in more than a year.  In all, the BOJ cut buying of 10 to 25 year bonds and 25 to 40 year paper by 10 billion yen ($88.39 million) each, from its previous operations, to 190 billion yen and 80 billion respectively.   The announcement pushed the dollar to a session low of 112.50 yen JPY=, down around 0.5 percent on the day.   In the Japanese bond market the selloff was more measured, with yields on 20-year to 40-year paper rising to one-month highs but still well below last year\u2019s peaks.  \u201cWhile it has become difficult to bid up JGBs, there\u2019s no reason to sell JGBs considering that the BOJ is highly unlikely to change its policy at least until it will have a new leadership in April,\u201d said Ryoko Tada, fixed income analyst at Nomura Securities.  None of the bank\u2019s current nine policy board members has proposed any reduction in stimulus. One has even proposed a further easing.  Since it adopted the yield curve control policy in 2016, the BOJ has tweaked its bond operations more than 10 times.   BOJ officials say any changes are fine-tuning meant to keep bond yields in line with its policy goal and not to telegraph hints on its future policy.       Some analysts say the inconsistency of the two policy targets requires a change of tack from the BOJ -  a call the BOJ has shrugged off for many months.  \u201cIt\u2019s better to use the upcoming Jan. 23 meeting to tweak the policy \u2013 with a fresh balance sheet target at 40 trillion yen,\u201d Westpac analysts said in a note.  The difficulty is that inflation remains far off the BOJ\u2019s 2 percent target. Slow wage growth is one of the challenges.  Data on Tuesday showed Japan\u2019s real wages, which are adjusted for inflation, posted their first gain in 11 months in November, helped by a rise in year-end bonuses. But the increase was just 0.1 percent and economists warn that wages are unlikely to keep up with general price increases, which could hurt consumption.  \u201cRegular pay is set to strengthen only slowly ... the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2 percent inflation target won\u2019t be reached anytime soon,\u201d said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.

          "body": "(Adds details, background)  Abu Dhabi, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Etihad Airways has hired former JetBlue executive Mark Powers as group chief financial officer, the Abu Dhabi-based carrier said on Tuesday.  Long-serving Group CFO James Rigney left the troubled airline along with CEO James Hogan in July.  Powers will join Etihad this month, the airline said in a statement.  He was CFO at JetBlue from 2011 until 2016, having joined the New York-headquartered airline as treasurer in 2006.  JetBlue has been critical of attempts by American Airlines , Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines to restrict the growth of Etihad and other Gulf carriers over accusations they receive unfair state subsidies. The Gulf carriers have denied the subsidy claims.  Powers will head the finances of Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) which oversees Etihad Airways, engineering, airport, travel services units, and its investments in other carriers.  \u201cThe Etihad Aviation Group Board believes Mark and the wider finance team will play a pivotal role in helping to guide Etihad onto the next stage of its development,\u201d said Group CEO Tony Douglas, who joined the airline this month.  Etihad reported a $1.9 billion loss for 2016, its first since 2010. Like fellow Gulf carriers Emirates and Qatar Airways, it has had to battle overcapacity, security concerns and a drop in regional business travel in recent years.  Etihad cut, or announced it was dropping, several routes last year including to U.S. cities San Francisco and Dallas.  On Monday, Etihad signed an aviation security pact with Emirates, the first such cooperation agreement between the two UAE-based rivals.  Etihad has also been hampered by stakes it has bought in more than half a dozen airlines.  Key investments Air Berlin and Italy\u2019s Alitalia both entered administration last year.  Etihad has sold its holding in Swiss-based regional airline Darwin but still has stakes in Virgin Australia, Air Seychelles, Air Serbia, and India\u2019s Jet Airways .  Powers takes over from Ricky Thirion who held the position in an acting capacity since July 1.  Thirion will resume his role as group treasurer, Etihad said.

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in telecoms and cable group Altice (ATCA.AS) (ATUS.N) rose on Tuesday after Altice said its board had approved plans to spin-off its U.S. unit from its European operation.  Altice NV shares, which had slumped by around 54 percent last year mainly due to concerns over the company\u2019s debt burden, were up 9.2 percent at 10.31 euros in early session trading.  Altice said late on Monday that the restructuring was  intended to simplify a sprawling communications empire that executives said encompassed two distinct markets - the United States and Europe.  The U.S. business would be shielded from concerns about the European operation, and it would make a parting $1.5 billion dividend payment that would improve Altice NV\u2019s balance sheet.  Analysts at brokerage Raymond James said the move could also  make the Altice European arm a possible acquisition target for rival French telecoms companies.  \u201cA separate listing of Altice Europe makes a sale of this asset easier, to Bouygues (BOUY.PA) or Iliad (ILD.PA) for instance, which could both consider market consolidation synergies in France, in our view,\u201d Raymond James wrote in a research note.  \u201cHowever, we doubt that the intention to sell is unlikely to be reached in the medium-term, as this would require a material discount to the price paid for these assets,\u201d it added.

          "body": "HAMBURG, Jan 9 (Reuters) - German industrial workers are widening industrial action on Tuesday, with tens of thousands of staff at metals and engineering companies expected to down their tools in support of wage claims by union IG Metall.  With the economy in robust health and unemployment at record lows, the country\u2019s biggest union is demanding an inflation-busting 6 percent pay hike this year for about 3.9 million workers.  Ahead of a round of regional negotiations due to begin on Thursday, employers have so far offered 2 percent plus a one-off 200 euro ($240) payment in the first quarter.  IG Metall has called for industrial action at 143 companies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the industrial heartland of Germany, including LED components firm Lumileds and Thyssenkrupp unit Rothe Erde.  In Bavaria, employees at 32 companies are expected to walk out.  That adds to more than 15,000 workers that have already taken action across the nation since the start of last week.  IG Metall is also campaigning for a right to reduce weekly hours to 28 from 35, and return to full-time employment after two years, for shift workers and those caring for children or other relatives.  Employers have rejected that proposal too.  The nationwide dispute follows a strong year of growth in Europe\u2019s largest economy, driven by domestic demand from record numbers of German workers while borrowing costs and inflation remain low and exporters benefit from a global recovery.  That pattern should extend through 2018, with the Ifo economic institute last month forecasting growth of 2.6 percent for the year.  Talks between unions and employers\u2019 associations are set for Thursday in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Volkswagen\u2019s Porsche, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler and automotive suppliers including Bosch are based.  Next door in Bavaria, home to companies such as engineering group Siemens and carmaker BMW, negotiations will resume on Jan. 15, and to the north in North Rhine-Westphalia on Jan. 18.  $1 = 0.8299 euros\nReporting by Jan Schwartz; Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing\nby Louise Heavens"

          "body": "(Repeats story first published on Jan 8, text unchanged)  By Jamie McGeever  LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have kicked off 2018 with their biggest bet ever on the euro rising, a clear vote of confidence in the single currency but, with positioning so stretched, one which could backfire in the near term.  Data from the Chicago Futures Trading Commission show that hedge funds and speculative accounts ramped up their net long euro positions by more than 35,000 contracts to 127,868 in the week to Jan. 2, a bet worth $19.3 billion.  That\u2019s the largest net long euro position since the single currency\u2019s inception 19 years ago, overtaking the previous high of 119,538 contracts registered in mid-May 2007.  The \u2018fast money\u2019 community\u2019s bet on the euro has been a major driver of the currency\u2019s rise. It gained 14 percent against the dollar last year, its best year since 2003 and third best ever.  It\u2019s easy to see why. Positive surprises from the euro zone economy beat positive U.S. economic surprises for much of 2017 (although that trend reversed late last year) and the euro zone economy grew at 2.6 percent in the third quarter, its fastest since 2011.  According to the European Commission, the European economy, the bulk of which comprises the 19 nations that use the euro, grew 2.3 percent last year compared to the United States\u2019 2.2 percent.  The \u201ceuroboom\u201d, as it has come to be known, is one of the most important components of a wider economic upswing that now has world growth closing in on 4 percent.  The euro climbed to a four-month high last week of $1.2089 , within a whisker of breaking above September\u2019s peak of $1.2092 which would have heralded a fresh three-year peak.  Analysts at Deutsche Bank, among others, have raised their forecasts for the euro. They see it reaching $1.30 by the end of the year on the back of strong capital flows into the region.  But with positioning so stretched, the question is whether the euro\u2019s upward momentum can be sustained.  The euro on Monday was down for the second day in a row, something not seen for a month. It was back below $1.20, albeit it only just, and recent history suggests it will be difficult to stay above that level for any length of time without fresh tailwinds.  Much depends on the relative paths of U.S. Fed and European Central Bank monetary policy.  Traders are betting that the Fed won\u2019t tighten too aggressively, while doubts are growing on how long the European Central Bank can stick with negative interest rates with growth so strong and oil prices at their highest in three years.  Yet a strong euro will surely make ECB policymakers think twice about how quickly and aggressively they tighten. A general rule of thumb states that a 10 percent rise in the euro corresponds with a fall of nearly 0.5 percentage points in inflation over the next 12 months.  Annual euro zone inflation fell to 1.4 percent in December, moving away from the ECB\u2019s target of \u201cbelow, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term.\u201d  The euro\u2019s 14 percent rise against the dollar last year (admittedly only 5 percent on a trade-weighted basis) will help keep a lid on the inflationary pressures being stoked by strong growth and high oil prices.  When positioning was almost as stretched back in May 2007, hedge funds and speculators began scaling back their long positions. So much so that almost a year later they were net short of euros.  But the euro/dollar exchange rate didn\u2019t reverse. It went from around $1.35 at the CFTC peak net long all the way through $1.60 by April 2008, just as global markets were about to come crashing down later that year.

But the gesture has been criticized by Human Rights Watch which said it shows the military junta chief\u2019s \u201ccontempt of media criticism\u201d in a country yet to restore democracy since a 2014 coup.  Seventeen life-sized cutouts of Prayuth have been set up around the government compound ahead of Children\u2019s Day on Saturday. They show Prayuth in various outfits including sportswear, work suits and traditional Thai attire.  On Monday, Prayuth spoke briefly at Government House before a cutout of Prayuth in a suit and tie was brought out. Prayuth, who is known for his abstruse sense of humor, then told journalists to refer any questions to the cardboard cutout.  \u201cAsk this guy,\u201d he said.  Reaction to the bizarre gesture was largely muted on social media on Tuesday but Human Rights Watch said it added to a \u201clong list of his bizarre and bullying reactions to reporters\u201d.  \u201cThailand\u2019s junta leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha continues to show contempt of media criticism and scrutiny,\u201d Sunai Phasuk, senior Thailand researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.  The general is known for going off-script and for his public outbursts which are sometimes dismissed as mildly amusing even by his staunchest critics. His comments have also been menacing.   In 2015 he warned journalists that he had the power to execute them. In another, separate incident he threw a banana peel at a reporter.  Prayuth\u2019s government has announced it will hold a general election in November 2018 after repeatedly delaying the vote.   However, it has yet to lift a ban on political campaigning despite pressure from groups of all political stripes.  \u201cEven when the junta promises to hold an election, there is no open space for media freedom,\u201d said Sunai.

Traders are betting that the Fed won\u2019t tighten too aggressively, while doubts are growing on how long the European Central Bank can stick with negative interest rates with growth so strong and oil prices at their highest in three years.  Yet a strong euro will surely make ECB policymakers think twice about how quickly and aggressively they tighten. A general rule of thumb states that a 10 percent rise in the euro corresponds with a fall of nearly 0.5 percentage points in inflation over the next 12 months.  Annual euro zone inflation fell to 1.4 percent in December, moving away from the ECB\u2019s target of \u201cbelow, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term.\u201d  The euro\u2019s 14 percent rise against the dollar last year (admittedly only 5 percent on a trade-weighted basis) will help keep a lid on the inflationary pressures being stoked by strong growth and high oil prices.  When positioning was almost as stretched back in May 2007, hedge funds and speculators began scaling back their long positions. So much so that almost a year later they were net short of euros.  But the euro/dollar exchange rate didn\u2019t reverse. It went from around $1.35 at the CFTC peak net long all the way through $1.60 by April 2008, just as global markets were about to come crashing down later that year.  Will a similar pattern be repeated this time around?  Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"

          "body": "ZURICH, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Sika beat both its annual sales target and market expectations in 2017, the Swiss construction chemicals maker said on Tuesday, forecasting even faster growth in 2018.  The company, which has been mired in a bitter takeover battle with France\u2019s Saint-Gobain for three years, reported annual sales of 6.25 billion Swiss francs ($6.39 billion) for 2017 - exceeding its target of 6 billion francs.  The 8.9 percent increase in local currencies narrowly beat the average estimate of 6.2 billion francs in a Reuters poll, and was marked by a faster growth rate during its fourth quarter as a raft of acquisitions kicked in.  Sika, which makes additives for building materials and adhesives for cars, said it expected an even higher increase in its 2017 profits, anticipating beating its previous highest net profit of 567 million francs it made in 2016.  It said it expected operating profit of 880 to 900 million francs for 2017. The company, which shrugged off the departure of Chief Executive Jan Jenisch to cement maker LafargeHolcim , is due to report its earnings on Feb 23.  Under new CEO Paul Schuler, the company was even more bullish about 2018, saying it expected sales growth of more than 10 percent and an ever higher growth rate for operating profit.  The improvements reflected Sika\u2019s investments during 2017, Schuler said. The company veteran has already indicated the company will ramp up its buying spree.  \u201cWith nine new factories, three further national subsidiaries, and seven company takeovers, we have made significant investment in growth markets as well as in growth platforms in the form of product technologies and distribution channels,\u201d Schuler said.  \u201cThese 19 strategic investments, our pipeline with innovative quality products and our global presence - we now have 100 national subsidiaries and more than 200 factories - allow us to look toward the future with optimism.\u201d  The company was entering 2018 with significant momentum, with high organic growth as well as a faster pace of acquisitions, Bernstein analyst Phil Roseberg said.  \u201cSika outperformed against already high expectations in 2017,\u201d said Roseberg.  \u201cWe interpret a \u2018disproportionate increase\u2019 in EBIT to suggest that Sika is confident about offsetting the dilutive impact of M&A and posting another year of margin expansion in 2018,\u201d he added.  Sika did not mention its takeover fight with Saint-Gobain, which was sparked by the Swiss company\u2019s founding family wanting to sell its controlling stake to the French group.  The next court decision \u2014 centering on the family\u2019s voting rights \u2014 is expected in the next few months.  $1 = 0.9784 Swiss francs\nReporting by John Revill"

The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) said in a notice that it had fined the Shandong-based Kama Automobile Manufacturing Ltd 31.74 million yuan for exceeding emissions standards in its diesel trucks and for misusing pollution control devices in order to pass inspections.  It also fined the Shandong Tangjun Ouling Automobile Co Ltd more than 7 million yuan after 109 of the company\u2019s light diesel trucks were found to have exceeded emissions standards.  The fines include confiscated revenues as well as an additional levy set at twice the value of the substandard vehicles, the ministry said.  Kama Automobiles and Tangjun Ouling could not be immediately reached for comment.  The environment ministry said the move was the first time that automakers had been fined as a result of violations of China\u2019s air pollution regulations, and showed the country would display \u201czero tolerance\u201d for firms that break the law.  Tackling vehicle pollution has been a key element of the country\u2019s ongoing war on pollution, especially in its big cities, with emissions from cars believed to contribute about 40 percent of total air pollution in the Chinese capital, Beijing.

          "title": "City of London says Brexit job fears may be over-egged",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - British banking, insurance and asset management job losses to the European Union due to Brexit might not be as heavy as initially feared, the City of London financial district said on Monday.  Jeremy Browne, the City\u2019s EU envoy, said UK-based firms opening hubs in the bloc after Britain leaves next year are looking for the least disruption possible.  \u201cIt may end up for quite a lot of them being a bit less dramatic than it might appear,\u201d Browne said as Britain embarks on a new phase of talks with the EU over its exit.  \u201cIt don\u2019t think they are saying \u2018Shall we abandon London?\u2019,\u201d Browne told a press briefing as he begins a five-month trip around EU states to meet policymakers.  Financial services in Britain raise over 70 billion pounds  ($95 billion) in taxes annually, but Browne said new hubs will likely be staffed by hundreds rather than thousands.  The City expects 5,000 to 13,000 job losses among the 1.1 million people employed in the sector across Britain. This chimes with 10,000 losses the Bank of England said is plausible on Brexit Day in March 2019.  Consultants like Oliver Wyman have forecast losses of 75,000 or far higher, though over several years.  Browne, a former junior UK foreign minister, said France sees winning UK financial jobs as a \u201cnational endeavour\u201d led by French President Emmanuel Macron. Germany is also courting financial jobs, but in a less \u201cemotionally attached\u201d way.  Britain and the EU agreed in December to open talks on a transition period and final trading terms.  Browne said transition should ideally not depart dramatically from the UK\u2019s current links with the bloc, though some \u201ctweaks\u201d were inevitable.  \u201cSpeed is of the essence,\u201d Browne said.  The City wants an imaginative trade deal that is more comprehensive than the one negotiated by the bloc with Canada, but stopping short of joining Norway in the European Economic Area (EEA), he said.  Browne refers to this as \u201cunoccupied ground\u201d, meaning no such trade deal on financial services has been done with the EU before.  Norway pays into the bloc\u2019s budget and accepts free movement of EU citizens within its borders, conditions that pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain reject on sovereignty grounds.  \u201cThere is a lot of space between Canada and being in the EEA,\u201d Browne said.  Adopting the EU\u2019s \u201cone-way\u201d system of equivalence, whereby the EU grants market access to foreign banks if they operate under similar rules to those of the bloc, is a non-starter for most in the City, Browne said.  \u201cPeople are quite hardline about not having equivalence as the final state,\u201d Browne said.  The City wants a trade deal that would allow the UK and EU to accept each other\u2019s financial rules, with a mechanism to resolve any disputes, a more partnership-based approach than equivalence.  The EU is, however, very worried about how non-EU countries like Switzerland or the United States would react if it gave preferential treatment to the City, Browne said.  The Bank of England said in December it would spare EU banks in London from having to find costly capital to convert from branches to subsidiaries after Brexit if EU regulators reciprocated.  Financial lawyers like Barney Reynolds have said that some form of equivalence may be Britain\u2019s most realistic bet in the immediate term given the time it takes to negotiate trade deals.

          "body": "Jan 9 (Reuters) - Foreign investors were net sellers of Asian equities in December as they booked profits, however, analysts expect inflows into the region to pick up this year.  December data from seven Asian exchanges showed foreign outflows for the month totalled about $3.7 billion. For 2017, the region received $20 billion in foreign money.  Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG markets in Singapore, said profit taking had been a key reason for the offloading of Asian equities in December. However, she doesn\u2019t expect this trend to persist in 2018.  \u201cThe momentum may even pick up as investors turn to look at the cheaper alternatives to the likes of the U.S. market,\u201d said Pan.  Despite a big stock rally last year, Asian shares are still cheaper than stock markets in the United States and Europe. Asia\u2019s forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio stood at 15.3, against North America\u2019s 22.3 and Europe\u2019s 17, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Asian stocks have started this year on a positive note, with MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising more than 3 percent already. The index rose more than 33 percent in 2017.  Expecting higher exports in Asia, driven by a synchronised global recovery, analysts are raising their 2018 earnings outlook for Asian companies.  Over the past month, analysts have increased their earnings forecasts for Asian companies by 1.5 percent, with India, Vietnam and South Korean companies seeing the biggest upgrades.  DBS Bank expects Asian markets in aggregate to have returns of 3-15 percent in 2018 in local currency terms, excluding dividends.  However, analysts believe major central banks\u2019 more aggressive monetary policies could be a risk for foreign flows this year.  The recent U.S. jobs data showed gains in monthly wages in December, which could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in March.  \u201cThe only concern (for Asian equities) may be the degree of volatility that central banks\u2019 tightening could bring to the relatively riskier Asia market that may dent sentiment and fund flows,\u201d said IG markets\u2019 Pan.

London copper hit a two-week low overnight, weighed down by a stronger dollar, which encouraged sellers in the benchmark U.S. dollar-denominated contract.  * LONDON COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.5 percent at $7,160 a tonne by 0700 GMT, after closing almost unchanged in the previous session.

          "title": "Commentary: Cracks in Russia-Iran alliance open options for Trump",
          "body": "Iran and Russia have made no secret of their mutual desire to sideline the United States in the Middle East. \u201cOur cooperation can isolate America,\u201d Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u00a0told Vladimir Putin during the Russian president\u2019s recent visit to Tehran. Putin, for his part, has praised the Moscow-Tehran relationship as \u201cvery productive.\u201d  Certainly the alliance has paid dividends in Syria, where the Moscow-Tehran military collaboration\u00a0turned\u00a0the tide of the war in favor of their mutual ally Bashar al-Assad and compelled the United States to\u00a0abandon\u00a0its goal of forcing Assad from power. Nevertheless, while Washington should certainly be wary of the Russian-Iranian relationship, it is less a strategic alliance than a marriage of convenience \u2013 and one whose cracks are already showing.  In Syria, the ousting of Islamic State seems to have underscored important differences in the goals and tactics of Putin and Khameini. Moscow\u2019s ultimate objectives include\u00a0preventing\u00a0regime change, promoting Russian\u00a0influence\u00a0in the Middle East,\u00a0and keeping its military bases in Syria. Achieving these aims, Putin hopes, may lead to diplomatic gains in the West, and encourage the United States to\u00a0recognize\u00a0Russia as an equal. However, while Moscow considers Assad to be Syria's legitimate leader, Putin\u2019s main interest lies in preserving and strengthening Syrian state institutions rather than Assad personally; the Russians have even\u00a0suggested\u00a0to their Western counterparts that Moscow would accept Assad's departure as long as it occurred as part of an overall peace process.  The Iranians, by contrast,\u00a0consider\u00a0Assad's departure a \"red line\" and believe that keeping the Syrian leader in power remains crucial to two of its key objectives. The first is to maintain its ability\u00a0to supply its longtime Shi\u2019ite proxy Hezbollah with weaponry while\u00a0building a \u201cSunni free\u201d Shi\u2019ite land corridor from Iran to the Mediterranean \u2013 a development Iran fears a new government would not permit. Second, Iran believes that its presence in Syria is critical to Tehran's ability to pressure Israel. Iran wants to retain the ability to strike at the Jewish state from both Lebanon and Syria, hence Iran\u2019s determination to maintain non-state Shi\u2019ite proxy militias in Syria. Iran's hardline Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)\u00a0wants\u00a0to turn these proxies into an institutionalized political and military force similar to Hezbollah in Lebanon - a measure that conflicts with Russia's desire to build up the capabilities of the Syrian state and reduce Syria\u2019s dependence on Iran.  As diplomatic negotiations over Syria's future heat up, the differences between Russian and Iranian goals there threaten to intensify. Iran in particular believes that Russia's\u00a0willingness\u00a0to work with countries like Turkey could undermine Iranian interests in Syria. Iran\u2019s leaders are also concerned about Putin\u2019s relationship with Donald Trump; reports from Iranian media suggest that Tehran was angry about Putin\u2019s decision to brief the U.S. president about Moscow\u2019s objectives ahead of last November\u2019s Sochi summit between Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.  Russia's willingness to work with multiple partners in Syria is emblematic of Russia's broader approach to the Middle East, which a leading Russian analyst\u00a0describes\u00a0as the \"dogma of flexibility\" - something in accord with Putin's\u00a0transactional\u00a0approach to foreign policy. One example of this is Moscow's\u00a0desire\u00a0to maintain a good relationship with Sunni Saudi Arabia. Putin believes Russian-Saudi cooperation is needed to limit oil production and prop up prices, which he needs to meet his twin objectives of building up Russia's military while also strengthening the Russian state\u00a0internally. The problem for Putin is that Shi'ite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia are locked in a bitter competition for influence across the Middle East, so Iran naturally resents the Kremlin's rapprochement after years of tension between Moscow and Riyadh.  Under Putin's leadership, Russia has also\u00a0developed\u00a0the best relationship it has ever had with Israel. Putin has visited Israel twice \u2013 the first Russian leader ever to do so \u2013 and has hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu multiple times to discuss Israel's interests in Syria. Putin\u00a0reportedly\u00a0enjoys good personal chemistry with Netanyahu and has\u00a0instructed\u00a0both Assad and Hezbollah not to retaliate against Israeli strikes in Syria. Putin even\u00a0seeks\u00a0a deal that would prevent foreign powers from using Syria as a base for attacking a neighboring state, which is directly at odds with Iran\u2019s objective of using Syria as a platform to pressure Israel's northern border. However, given the deep Israeli-Iranian hostility,\u00a0it\u2019s clear that Moscow's good relationship with the Jewish state could exacerbate underlying tensions in the Russian-Iranian relationship.  Exacerbating underlying Russian-Iranian tensions is a longtime historical mistrust between the two countries. Russian-Persian conflicts in the 18th and 19th centuries\u00a0resulted\u00a0in Moscow's seizure of the\u00a0Caucasus \u2013 a loss which reverberates in the Iranian psyche even today. After Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, the relationship between the two sides\u00a0was similarly tense, most notably because Russia favored Iraq during the Iraq-Iran war \u2013 a conflict that\u00a0cost\u00a0Iran approximately one million lives. And while it\u2019s true that Russian-Iranian relations improved significantly after the fall of the Soviet Union, Tehran still remembers Moscow supported sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program and has\u00a0suspended\u00a0a number of deals with Iran in order to improve the Russian-American relationship.  The Trump administration should seek to use the various Russian-Iranian differences to undermine the two sides\u2019 partnership. First and foremost, this requires Washington to remain active in the Middle East and eliminate the perception that it\u2019s abandoning the region.  The United States could also seek to improve relations with Russia, which arguably would be both beneficial in and of itself, while also playing on Iran\u2019s historical distrust of its northern neighbor and Tehran\u2019s fear that Moscow could ultimately sell Iran out for the sake of improving Russia\u2019s relationship with the West. Simply having Trump signal to Putin that the United States is prepared to treat Russia as an equal \u2013 one of Putin\u2019s objectives \u2013 could go some way towards achieving this. Trump should also remind Putin of the cracks already showing in the Russian-Iranian relationship and ask him whether it\u2019s really in Moscow\u2019s interests to support Iran\u2019s sectarian objectives in Syria.  It won\u2019t be easy, but if Washington policy-makers play their cards right they can still undermine the strategic alliance that Moscow and Tehran so clearly want.

          "body": "(Adds detail, analyst reaction)  By John Revill  ZURICH, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank expects an annual profit of 54 billion Swiss francs ($55.25 billion) for 2017, the central bank said on Tuesday, the biggest profit in its 110-year history.  The SNB anticipates an annual profit of 49 billion francs from its foreign currency positions, which have swelled to 784 billion francs by November as it sought to weaken the Swiss franc and have increased in value as the Swiss currency depreciated last year.  The bank, which will give its full earning figures on March 5, said it also expects a valuation gain of 3 billion francs on its gold holdings.  The forecast profit would be more than double the 24.5 billion francs the SNB made in 2016, and exceed its previous highest annual profit of 38.3 billion francs in 2014.  The profit is good news for the SNB in its battle against the strength of the franc, whose high value hurts Switzerland\u2019s export-reliant economy. The strategy is paying off, with the currency losing nearly 9 percent versus the euro last year.  The central bank\u2019s profit was also boosted by buoyant global stock markets. Around 20 percent of its investments are in shares of companies including big stakes in Amazon, Starbucks and Facebook.  Making a profit is not part of the SNB\u2019s mandate, which aims to ensure price stability in Switzerland while paying attention to the country\u2019s economic development. The record profit does not mean a bigger payout for the bank\u2019s 2,200 shareholders. The SNB stuck to a proposed payout of 15 francs per share - the maximum allowed under Swiss law.  The SNB is unusual among central banks in having private shareholders, although most of its shares are held by cantonal banks and the country\u2019s cantons. Its stock price more than doubled last year.  \u201cThe SNB\u2019s dividend may seem quite low when compared to its profits, but the bank was not created to make a profit. It is just a nice side effect,\u201d said Alessandro Bee, an economist at UBS.  But the Swiss federal government and the country\u2019s 26 cantons will get more cash than usual.  In addition to the normal 1 billion francs payout they get, they will share an extra 1 billion francs after the SNB\u2019s distribution reserve exceeded 20 billion francs.  Credit Suisse said the result would help the SNB to defend its expansive monetary policy, which has featured regular currency market interventions to weaken the franc.  \u201cA large profit makes it easier for the SNB to explain why it has built up all these foreign currency reserves than if they reported a loss,\u201d said economist Maxime Botteron.  $1 = 0.9773 Swiss francs\nEditing by Michael Shields"

Abdullah al-Saleh, the ministry\u2019s undersecretary for foreign trade, was speaking at a business conference. Last month, the central bank estimated GDP growth in 2017 at only 1.6 percent, partly because of cuts in oil output under a global deal among producers.  This year, oil output is not expected to be cut further. Saleh also cited government investment in infrastructure projects and growth in foreign trade, which benefits Dubai in particular.  Last October, the International Monetary Fund projected the UAE economy would grow 3.4 percent in 2018. (Reporting by Stanley Carvalho; Writing by Andrew Torchia)"

          "body": "* Yen rises after Bank of Japan trims JGB purchases  * Nikkei probes highest levels since November 1991  * Samsung\u2019s guidance disappoints, weighing on tech sector  * Crude oil futures rise to highest since May 2015  By Lisa Twaronite  TOKYO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Asian shares pared gains on Tuesday, pulling away from the cusp of a record high, while the yen stole the currency spotlight and jumped after the Bank of Japan\u2019s slight reduction to its bond purchases reminded investors that it will eventually normalise policy.  European stock futures were slightly lower, suggesting a subdued opening for the region, with DAX futures slightly higher and FTSE futures up 0.2 percent.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was nearly flat in afternoon trade after earlier rising as high as 591.28, not far from its record peak of 591.50 scaled in November 2007.  South Korea\u2019s share market erased its gains and slipped 0.1 percent, dragged lower by a 3.1 percent drop in shares of Samsung Electronics Co.  Samsung\u2019s guidance fell short of market expectations despite a forecast for a record fourth-quarter profit, as a strong won and one-off staff bonuses took the shine off surging DRAM chip prices.  The MSCI tech index for Asia slipped 0.1 percent, after it had gained more than 5 percent this year.  On Wall Street on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 0.05 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.17 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.29 percent. After the best start to a year in more than a decade, investors turned cautious ahead of earnings.  Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock index added 0.6 percent to close at its highest level since November 1991, catching up to the previous session\u2019s gains as markets reopened after a holiday on Monday.  Against the yen, the dollar erased its early modest gains and fell 0.3 percent to 112.74 following a drop as low as 112.50, after Japan\u2019s central bank trimmed its purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs).  Since it adopted the yield curve control policy in 2016, the BOJ has made similar tweaks to its JGB purchases, which are regarded as mainly technical moves. On Tuesday, it cut its JGB purchases of 10 to 25 years left to maturity and those of 25 to 40 years to maturity by 10 billion yen ($88.39 million) each, from its previous operations for those zones.  While the central bank\u2019s operational adjustments do not usually have an impact on foreign exchange markets, dealers said the timing of the move suggested some players had used it as an excuse to sell the dollar and the euro against the yen.  \u201cMajor central banks around the world have begun to normalise policy, and the BOJ\u2019s adjustments today reminded the market that someday it will, too,\u201d said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust.  The euro edged down 0.1 percent to $1.1960, shy of its nearly four-month high of $1.2089 set on Thursday. Against the yen, it skidded 0.4 percent to 134.81  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rival currencies, edged down slightly to 92.326.  Underpinning the dollar, investors bet on further U.S. interest rate hikes after Friday\u2019s payrolls data did nothing to challenge the outlook for monetary policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve. While job growth slowed more than expected, a pick-up in monthly wages pointed to labour market strength.  \u201cBroadly, viewed in context, it was still a reasonably strong labour market,\u201d said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group of U.S. Bank in Helena, Montana.  \u201cThere was nothing in there to dissuade us from the view that the Fed will move again, appropriately, likely in March,\u201d he said.  But the dollar\u2019s upward momentum was tempered as investors differed on the pace of tightening while U.S. inflation remains relatively cool.  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who is a voting member of the central bank\u2019s policy board, said on Monday that only two increases might be needed in 2018, in light of weak price pressures.  Crude oil prices firmed to their highest since May 2015, as political concerns in some OPEC nations offset projections for higher U.S. oil production.  U.S. crude rose 44 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $62.17 a barrel, while Brent crude added 35 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $68.13.  Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,318.45 an ounce, pulling back from a 3-1/2-month high hit last week.  Editing by Sam Holmes and Jacqueline Wong"

Industrial output jumped 3.4 percent, the strongest increase since September 2009, the statistics office said. This compared with the mid-range forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 1.8 percent.  Seasonally adjusted exports rose by 4.1 percent on the month while vibrant domestic demand pushed up imports by 2.3 percent, separate data from the statistics office showed.  The exports figure beat expectations for a 1.2 percent rise while imports also came in stronger than the forecast for a 0.8 percent increase.  The seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to 22.3 billion euros from 19.9 billion euros in October. The November reading was higher than the Reuters consensus forecast for a surplus of 20.9 billion euros. (Reporting by Michael Nienaber,; editing by Joseph Nasr)"

          "body": "BEIJING, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday offered to open up France to Chinese investment in exchange for greater access to Chinese markets for French companies, warning that existing trade imbalances would lead to protectionism.  Macron is on the second leg of a three-day state visit in China with a delegation of 50 business leaders he hopes will help reduce a 30-billion-euro ($36-billion) trade deficit with China.  \u201cWe have an access to markets which is unbalanced, unsatisfying,\u201d Macron told members of the French and Chinese business community at a start-up incubator in Beijing.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with this responsibly, the first, natural, reaction will be to close up on both sides.\u201d  Macron, who met President Xi Jinping on Monday evening, said the two countries would fall into a lose-lose situation if continued restrictions on foreign firms in China prompted France and Europe to put a brake on Chinese investment in Europe.  \u201cLet\u2019s open up both instead,\u201d Macron said.  Macron is hoping to seal deals, notably in the nuclear, aerospace and agrifood sectors. \u201cWe\u2019re confident we\u2019ll achieve more than symbolic stuff,\u201d a French official said, on condition of anonymity.  French nuclear group Areva is close to signing a commercial deal to build a nuclear reprocessing plant, the official added. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been that close to signing a commercial deal,\u201d the official said.  French banking giant BNP Paribas is also expected to set up a joint venture with a Chinese partner in the consumer credit sector, the same official said.  At the incubator, French engineering firm Fives signed a deal with Chinese online retail giant JD.com, which will set up a logistics centre in France to source French food and luxury products for sale online in China.  JD.com agreed to sell 2 billion euros worth of French products - such as Remy Martin cognac or Evian water - on its website over the next two years.

          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel\u2019s parliament passed legislation governing trading on the Jewish Sabbath by a one-vote margin on Tuesday, a vote that has angered secular lawmakers while earning a reprieve for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition.  The bill, passed by a 58-to-57 vote, affords Israel\u2019s interior minister the right to cancel municipal by-laws that local councils may wish to enact to allow the opening of shops and restaurants in their areas during the Sabbath.  Most, but not all, Jewish-run shops and supermarkets have traditionally remained closed in Israel during the Sabbath, which runs from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday. The number of open establishments varies according to the religious nature of the area.  The legislation, promoted by Interior Minister Aryeh Deri of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, would affect new establishments wishing to open their doors during the Sabbath, but current norms would not be influenced.   Shas and another ultra-Orthodox party have angered Israel\u2019s secular Jewish majority by trying to limit Saturday trading and threatened to leave Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, which could have caused it to collapse had the legislation failed.  The successful vote was the latest of several motions brought by right-wing coalition members who feel able to pressure Netanyahu\u2019s brittle government, which has a slim parliamentary majority, to enact hard-line legislation.  Netanyahu told his Likud faction in parliament on Monday that any vote against the legislation would be a vote of no-confidence in the government. The Israeli leader is also beset by two corruption investigations, in which he denies wrongdoing.  At least one member of his own Likud party refused to vote for the motion and was threatened with expulsion. Members of other coalition factions also refused to vote for it.  Defence Minister Avigdor Liberman, leader of the ultra-nationalist and secularist Yisrael Beitenu faction, said his party would not back the motion and he called the bill \u201cabsurd\u201d.

          "body": "SAO PAULO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Brazil\u2019s rebounding economy and record-low interest rates are likely to change the nature of mergers and acquisitions in 2018 from scandal-driven asset sales to investor bets on a broad recovery, bankers and lawyers in the country said.  Conglomerates under pressure from corruption probes and excessive debt were forced to sell major assets last year, lifting the value of Brazilian M&A to $61.77 billion, up 33 percent from 2016. Bigger transactions drove the increase, as the number of deals fell to 544 from 615 a year before.  Bankers expect a similar volume of deals in Brazil this year, but driven by new motives as Latin America\u2019s largest economy is poised to grow the most in at least five years.  \u201cWe will still see a lot of deals in infrastructure and energy, but the recovery may stimulate acquisitions in retail and consumer industries too,\u201d said Roderick Greenlees, head of investment banking at Ita\u00fa BBA SA, which topped the Thomson Reuters ranking last year in number of deals.  Some of the first deals of 2018 have highlighted a new kind of interest from buyers.  China\u2019s Didi Chuxing announced last week that it was taking control of Brazilian ride-hailing app 99 as part of its expansion in Latin America.  Boeing Co is also in tie-up talks with Brazilian airmaker Embraer SA with an eye on its new regional jets and military airlifter.  By contrast, several of the biggest deals last year involved companies sold by conglomerate J&F Investimentos SA, which agreed to pay the largest-ever leniency fine for its role in political bribery schemes. Its owners, brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, are now in jail.  J&F closed several multibillion deals, such as the sale of dairy company Vigor Alimentos SA to Mexico\u2019s Grupo Lala SAB de CV in August and pulpmaker Eldorado Celulose Brasil SA to Paper Excellence in September.  While deals related to graft investigations are winding down, some large Brazilian groups still need to sell assets and pay down debt, said Leandro Miranda, head of investment banking at Banco Bradesco BBI, the leader in deal value in Brazil last year.  Record-low interest rates this year may favor financial acquirers such as buyout firms instead of strategic investors and M&A deal financing, Miranda added.  Although volatility related to an October presidential election may weigh on capital markets activity, Ita\u00fa BBA\u2019s Greenlees does not expect a significant effect on M&A. Still, he said investors would be watching President Michel Temer\u2019s efforts to streamline social security in order to close a fiscal deficit.  \u201cApproval of pension reform is more important to these long-term investors than the elections,\u201d he said.  The rally of the benchmark Bovespa stock index to a fresh high this week has also boosted valuations to levels that could stimulate more moves like the biggest deal of 2017.  In that transaction, iron ore miner Vale SA migrated to a single class of stock and incorporated its controlling shareholder Valepar SA. The miner intends to become a dispersed ownership company with gradual steps to scrap its shareholders agreement. The boost to corporate governance, isolating the company from government\u2019s influence, lifted its shares about 64 percent last year.  \u201cOther companies that still have this governance gap and are discounted by the market may follow Vale\u2019s lead\u201d, said Alessandro Zema, head of investment banking at Morgan Stanley.

          "body": "* Sees 2017 exports up at least 10 pct  * Says strong baht affects exports, urges c.bank to act  * Says baht at 33-34 per US dollar an appropriate level (Adds details, graphic)  BANGKOK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Thailand\u2019s exports, which shrank for three years before a solid rebound in 2017, are likely to rise 5.5 percent this year, a group of Thai shippers said on Tuesday.  The Thai National Shippers\u2019 Council said exports are climbing ,thanks to improved global demand, but a strong baht is a threat.  For growth, \u201cthis year we have a conservative forecast at 5.5 percent,\u201d Ghanyapad Tantipipatpong, council chairwoman, told a briefing.  Exports, a key driver of Thai growth, shrank for three consecutive ending in 2016.  In the first 11 months of 2017, exports increased 10 percent from a year earlier, according to customs data, even though the baht has strengthened significantly.  The baht, which strengthened about 9 percent in 2017 and hit a 40-month high on Monday, traded at 32.20 per dollar on Tuesday.  The shippers\u2019 council, saying the strong baht has affected exporters, urged the Bank of Thailand (BOT) to take action, including introducing curbs on capital inflows. It plans to meet the central bank on Friday.  The council believes the strong baht cut export revenue by about 350 billion baht ($10.86 billion) in 2017,  Ghanyapad said, without elaborating.  The baht at 33-34 per dollar would be appropriate for the export sector and it should move in line with regional currencies, she added.  The BOT said last week it was ready to intervene if the baht moved too fast and affected the private sector.  However, based on historical data, the baht has had a limited impact on Thailand\u2019s export performance.

          "body": "* NSE edges up 0.1 pct, BSE up 0.26 pct  * Coal India top pct gainer  * Mkt trend largely positive - analyst  By Krishna V Kurup  Jan 9 (Reuters) - Indian shares hit record highs for a third straight session on Tuesday as Coal India Ltd surged after price hikes, but broader gains were capped by losses in IT and financial sectors.  Coal India rose to its highest in 10 months after the company raised prices of non-coking coal across all its units. It expects an incremental revenue of about 19.56 billion rupees ($308 million) for the rest of the current fiscal year.  But caution prevailed ahead of the corporate results season kicking in this week. Tata Consultancy Services is due to post December-quarter results on Thursday, followed by Infosys on Friday.  Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is expected to present the federal budget for the 2018/19 financial year on Feb. 1, amid investor concerns that the government could unveil some populist measures with heavier spending than this year.  \u201cMarkets are flattish as there is some volatility due to expectations around budget, corporate results which are starting soon and the global markets,\u201d said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.  Broadly, the trend is still very positive, he said.  The broader NSE index was up 0.1 percent at 10,633.50 as of 0616 GMT, after rising as much as 0.33 percent to a record of 10,659.15.  The benchmark BSE index rose 0.26 percent to 34,441.64, after gaining as much as 0.39 percent to 34,487.52, its highest ever.  Among the gainers, energy shares advanced the most, with Nifty energy index rising as much as 0.8 percent. Coal India shares gained 6.1 percent and Reliance Industries Ltd rose 1.3 percent.  ITC Ltd rose 1.7 percent and was among the top contributors to the index gains.  Tata Motors Ltd rose 1.7 percent. Its Jaguar Land Rover unit\u2019s sales rose 7 pct to a record 621,109 vehicles in 2017 but said it faced tough conditions in the UK due to weakening consumer confidence and a planned diesel tax rise on new cars.  Information technology stocks were down with TCS falling 0.6 percent and Wipro losing 1 percent.  Meanwhile, iron ore miner NMDC Ltd dropped 3.9 percent after the government unveiled a plan to sell up to 47.5 million shares in the company.

          "body": "MANILA, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of devotees, many barefooted, joined a chaotic procession in the Philippine capital on Tuesday for a black Jesus Christ statue, in one of the biggest annual religious festivals in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation.  The faithful gathered in downtown Manila to follow a carriage bearing the statue called the Black Nazarene, believed to have healing powers, in a parade that began at dawn and may last until evening or even longer.  Men surrounded the carriage that was pulled by ropes, while the crowd waved towels and handkerchiefs in a sign of praise to the life-sized image of Jesus kneeling with a cross on his shoulder.  Processions and other religious rites were also held elsewhere in the country of 105 million people to celebrate the feast.  Citing police estimates, local media said this year\u2019s festivities may draw 17 million devotees nationwide, some seeking healing for illnesses and forgiveness for sins and others expressing gratitude for blessings.  Around 380,000 people were in the Manila procession, based on an early afternoon estimate by police, excluding those waiting elsewhere along the parade route.  Explaining the strong Filipino devotion, Monsignor Sabino Vengco, a prominent Catholic priest, told CNN Philippines: \u201cPeople will suffer sickness, old age...so pain and suffering will always be there,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere will always be a need for someone, and that is exactly Jesus.\u201d  The Philippine Red Cross said it had assisted more than 600 devotees who were feeling unwell, or suffered injuries during the morning part of the parade as the crowd swelled and many clamoured to reach out towards the icon.  More than 4,000 police and soldiers were deployed to ensure the Manila procession would be peaceful, said Oscar Albayalde, the capital\u2019s police chief.

The Australian benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index inched up 0.1 percent to its strongest close in a decade at 6,138. That marked the fifth consecutive session of gains for the benchmark, which rose 0.1 percent on Monday.  Mining giant BHP Billiton climbed 1.7 percent to its strongest in over three years, while Rio Tinto added 2.3 percent to its best in well over six years.  That came as Chinese iron ore futures rose more than 3 percent on Tuesday to their highest in four months as investors reacted to moves by Beijing to tighten up on implementing steel production capacity cutbacks.  Australia\u2019s metals and mining index finished up 1.3 percent at levels touched nearly half a decade ago.  Energy stocks also stoked buying sentiment after U.S. oil prices again hit their highest since 2015 as OPEC-led production cuts inspired betting on further price rises.  Woodside Petroleum and Origin Energy added 0.8 percent and 1.5 percent respectively, scaling levels not seen since August, 2015.  Meanwhile, New Zealand\u2019s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index closed up 0.1 percent, following Monday\u2019s losses of 0.4 percent.  Gains in utilities stocks outweighed losses in industrials.  Power generator Meridian Energy Ltd rose 0.7 percent, while Auckland International Airport Ltd dulled sentiment, losing 1.6 percent.  Ryman Healthcare Ltd was the top climber on the benchmark, touching record levels. But peer Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corp saw its biggest decline in over a month.

Williams canned a 3-pointer with 9.1 seconds left Monday night as the Los Angeles Clippers rallied to hand the Atlanta Hawks their latest loss, a 108-107 decision at Staples Center in Los Angeles.  Williams\u2019 game-winning shot came after Wesley Johnson grabbed an offensive rebound off Lou Williams\u2019 missed 3-pointer. It capped a rally from a 105-100 deficit after Kent Bazemore made a free throw with 1:26 remaining for Atlanta.  Playing percentages, the Hawks (10-30) opted to foul DeAndre Jordan on the Clippers\u2019 next two possessions. But Jordan, a notoriously terrible foul shooter who has improved to 60.6 percent this season, drained four straight free throws to pull Los Angeles (18-21) within a point.  Jawun Evans sank a foul shot with 1:05 remaining to even the score at 105, but Bazemore responded by drilling two free throw with 23.2 seconds left to give Atlanta a two-point edge. However, the Hawks couldn\u2019t make a final stop and dropped their fourth straight game.  Lou Williams led all scorers with 34 points, while Jordan finished with a 25-point, 18-rebound double-double. C.J. Williams scored 15, Evans 13 and reserve guard Tyrone Wallace added 11 points.  Taurean Prince paced Atlanta with 20 points, but missed a potential go-ahead jumper with 3.9 seconds remaining. The Hawks grabbed the offensive rebound but weren\u2019t able to get off another shot before time expired.  Dennis Schroder netted 18, while Bazemore and Ersan Ilyasova scored 13 points each. Ilyasova grabbed 13 rebounds for a double-double. Marco Belinelli added 10 points off the bench.  Los Angeles never trailed in the first half, opening up a 32-25 advantage after one quarter and expanding it to 15 when Lou Williams dunked at the 3:43 mark of the second quarter. The Clippers settled for a 58-47 lead at the half.  They still led by 13 with five minutes left in the third quarter after Williams stroked a 3-pointer. At that point, Atlanta made its move, ripping off a 16-6 run to end the period. The Hawks entered the fourth quarter trailing just 80-77.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "EditorsNote: Adds Saban quotes  True freshman Tua Tagovailoa hit DeVonta Smith with a 41-yard touchdown pass in overtime early Tuesday morning, giving Alabama a dramatic 26-23 win over Georgia in the championship game of the College Football Playoff at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.  \u201cThe resiliency of this team to come through in the second half ... I\u2019m so proud of our players to come back after the first half we played wasn\u2019t very good,\u201d Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said.  The Bulldogs (13-2) got the ball first in overtime and took a three-point lead on a 51-yard field goal by Rodrigo Blankenship. After Tagovailoa was sacked for a 16-yard loss on first down, he found Smith wide open down the left side for the play that turned him into an instant legend in Alabama.  Alabama forced overtime when Tagovailoa hit Calvin Ridley for a 7-yard touchdown pass on a 4th-down play with 3:49 remaining, capping its rally from a 13-point halftime deficit.  The Crimson Tide had a chance to win it at the end of regulation, but Andy Pappanastos pulled a 36-yard field goal try wide left as time expired. It was his first miss in 14 career attempts of 36 yards or shorter.  Blankenship finished 14- and 13-play drives with 41 and 27-yard field goals for a 6-0 Georgia lead with 7:33 left in the second quarter. The Bulldogs made it a 13-0 game at halftime when wide receiver Mecole Hardman took a direct snap and scored on a 1-yard run with seven seconds remaining.  Saban told his quarterbacks at halftime that he was going make the switch from Jalen Hurts to Tagovailoa and see how that impacted the offense.  \u201cI just thought we needed to throw the ball in the game, and I thought he could do it better,\u201d Saban said of the true freshman out of Hawaii.  Tagovailoa had seen only mop-up duty through the course of the regular season until being thrown into the spotlight in the national title game.  \u201cI found out when we were in the locker room,\u201d Tagovailoa said. \u201cCoach brought the quarterbacks together and made the statement that, \u2018Tua, you\u2019re going to start the second half and we\u2019re going to rotate the quarterbacks ... see how things go. And we went from there.\u201d  The move to Tagovailoa paid dividends on his second possession. He led a seven-play, 56-yard drive that ended with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Henry Ruggs with 8:52 left in the third quarter.  Georgia responded exactly two minutes later with a stunning score. Freshman Jake Fromm heaved a bomb down the right sideline for Hardman, who made the catch, eluded a tackle and tight-roped 80 yards to the end zone for a 20-7 advantage.  Pappanastos brought Alabama within 20-13 with 43 and 30-yard field goals, giving Tagovailoa the chance to play the hero\u2019s role.  Tagovailoa started the second half and completed 14 of 24 passes for 166 yards and three touchdowns with an interception. Fromm was 16 of 32 for 232 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.  It was the sixth national championship for Saban, tying him with Bear Bryant for the most in the bowl era. This one denied the Bulldogs their first national title since 1980.  \u201cIt\u2019s not just about winning a championship,\u201d Saban said. \u201cEvery team wants to be successful and as a coach, you want to see them reach their full potential. But as a college coach, and the thing that I like about college coaching, you have an opportunity to affect people.  \u201cThe message to the team tonight after this game? \u2018I hope that you take something from this game, and the resiliency that you showed in this game, and it helps you be more successful in life. So, it\u2019s not just about winning a championship.\u201d  Georgia coach Kirby Smart, a former assistant under Saban, said he expected the Crimson Tide to make a switch at quarterback coming out of halftime.  \u201cWe\u2019d seen him on tape,\u201d Smart said. \u201cWe told everyone at halftime that there was no question that they were going to him. Because they were struggling and they needed some momentum.  \u201cHe provided them some juice, and got them some momentum. He\u2019s a good player.\u201d  Hurts was engaged on the sideline throughout the second half, talking with coaches and encouraging Tagovailoa.  \u201cHe was going to step in and do his thing,\u201d Hurts said when asked what his thoughts were when Saban told him of the quarterback change at halftime. \u201cWe have a lot of guys in the QB room that play really well. He stepped in and did his thing ... did his thing for the team. He\u2019s built for stuff like this, he has that impact. I\u2019m so happy for him and so happy for this team.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "title": "GM races to build a formula for profitable electric cars",
          "body": "DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra has made a bold promise to investors that the Detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021.  What Barra has not explained in detail is how GM intends to do what, so far, no major automaker has done.  The answer is a big bet on combining proprietary battery technology, a low-cost, flexible vehicle design and high-volume production mainly in China, according to six current and former GM and supplier executives and six industry experts interviewed by Reuters.   If GM can meet Barra\u2019s ambitious profitability target, then it will house two different businesses by the mid-2020s: A traditional focus in North America on trucks, sport utility vehicles and cars fueled with petroleum, and a global electric car company centered in China, branching into pay-per-use services such as robotaxis.    Barra\u2019s promise to turn a profit is a bold claim in a market segment that has been driven more by government policy than consumer demand, and where Tesla Inc - the world\u2019s largest electric-vehicle manufacturer - is burning through more than $1 billion in cash each quarter selling premium-priced vehicles.  Barra and GM have invested heavily in the electrification strategy, and worked during the past year to persuade investors that GM can compete with Tesla by building on the success of the automaker\u2019s latest electric vehicle, the Chevrolet Bolt EV, and cutting costs along the way.   A key element of the plan, according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s strategy, is slashing the amount of cobalt in GM\u2019s new EMC 1.0 battery system. The price of cobalt \u2013  the single most costly ingredient in current lithium-ion battery cells - has soared in the past two years in expectation of a surge in demand from automakers. Cobalt prices hit a record high this month on the London Metal Exchange.  GM\u2019s new battery design increases the amount of nickel, which enables batteries to store and produce more energy, these people told Reuters.  GM engineers are also working on other design and technological advances, according to executives and company patent filings, including more efficient packaging of batteries in vehicles and improved systems for managing energy flow and cooling the battery cells.   Without providing details, GM has said it expects these changes to cut the cost of battery cells by more than 30 percent, from $145 per kilowatt-hour to less than $100 by 2021.   Battery experts said the full cost of a GM battery pack, such as the one used now in the Bolt EV, is $10,000-$12,000, or nearly one-third of the car\u2019s $36,000 sticker price.  By 2021, however, that price could drop to $6,000, according to consultant Jon Bereisa, a former GM engineering director who helped develop the Chevrolet Volt hybrid and spearheaded much of the automaker\u2019s early lithium-ion battery development.  With improvements in battery chemistry and packaging, Bereisa said, the next-generation Bolt \u201ccould deliver a 45-percent increase in range for about the same (battery) pack cost, or the same range at 45 percent less pack cost.\u201d  Pam Fletcher, vice president in charge of GM\u2019s global electric vehicle programs, and other GM executives would not comment on specifics of the new battery system, which is slated to be introduced in 2020-2021.   To be sure, electric vehicles account for only a small fraction of global auto sales. Like other manufacturers, GM is banking not only on reducing its own costs and improving vehicle performance, but also on increased demand driven by higher government-mandated electric vehicle quotas in China that are intended to help reduce pollution and the country\u2019s dependence on petroleum.  In addition to improving battery and vehicle design and performance, GM is working with Chinese partner SAIC to reduce the cost of assembling electric cars. Sources said GM and SAIC are designing dedicated electric vehicle factories in China that are far smaller, less complex and more efficient than a conventional car plant.      GM has more capital for electric vehicle development because of Barra\u2019s decisions to sell money-losing European operations, exit other unprofitable markets and invest in a new generation of highly profitable, petroleum-fueled large pickup trucks, launching later in 2018.        The automaker now has more than 1,700 engineers, designers and researchers working on batteries and electric vehicles, many of them at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, where the company opened a dedicated battery research center in 2009, a week after it filed for bankruptcy reorganization.   Automotive experts say GM\u2019s battery and EV group is one of the largest in the world, rivaled only by Toyota Motor Corp in Japan and Daimler AG in Germany.   Toyota has patented more battery technology in recent years than GM, although its focus has been mainly the Prius family of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, rather than on pure battery-powered cars like GM\u2019s Bolt EV.   GM was issued 661 U.S. patents on battery technology from 2010 through 2015, the latest that such data is available from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, trailing only Toyota\u2019s 762 battery patents among global automakers.   For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2CHPWnx  In addition to the battery work, GM engineers are developing a new dedicated \u201cplug and play\u201d structure for its next-generation electric vehicles that is flexible and modular, meaning it will be able to accommodate battery systems of different sizes, as well as hydrogen fuel cells, one of the sources said.  In an interview, Mark Reuss, head of global product development, said GM\u2019s strategy to reduce battery cost is not tied to a single improvement such as a change in battery chemistry, but rather a series of continuous enhancements in battery technology and packaging.  \u201cThere are no silver bullets here,\u201d Reuss said. GM also has not solved all the problems required to achieve its goal, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018product development\u2019 for a reason,\u201d he said.  The most recent developments and enhancements in battery technology have not been made public, according to GM\u2019s Fletcher.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that we choose not to patent because we don\u2019t want to make it visible\u201d before the new technology goes into production, Fletcher told Reuters.  GM\u2019s patent history since 2010 shows a focus on improvements in battery technology, packaging and processing, some of them designed to help boost the battery\u2019s energy and extend vehicle range between charges, according to company filings.  GM jointly developed its current battery know-how with Korea\u2019s LG Group, which makes batteries and electronic components for the Bolt. Introduced in October 2016, Bolt was the first mass-produced electric vehicle to go more than 200 miles between charges, and sell at a sticker price of under $40,000. GM sold 23,297 Bolts in 2017.   Tesla reported producing just 1,770 of its $35,000 Model 3 sedans in 2017, well short of the company\u2019s original targets.   The launch of the Bolt and its warm reception by reviewers, customers and investors was a watershed event for Barra and GM\u2019s top management.  \u201cIt was a \u2018holy shit\u2019 moment that made us rethink what might be possible,\u201d said one GM insider.

          "body": "TOKYO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices dipped on Tuesday, with yields on 20 to 40-year bonds hitting one-month highs, after the Bank of Japan reduced its buying in those maturities over 10 years.  The BOJ trimmed the amount it bought in Japanese government bonds of 10 to 25 years left to maturity and those of 25 to 40 years to maturity by 10 billion yen ($88.39 million) each from its previous operations.  Since it adopted the yield curve control policy in 2016, the BOJ has occasionally tweaked its bond operations, with officials saying any changes are meant to keep bond yields in line with its policy goal and not to telegraph hints on its future policy.  While Tuesday\u2019s move was in line with slow and subtle reduction in its bond buying - which many market players call \u2018stealth tapering\u2019 - the timing took some players by surprise.  \u201cGiven that those maturities have become expensive on the yield curve, a cut in buying could happen any moment,\u201d said Ryoko Tada, fixed income analyst at Nomura Securities.  \u201c But on the other hand, the BOJ could have done so back in December (when their yields were lower), so in that sense it was a bit of surprise,\u201d she said.  The benchmark 10-year JGB yield rose 1.0 basis point to 0.065 percent, its highest level in more than two weeks while the 20-year yield went up 1.0 basis point to 0.585 percent, a one-month high.  The 30-year yield rose 1.5 basis point to one-month high  of 0.830 percent.  The price of the 10-year JGB futures dipped 0.10 point to 150.62 by late afternoon trade.  The five-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to minus 0.095 percent. (Reporting by Tokyo Markets Team; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)"

          "body": "YANGON (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s envoy to Myanmar has raised concerns about the arrest of two Reuters journalists in a letter to the country\u2019s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, describing the situation as \u201cserious intimidation\u201d and calling for their immediate release.  The Reuters journalists, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12. They are being investigated on suspicion of breaching the Official Secrets Act, a little-used law that dates from the days of British colonial rule.  They had worked on coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where a military crackdown that followed militant attacks on security forces in August led to an exodus of more than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to refugee camps in Bangladesh.   The two are due to appear in court on Wednesday. It will be their second appearance in court and the prosecutor could request that charges are filed against them.  \u201cThis situation amounts to a serious intimidation against journalists in general and from Reuters in particular,\u201d said  Kristian Schmidt, representative in Yangon of the EU\u2019s 28 states, said in the letter dated Jan. 8.  \u201cJournalists should ... be able to work in a free and enabling environment without fear of intimidation or undue arrest or prosecution,\u201d he said.   \u201cWe therefore call on your government to provide the necessary legal protection for these two journalists, to ensure the full respect of their fundamental rights and to release them immediately.\u201d  Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were detained after they were invited to meet police for dinner in Yangon.   The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying they were \u201carrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces\u201d. It said they had \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media\u201d.  Government officials from some of the world\u2019s major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for their release.  Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the two.  \u201cAs they near their hearing date, it remains entirely clear that they are innocent of any wrongdoing,\u201d Adler said in a statement on Monday.  Authorities have blocked access to media seeking to cover the military crackdown in the north of Rakhine State. The United Nations has condemned the military campaign there as ethnic cleansing, a charge Buddhist-majority Myanmar has rejected.  Writing by John Chalmers; Editing by Martin Howell"

Journalists Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12.

Last week, a government spokesman, when asked about a campaign of support for the two reporters on social media, said people should not undertake such efforts while a case was being heard in court.  Thant Zin Soe said he did not want to comment on the circumstances of the reporters\u2019 arrest, except to say: \u201cIt\u2019s not a good thing to hear that a reporter got arrested when he was doing his job.  \u201cWe\u2019re marching towards democracy, it\u2019s not a good thing for the democratization process.\u201d       Reporting by Reuters Television; Writing by Robert Birsel; Editing by Alex Richardson"

          "body": "Stephen Curry contributed 32 points and nine assists and the Golden State Warriors exacted a measure of revenge against the Denver Nuggets with a 124-114 victory on Monday in Oakland, Calif.  Draymond Green had 23 points and 10 assists and Klay Thompson scored 19 points as Golden State won its fifth straight game and improved its NBA-best record to 33-8. The Warriors shot 56.5 percent from the field despite being without forward Kevin Durant for the third straight game due to a calf injury.  Golden State endured its worst offensive showing of the season on Dec. 23 against the Nuggets when it lost 96-81 and shot 38.1 percent from the field, including a 3-of-27 showing from 3-point range.  Nikola Jokic had 22 points, 12 rebounds and a season-high 11 assists for his first triple-double of the season for the Nuggets. Gary Harris finished with 22 points and Trey Lyles and Jamal Murray added 21 points apiece for Denver, which lost for the fourth time in the last six contests.  Denver tied the score at 69 on a dunk by Mason Plumlee with 6:57 left in the third quarter before Golden State used an 11-2 burst to take a nine-point lead. Curry knocked down a 3-pointer for a 14-point advantage with just under a minute remaining and the Warriors ended up taking a 93-81 lead into the fourth quarter.  Shaun Livingston\u2019s basket increased Golden State\u2019s lead to 110-92 with 7:48 remaining. The Nuggets pulled within six points with 1:26 remaining before Green scored on a layup and added two free throws to push the margin back to 10 as the Warriors closed it out.  Curry and Green each had 13 first-half points as the Warriors took a 64-57 halftime lead.  Golden State\u2019s offense clicked from the outset and Thompson\u2019s basket provided a 24-14 advantage just 5:03 into the contest. Thompson had nine in the quarter as the Warriors opened up a 37-28 lead.  Livingston\u2019s basket early in the second quarter gave Golden State a 13-point edge, and the margin was again 13 when Thompson drained a 3-pointer to make it 52-39 with 5:15 remaining in the half. Denver closed strong to trail by seven at the break.  \u2014Field Level Media"
