          "body": "In a battle of the NHL\u2019s worst road power play against its worst home penalty kill, the power play won.  Scoring three man-advantage markers in a 2:58 span early in the third period, the Los Angeles Kings turned a close game into a rout and blanked the Edmonton Oilers 5-0 Tuesday night at Rogers Place in Edmonton, Alberta.  The teams played 40 minutes of tight hockey. Only a rare Andy Andreoff goal, his second of the season, at 14:21 of the second period separated the teams.  Then Patrick Maroon delivered a hit to the head of defenseman Drew Doughty at 19:55 of the second period, earning a five-minute major and a game misconduct. Los Angeles (24-11-5) took full advantage when the final 20 minutes started.  Trevor Lewis beat goalie Cam Talbot at 1:36, his ninth goal of the season, with Tyler Toffoli and Marian Gaborik assisting.  Dustin Brown made it 3-0 with a rebound tally at 3:59, scoring on a backhander for his 14th goal. Adrian Kempe scored 35 seconds later, collecting the rebound of a side shot by Gaborik and bagging his 12th tally of the season.  Prior to that outburst, the Kings scored just three power-play goals in their previous 14 games.  \u201cWe played solid,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOur power play has not been great, but it\u2019s not about the percentage, it\u2019s about getting key goals at key times.\u201d  Brown tacked on his second goal of the night at 18:28 with a wrister from the right circle, enabling him to surpass his goal total from last season. Kopitar skated through three Edmonton defenders and zipped a cross-ice pass to Brown, setting up the final tally.  The Oilers (17-20-3) took their fourth consecutive loss, including their second consecutive 5-0 setback, and they remain eight points out of the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.  Jonathan Quick (19-11-2) stopped all 32 shots he faced for his third shutout of the season. Talbot (14-12-2) made 28 saves.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "title": "China's yuan weakens after strong official fixing",
          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China\u2019s yuan eased against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday after the central bank set the daily midpoint at its strongest level in 20 months, prompting a rush of dollar buying by corporates.  Prior to market opening on Wednesday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set its official yuan midpoint CNY=PBOC at 6.4920 per dollar, breaching the key threshold 6.5 per dollar level.  Wednesday\u2019s official midpoint was 159 pips, or 0.24 percent, firmer than Tuesday\u2019s fix of 6.5079 and was the strongest since May 3, 2016.  In the spot market, the onshore yuan CNY=CFXS opened at 6.4988 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.5057 at midday, 108 pips weaker than the previous late session close and 0.21 percent softer than the midpoint.   Traders said corporate demand for the greenback emerged after the spot yuan rate strengthened to below 6.5 per dollar.  A Shanghai-based trader at a foreign bank said overall market sentiment remained cautious as the market had no strong expectations for the yuan\u2019s trend.  State-run Securities Times warned against \u201cover-inflated\u201d expectations for the yuan in a front-page commentary on Wednesday.   \u201cCurrently, the yuan exchange rate is strengthening to approach a high it reached in September ... Should the yuan continue to rise? Obviously, it requires the central bank to release some signal to stabilise (the Chinese currency),\u201d the newspaper said, reinforcing that the 6.5 per dollar level remained \u201ca key threshold\u201d.  The newspaper also said a continued rise in the yuan would hurt exports and stimulate speculation in the foreign exchange market.   Multiple traders said they did not expect any policy to be taken out to stabilise the yuan any time soon as the market was already very stable.  The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index .RXYH, which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, stood at 95.76, weaker than the previous day\u2019s 95.93.   The global dollar index .DXY rose to 91.917 from the previous close of 91.872.   The offshore yuan was trading 0.01 percent firmer than the onshore spot at 6.505 per dollar.   Offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts (NDFs)CNY1YNDFOR=, considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations of the yuan\u2019s value, traded at 6.6395, 2.22 percent weaker than the midpoint.  One-year NDFs are settled against the midpoint, not the spot rate.  Reporting by Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch; editing by Simon Cameron-Moore"

          "body": "Charlotte forward Nicolas Batum scored 21 points, and center Dwight Howard had 20 as the Hornets rolled to a 131-111 victory over the Sacramento Kings at the Golden 1 Center on Tuesday.  Jeremy Lamb and Johnny O\u2019Bryant III each had 16 points, and Kemba Walker contributed 12 points and 10 assists for the Hornets (14-23). Charlotte shot 57.3 percent from the field and coasted after building a 20-point halftime lead that grew to 23 late in the third quarter.  Batum and Lamb made three 3-pointers apiece as the Hornets sank 15 of 32 from long distance. Marvin Williams, O\u2019Bryant and Frank Kaminksy had two apiece.  Zach Randolph finished with 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Skal Labissiere had 17 points and 15 rebounds for Sacramento, which has lost three straight home games since beating the Cleveland Cavaliers last Wednesday. The Kings (12-25) have lost five of six.  The Kings shot 51.7 percent from the floor and had a 47-30 rebounding advantage but could not overcome Charlotte\u2019s 3-point efficiency and precision ball-handling. The Hornets committed only three turnovers, while the Kings turned the ball over 15 times.  Charlotte posted a season high in points, two more than it had in an overtime victory over the Washington Wizards on Nov. 22.  Kings rookie guard De\u2019Aaron Fox, the fifth player taken in the 2017 draft, had 17 points and four assists in 33 minutes. He started in his first appearance since Dec. 19, having recovered from a partial tear in his right quad. He had missed six games in a row and seven of eight, playing only 11 minutes in that Dec. 19 contest against the Philadelphia 76ers.  Kaminsky scored 12 points for Charlotte, which is 6-14 since Nov. 24.  Howard had 13 points in the first half, one of four Hornets in double figures at halftime, as Charlotte rolled to a 72-52 lead.  Williams had two of the Hornets\u2019 six 3-pointers in the final eight minutes of the first half, which Charlotte closed on a 33-14 run.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Junior center Jessie Govan produced 25 points, 12 rebounds and 5 assists and junior forward Leon Derrickson added 24 points as Georgetown held off DePaul for a 90-81 Big East victory Tuesday night at Wintrust Arena.  Georgetown (11-3, 1-2), which entered the night having played the nation\u2019s easiest non-conference schedule by a wide margin according to KenPom.com, used an 11-0 run midway through the second half to squelch a Blue Demons rally.  DePaul (7-8, 0-3) remained one of two winless teams in Big East play despite 19 points from junior forward Max Strus and 18 apiece from graduate transfer center Marin Maric and senior forward Tre\u2019Darius McCallum. Junior guard Eli Cain handed out a career-high 10 assists.  DePaul forced Ewing to take a timeout less than three minutes into the night as the Blue Demons beat the careless Hoyas down the floor for back-to-back dunks by Maric and sophomore guard Brandon Cyrus to take a 7-2 lead.  Georgetown\u2019s timeout paved the way for a pair of quick runs sparked by Derrickson\u2019s long-range touch. When he swished two 3-pointers in 61 seconds, the Hoyas owned a 19-11 lead at the 13:14 mark.  Though Derrickson didn\u2019t shoot again from beyond the arc, his teammates stayed hot from 3-point range to build a 46-37 halftime lead. The Hoyas shot 7 of 13 on 3s in the first half, including a pair from freshman guard Jahvon Blair.  DePaul produced several mini-runs during the second half to threaten Georgetown, but the Blue Demons could never deliver the go-ahead basket. When Maric filled the lane on a fast break and flew in for a dunk on a McCallum feed, DePaul pulled within 61-60 with 9:44 to go and Maric waved his arms to exhort the home crowd to get loud.  DePaul earned a defensive stop and set up an open shot to take its first lead since the opening four minutes, but freshman point guard Justin Roberts\u2019 18-footer banged off the rim. Derrickson was fouled on the rebound and sank two free throws to trigger an 11-0 Hoyas run that featured two more Derrickson free throws when demonstrative DePaul coach Dave Leitao received a technical with 7:28 left.  DePaul made another run and got as close as 84-79 with 54 seconds left, but Govan produced whenever the Hoyas needed down the stretch. He scored 17 in the second half to earn his 10th double-double of the season and ensure Georgetown didn\u2019t squander late leads as it did in overtime losses to Syracuse and Butler.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Asking and effective rents increased 0.6 percent in the quarter, compared with the third quarter, registering the highest quarterly growth rate in six quarters. Rent growth was 1.8 percent for 2017.  \u201cThe year-end numbers showed a consistent deceleration in occupancy but somewhat higher rent and employment growth than in previous quarters. We expect this trend to continue at the start of 2018 as more office construction is expected to come on line,\u201d Barbara Denham, senior economist at Reis, said in a statement.  Denham believes businesses may feel renewed confidence in 2018 as the recently passed tax bill should return more profits to their bottom lines.  \u201cThis could foster more robust leasing activity.

Net absorption, which is measured in terms of available office space sold in the market during a certain time period, plummeted about 60 percent to 5.21 million square feet in the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier.

All of the injuries, which included adults and children, were non-life-threatening, according to Daniel Nigro, commissioner of the Fire Department of New York.   \u201cOur units arrived and were immediately faced with heavy fire. Numerous people were brought out of the building by the firefighters on scene,\u201d Nigro said during a news conference. \u201cThey\u2019ve all been transported and they will all be OK, thankfully.\u201d   The seven-alarm fire broke out at about 5:30 a.m. local time in a four-story brick structure with a furniture store on the ground floor, fire officials said on Twitter.  More than 200 firefighters battled the blaze in frigid temperatures as low as 13 Fahrenheit (minus 10.6 Celsius) for hours before getting it under control around 2 p.m. EST.  The cause of the fire was yet to be determined.   Later on Tuesday, three fire fighters suffered non-life threatening injuries as they battled a blaze in a three-story building in the borough of Brooklyn, local media reported.   Last Thursday, 12 people, including four children, were killed in the New York City\u2019s deadliest blaze in a quarter of a century in another part of the Bronx less than 2 miles (3 km) away. That fire was caused by a 3-year-old boy playing with the burners of a kitchen stove in one of the apartments, officials said.

          "body": "Erik Johnson\u2019s goal with 10 seconds left in overtime gave the Colorado Avalanche a 3-2 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Tuesday night at the Pepsi Center in Denver.  Just when it looked like the game was headed to a shootout, Johnson beat Connor Hellebuyck on a wrist shot. The goal was Johnson\u2019s sixth of the season.  The Avalanche posted their third straight win and improved to 20-16-3. Meanwhile, the Jets (23-11-7) saw their win streak end at three games.  The winning goal came after Jets captain Blake Wheeler\u2019s second goal of the game with 33 seconds left in the third period created a 2-2 tie. Mikko Rantanen scored a goal and assisted on both of Colorado\u2019s other goals. Nathan MacKinnon added a goal and an assist for the Avs, who were outshot 43-26 by the Jets.  Hellebuyck made his fourth consecutive start for the Jets in goal, while the Avalanche countered with Semyon Varlamov. However, Varlamov left the game in the second period due to an undisclosed injury, and backup Jonathan Bernier finished and collected the win while stopping 20 of 22 shots.  MacKinnon opened the scoring on a wrist shot from the slot at 7:44 of the second period after the Avs dug the puck out of the corner. With the marker, he exceeded the 16 goals that he mustered in all of 2016-17 while playing a full 82-game season. The Avs have slightly more than half a season \u2014 43 games \u2014 left on their schedule.  Just under four minutes later, Rantanen converted a pass from MacKinnon to give the Avs a 2-0 advantage.  The Avs lost Varlamov with 5:45 left in the second period as he departed while Colorado was about to serve a bench minor for too many men on the ice. He was replaced by Bernier, who preserved the hosts two-goal advantage after 40 minutes.  However, Wheeler beat Bernier on a power play only 47 seconds into the third period, cutting the Jets\u2019 deficit in half, before he scored again in the dying moments of regulation time.  Defenseman Dustin Byfuglien returned to the Jets\u2019 lineup after missing 10 games with an undisclosed lower-body injury. He was injured in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Dec. 9. As a result, D Tucker Poolman was scratched.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Booker made three free throws for a 102-101 lead when he was fouled on a 3-point attempt from the right wing with 12.3 seconds remaining. Kent Bazemore, who claimed he got all ball, was charged with the foul.

A mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow is forecast to fall in an area from northern Florida to South Carolina from Tuesday night, which could snarl transport.   Blizzards are possible across portions of eastern New England from late Thursday, where some areas could see 12 to 15 inches (30-38 cm) of snow, the National Weather Service (NWS) said, adding an arctic air mass will remain entrenched over the eastern two thirds of the country through the end of the week.  Late on Tuesday, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 28 counties after the National Weather Service issued the winter storm warning.  Boston tied a 100-year-old record on Tuesday when it marked seven consecutive days of temperatures that did not top 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-6.7 degrees Celsius). Up and down the coast, people working outdoors struggled with the frigid conditions.  In New York City, Nayarit Delgrado, who promotes Times Square\u2019s Madame Tussauds wax museum by handing out discount cards to tourists, said her secret to enduring long days outdoors was resisting the urge to check the temperature on her mobile phone.  \u201cI just don\u2019t want to know,\u201d said the 40-year-old Bronx resident, who said she was bundled up in layers and tugged back a cuff at her wrist to reveal a rainbow of sleeves.  Officials urged people across the northeast to alert social services if they saw people in jeopardy because of the cold.   \u201cWe want every resident to have shelter and warmth,\u201d Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said on Twitter.  The major winter storm is expected to bring snow, ice, rain, strong winds, and tidal flooding to coastal locations from the southeast to New England into Thursday, the NWS said adding, \u201chazardous travel is likely.\u201d  The weather service has issued a winter storm warning from northern Florida to North Carolina.  Florida Governor Rick Scott on Tuesday urged residents in the northern part of the \u201cSunshine State\u201d to prepare for the cold. His office said cold weather shelters have opened or are planning to open in 22 of the state\u2019s 67 counties.  In Texas, where two deaths have been linked to cold gripping large parts of the state, the frigid temperatures were expected to linger overnight, with a warm front moving in from Wednesday afternoon.  School districts in Iowa, Massachusetts, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina canceled or delayed classes. Water in a 750,000-gallon water tower in Evansdale, Iowa, froze for the first time, Mayor Doug Faas said in a telephone interview.     The cold was blamed for six deaths in Wisconsin, West Virginia, North Dakota and Michigan, where a Detroit man was believed to have frozen to death in front of a church, according to police and media reports from the localities.  But in many parts of Alaska, a state known for its harsh winters, the weather was unseasonably warm. On Tuesday, temperatures in Anchorage equaled a record daily high of 44 Fahrenheit (6.7 Celsius).  The warm spell that melted ice and snow forced sporting officials to use snow-making machines to cover a course with a blanket of the white stuff for the U.S. cross-country skiing national championships in the Anchorage area.

James Palmer Jr. added 18 points, including 15 in the second half, and Isaac Copeland had 13 points and eight rebounds for the Cornhuskers, who snapped a four-game losing streak against the Wildcats.  Nebraska (11-5, 2-1 Big Ten) shot 59.3 after halftime while holding Northwestern to 29.2 percent from the field. The Cornhuskers outscored the Wildcats 34-22 in the paint despite losing the rebounding battle 42-36.  Palmer shot 6-of-7 from the field in the second half while the rest of the Cornhuskers shot 50 percent, outscoring the Wildcats 45-25 after halftime.  Northwestern (10-6, 1-2) got 17 points and 15 rebounds from Dererk Pardon, who grabbed a career-high 11 offensive rebounds, but played without starting point guard Byrant McIntosh, who strained his knee in Saturday\u2019s 95-73 win over Brown.  Jordan Ash started in place of the injured McIntosh, who averages 13.3 points per game and a team-best 5.5 assists per game, but was ineffective, finishing with just two points and one assist in 28 minutes.  The Wildcats led 30-25 at halftime thanks to 10-2 run to close the first half. Aaron Falzon hit a 3-pointer with 43 seconds remaining, and Scottie Lindsey followed by hitting his first 3-pointer of the game with five seconds left, giving the Wildcats their largest lead of the half.  Lindsey finished with 12 points and a team-high four assists, but shot just 4-of-14 from the field. Falzon added 11 points while shooting 3-of-5 from 3-point range, but fouled out with 2:48 remaining.  Nebraska turned up its defensive intensity in the second half, and Northwestern looked out of sync offensively without McIntosh. The Wildcats shot 3-of-17 to start the second half and could not shake the slump, shooting 26.9 percent for the half.  Both teams struggled with foul trouble and entered the bonus with 8:35 remaining.

(Reuters) - In the four months since the Myanmar military began a crackdown after Rohingya militants attacked an army base and police posts on Aug. 25, around 655,000 members of the stateless Muslim minority have fled the western state of Rakhine and crossed into neighbouring Bangladesh.  A Reuters graphic makes use of data from the U.N. Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) to show hundreds of villages in Rakhine state that were once inhabited by the Rohingya, but have now been burned down.  A total of 354 villages have either been completely or partially destroyed, Human Rights Watch said on Dec. 18.  The data, which was gathered from Aug. 25, the day of the Rohingya militant attack, to Nov. 25, shows burned settlements in an area stretching 110 km (68 miles) from the green hills of Rakhine\u2019s northern tip to beaches near the state\u2019s capital Sittwe in the south.  See the interactive graphic here: tmsnrt.rs/2zGVUmt  Top officials in the United Nations and United States have described the Myanmar military\u2019s crackdown as ethnic cleansing.  Myanmar has denied human rights abuses, saying its military is engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. The military exonerated itself of all accusations of atrocities in an internal investigation, which published its findings on Nov. 13. Myanmar\u2019s civilian government has said that the burnings were carried out by Rohingya militants and the Rohingya themselves.  Myanmar\u2019s military did not respond to Reuters\u2019 questions about its role in the alleged atrocities against the Rohingya described in this graphic.

The Red Raiders never trailed and effectively showed they could become a Big 12 contender while snapping a 16-game losing streak against the Jayhawks with their first win in 18 tries at Allen Fieldhouse.  The loss was only the 12th at home for 15th-year Kansas coach Bill Self, but the Jayhawks second at home this season after falling earlier to Arizona State.  After trailing 43-32 at halftime, the Jayhawks (11-3, 1-1 Big 12) cut the lead to six, but could not make it a two-possession game down the stretch.  A three-point play on a dunk by freshman guard Zhaire Smith was the punctuation mark, giving the Red Raiders (13-1, 2-0) an 81-71 lead with 1:10 left. The win was their seventh straight coming off a 24-point win over Baylor to open league play.  Junior forward Norense Odiase added 12 points and led Texas Tech with eight rebounds as it managed a 44-29 advantage on the boards. Freshman guard Jarrett Culver and senior guard Justin Gray added 12 points each for the Red Raiders, while Smith chipped in 11.  Senior guard Devonte\u2019 Graham did as much as he could to avert the upset, leading Kansas with game-highs of 27 points and six assists, but he committed five turnovers.  Gray scored the first eight points for the Red Raiders and had 12 at halftime on 5-for-6 shooting, as well as five rebounds.  The Red Raiders used a 23-13 advantage on the glass and an 8-0 edge in second-chance points to build a 43-32 halftime margin. They surged to a 16-point lead, 23-7, with 10:45 showing after capitalizing on five misses in five possessions by Kansas.  The Tech defense also exerted authority early, forcing 10 first-half turnovers, including many unforced mistakes by the Jayhawks. Kansas turned the ball over twice under its own basket on sloppy inbounds passes that led to easy baskets for the Red Raiders.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jack Ma made early friends with Donald Trump. He visited the U.S. president-elect almost a year ago to tout how his e-commerce giant, Alibaba, could help small American businesses create 1 million new jobs. Now, though, Ma\u2019s Ant Financial offshoot has failed to secure approval for its $1.2 billion purchase of cash-transfer outfit MoneyGram International.   The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which vets foreign acquirers, still wouldn\u2019t approve the deal more than 11 months after Ant first bid, according to the companies, and they have scrapped it in favor of less concrete cooperation. News reports and remarks from U.S. lawmakers of both parties, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, have suggested increasing resistance to such transactions, including concern that data on U.S. customers of MoneyGram could fall into Chinese government hands \u2013 especially with Beijing a shareholder in Ant.  It wasn\u2019t exactly a totemic deal for Ant or for China, although its collapse and the $30 million break fee Ant is paying MoneyGram may dent Ma\u2019s ego. Still, it would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People\u2019s Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam\u2019s payments infrastructure.  For Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing\u2019s tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China\u2019s financial system. Rather than opening the door \u2013 arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done \u2013 CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it\u2019s a rebuke, it\u2019s one that\u2019s conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment.  Even MoneyGram could salvage something from the situation if Euronet Worldwide, whose bid for MoneyGram last year was eventually trumped by Ant\u2019s improved offer, is still interested.  Ma\u2019s disappointed ambition may just be collateral damage in the more combative approach Washington is taking to engagement with China, via CFIUS and other channels. That could conceivably help force the country\u2019s leaders to consider making life easier for foreign would-be acquirers. That seems a long shot, though. More likely it will endure simply as a symbol of Trump\u2019s America First posture. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The Razorbacks, playing their first game since entering the Top 25 for the first time in three years after upsetting then-No. 19 in overtime Tennessee on Saturday, fell to 11-3 overall, 1-1 in SEC action.  Daryl Macon led Arkansas with 24 points, Daniel Gafford scored 17, Jaylen Barford had 11 and Adrio Bailey 10.

Ray Spalding scored 10 points, and Ryan McMahon added another 10 off the bench for the Cardinals (11-3, 1-0).  Louisville has won its last 11 matchups against Pittsburgh \u2014 its second-longest current winning streak against an ACC opponent behind Virginia Tech at 12.  Freshman guard Parker Stewart led Pittsburgh (8-7, 0-2) with 12 points, while Marcus Carr added 11 and Shamiel Stevenson had 10.

Parker Stewart ended the drought with a 3-pointer with 6:52 left.  Louisville was dominant at both ends of the court and continued to pull away. Pittsburgh struggled to contain the Cardinals\u2019 quick transition.  A pair of 3-pointers by Snider increased Louisville\u2019s margin to 41-23 at the break. The Cardinals outscored the Panthers 24-10 in the paint and had nine points off nine turnovers.

A layup by Anas Mahmoud provided a 48-32 lead with 14:31 left in the game and Pittsburgh never threatened the rest of the way.

After giving up 15 goals over the three-game skid, Columbus (23-15-3) put together a dominant defensive performance against the Stars (22-16-3). Blue Jackets goalie Sergei Bobrovsky finished with 21 saves.  After neither team could capitalize on several scoring opportunities, Dallas\u2019 Devin Shore finally broke through 44 seconds into the third period off a nifty passing sequence. It was Shore\u2019s fifth goal of the season.  Bjorkstrand answered for Columbus with a pair of goals, one at 4:54 and the other at 6:12. Lukas Sedlak registered assists on both tallies. Bjorkstrand has eight goals on the season.  The Blue Jackets contained Dallas the rest of the way.  Dallas goaltender Ben Bishop made his ninth straight start and finished with 24 saves. He has allowed 10 goals and has two shutouts in his past six starts.  Dallas was coming off a dominant 6-0 victory over the San Jose Sharks on New Year\u2019s Eve. Forward Alexander Radulov sustained an upper-body injury in that game but managed to play 18:53 against Columbus.  The Blue Jackets had the better play in a scoreless opening period and outshot Dallas 8-7. However, Columbus could not take advantage of a penalty on Jamie Benn for hooking Sedlak with 3:56 remaining.  The Stars played better in the second period, but Bobrovsky came up with a couple of big saves on shots by Tyler Pitlick and Antoine Roussel. Neither defense would budge, and Bishop made a nice stop on a wrist shot by Seth Jones to keep the game scoreless heading into the final period.  The Blue Jackets play three of their next four games on the road, where they are 9-8-3 on the season. Columbus visits the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, the same night Dallas plays host to the New Jersey Devils.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Matt Cullen and Eric Staal each scored two goals, and Jared Spurgeon had three assists to lead the Minnesota Wild to a 5-1 victory over the Florida Panthers on Tuesday night at Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minn.  Devan Dubnyk 25 saves and Charlie Coyle also scored for Minnesota, which won for the third time in four games and snapped Florida\u2019s season-high, five-game winning streak.  James Reimer stopped 23 of 26 shots and backup Harri Sateri stopped 13 of 14 for Florida (17-17-5). The Panthers were outshot 41-26, including 32-11 in the first two periods.  Minnesota (21-16-3) took a 1-0 lead at 14:21 of the first period when Cullen knocked in a rebound of a Spurgeon slap shot from the left side of the net. Reimer, fighting around a screen by Wild forward Marcus Foligno, did the splits and barely got a skate on Spurgeon\u2019s shot, but the rebound went straight to Cullen, who quickly poked it into the net.  Cullen, who entered the contest with just two goals in 38 games, got his second goal of the night at 1:56 of the second period. He scored on a double redirect of a Gustav Olofsson shot from the blue line that was first deflected by Foligno in the slot. The puck fell toward Cullen, who redirected it again past Reimer from the right side of the net for his 699th career point.  Staal then made it 4-0 with a pair of goals in a 2:39 span late in the middle period. The first came on a rebound in front of the net of another Spurgeon slap shot against Sateri, who briefly replaced Reimer while the starter was looked at in the locker room, and the second off a nice pass from Tyler Ennis while cutting alone in front of the net.  Florida\u2019s Jonathan Huberdeau scored his 14th goal of the season and fifth in five games off a crossing pass from Vincent Trocheck early in the third period to spoil Dubnyk\u2019s chance at a fourth shutout this season.  Coyle concluded the scoring with his third goal of the season, into an empty net with 3:05 to go.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Florida (10-4, 2-0) found the shooting touch it has been lacking since the early part of this season. The Gators scored over 100 points in four of their first five games \u2014 all of which they won.  Florida has now won four straight games, including its first two in the SEC.  The Gators did not make a free throw in the contest \u2014 missing their only one, which came in the second half \u2014 but they did not need any since they shot 52 percent from the field (33-for-64) and 61 percent (17-for-28) on 3-pointers.  Koulechov, a graduate transfer from Rice, made 5 of 6 3-pointers and 7 of 13 shots overall. Stone hit 4 of 6 3-point shots and went 7-for-14 overall.  Chris Chiozza added 12 points and nine assists, and Jalen Hudson (11 points) also helped as the Florida offense proved too much, thanks to its accurate shooting touch.  Earlier this season, the Gators at one point were the top-ranked offensive team in the country before the shooting struggles started. The Gators were ranked as high as No. 5 in the nation before falling out of the Top 25 completely.  More performances like this could help Florida find its way back into the poll.  In Tuesday\u2019s game, Florida hit 56 percent from the field and 62 percent on 3-point shots in the first half, rolling to a 46-30 lead over Texas A&M (11-3, 0-2) at halftime.  The Gators started quickly and were on top 21-15 before one run helped them break things open in the first half. They scored 12 of the next 14 points for a 33-17 edge, thanks to five from Stone \u2014 including a 3-pointer.  Jay Jay Chandler led the Aggies with 17 points as they couldn\u2019t catch up after the fast Florida start.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Ovechkin\u2019s 26th goal of the season came unassisted 1:57 into overtime as the Metropolitan Division-leading Capitals snapped Carolina\u2019s six-game, home-ice winning streak.  Ovechkin tied the game at 4-4 with 7:15 to play in regulation.  Alex Chiasson, Devante Smith-Pelly and Dmitry Orlov also scored for the Capitals (25-13-3), who were playing in their only game of the week.  Washington, which has at least one point in 13 of its past 15 games, led 3-1 midway through the second period before the Hurricanes responded.  Carolina (18-13-8) lost its second game in a row following a season-high, four-game winning streak.  Victor Rask collected his second goal of the game at 11:15 of the middle period, and Elias Lindholm and Teuvo Teravainen scored in an 84-second span of the third period to lift the Hurricanes into a 4-3 lead.  The winning goal came on Washington\u2019s only shot on goal in the extra session.  Goaltender Braden Holtby made 34 saves for the Capitals.  Carolina goalie Cam Ward had his personal streak of victories in six straight decisions end. He stopped 21 shots.  Carolina\u2019s Sebastian Aho assisted on Teravainen\u2019s go-ahead goal, pushing his points streak to five games.  Rask\u2019s first goal came 5:21 into the game when he converted a Capitals turnover into an unassisted goal.  He pulled the Hurricanes within 3-2 with a power-play goal in the second period. That gave Rask 10 goals this season.  Carolina\u2019s Justin Williams had one assist in his first game of the season against his former team.  It was the first of three meetings between the teams in an 11-day stretch. The Hurricanes go on a four-game road swing before returning home for a game against the Capitals.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Andrei Vasilevskiy recorded his second consecutive shutout and NHL-leading sixth of the season to lead the Tampa Bay Lighting to a 2-0 road win over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday.  Vasilevskiy turned aside 29 shots to improve his season record to 26-5-1. Cedric Paquette scored his first goal of the season and Alex Killorn also tallied for the Lightning (29-8-2). Chris Kunitz, Mikhail Sergachev and Yanni Gourde recorded the assists.  Frederik Andersen stopped 34 shots for the Maple Leafs (23-16-2). Toronto has dropped its last three games.  The Lightning rolled through the month of December, winning 11 of 13 games. They began a five-game road trip on New Year\u2019s Eve by blanking Columbus, 5-0.  The Maple Leafs were beginning a six-game homestand after playing eight of their last nine on the road. They went 3-6 during that rugged stretch but still entered the New Year in second place in the Atlantic Division.  Tampa Bay outshot Toronto 12-10 in the first period but neither side could break though. Both teams had just one power play.  The Lightning\u2019s top-ranked power play came up empty twice in the second period but they broke through on even-strength situations to gain a 2-0 advantage.  Kunitz won a battle for the puck with Andersen behind the net and fed it to Paquette in front of the goal. Paquette\u2019s goal broke the scoreless deadlock 12 minutes into the second period.  Killorn notched his fifth goal of the season less than five minutes later off feeds from Sergachev and Gourde. The goal came after a replay review, where it was determined that Killorn\u2019s shot trickled just over the goal line off Andersen\u2019s left skate.  Vasilevskiy stopped 11 third-period shots to preserve the shutout. The Lightning have allowed just one goal in their last four victories, all with Vasilevskiy protecting the net.  The Lightning resume their road trip at Montreal on Thursday, while the Maple Leafs host San Jose the same evening.  \u2014Field Level Media"

With the offense running through him on virtually every possession, Happ piled up a season-high 28 points to lead Wisconsin to a 71-61 Big Ten victory over Indiana on Tuesday night at Kohl Center.  \u201cI think the biggest thing is that we stuck together and we know that we can get wins even though we\u2019re down on bodies,\u201d said Happ, who added nine rebounds, four assists, four steals and two blocks.  The Badgers (9-7, 2-1 Big Ten) won their fifth game in a row overall and their 16th consecutive against the Hoosiers (8-7, 1-2) on the Kohl Center floor.  Indiana, which was paced by redshirt senior walk-on Collin Hartman\u2019s career-high 18 points, hasn\u2019t won in Madison since 1998.  Freshman guard Brad Davison (14 points) and junior forward Khalil Iverson (10 points) also contributed double figures for Wisconsin.  Junior forward Juwan Morgan posted 17 points and four steals for Indiana, and senior guard Robert Johnson notched 14 points.  Badgers freshman center Nathan Reuvers earned his first start and buried a 3-pointer 1:32 into the game to give Wisconsin a 6-0 lead. Reuvers started for junior guard Brevin Pritzl (8.4 points per game), who missed a game for the first time this season due to a head injury, giving the Badgers three key perimeter players on the sideline.  Then something happened that ought to have helped the Badgers further: Indiana center De\u2019Ron Davis (10.1 ppg) picked up his second foul at the 17:33 mark and left for the rest of the half. Hartman, a redshirt senior walk-on averaging 5.3 points, jumped into the fray and went wild.  Hartman scored 13 points \u2014 drilling 3 of 5 3-point attempts along the way \u2014 to lift the Hoosiers to a 33-30 halftime lead. Essentially, he matched Happ hoop for hoop. The All-Big Ten center delivered 15 of Wisconsin\u2019s 30 points and 4 of its 9 rebounds before the break while putting Davis and Morgan on the bench for long stretches with two fouls apiece.  Indiana coach Archie Miller returned Davis to the floor to start the second half, but Morgan left with his third foul at the 17:00 mark to allow Hartman back into the fray. Hartman flushed a 3-pointer from the wing with 13:39 to play to give the Hoosiers a 45-44 lead and set his career high with 16 points.  However, that was when Wisconsin seized control. With the Badgers continuing to run their patient swing offense through Happ in the post, the wiry 6-foot-10 junior either scored or assisted on his side\u2019s next six baskets. Happ passed out of double teams to set up 3-pointers by Davison and redshirt freshman Aleem Ford, and then he capped the run with a jumper that gave Wisconsin a 62-51 lead with 4:34 to play.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Leonard, who missed the Dec. 28 matchup to manage his recovering quad injury, had 25 points on 8-of-20 shooting and grabbed eight rebounds in 30 minutes to pace San Antonio.  After scoring 25 points in the Spurs\u2019 119-107 victory in their previous meeting, LaMarcus Aldridge finished with 19 points and five boards while Manu Ginobili scored 12 points and Pau Gasol had 11 and eight rebounds.  San Antonio (26-12) bounced back from its 93-79 loss to a depleted Detroit team on the road Saturday to win for the seventh time in nine games.  Kristaps Porzingis was one of three Knicks with 13 points and also grabbed nine rebounds. Courtney Lee and Lance Thomas also scored 13, Enes Kanter had 12 and Jarrett Jack chipped in 12 for New York.  The Knicks (18-19) have lost five of their last six after Saturday\u2019s 105-103 victory against New Orleans.  Tim Hardaway Jr. missed his 16th straight game for New York due to a left leg stress injury.  Ron Baker sat for the Knicks after suffering an orbital fracture while trying to defend an Anthony Davis dunk Saturday. Baker, officially day-to-day, will be fitted for a mask and is likely to return Wednesday on the road against Washington.  The Spurs were playing their second straight game without Rudy Gay, who is sidelined with retrocalcaneal bursitis in his right heel.  The Spurs led just 52-49 at halftime behind a 15-point half for Leonard, but managed to outscore the Knicks 29-18 in the third.  Courtney Lee\u2019s 3-pointer with 6:18 remaining brought New York within 90-82. Willy Hernangomez made 1 of 2 free throws at the 5:42 mark to make it a 7-point game, but San Antonio scored 10 of the next 18 points to close out the win.

Meier\u2019s two goals 1:23 apart late in the second period and early in the third gave San Jose a three-goal lead.  The Sharks rebounded nicely from a 6-0 loss to the Dallas Stars on Sunday. San Jose now is 7-2-2 in its last 11 games.  San Jose goalie Aaron Dell finished with 30 saves while winning his sixth consecutive start.  Joe Thornton scored the other San Jose goal and Kevin Labanc added two assists.  Montreal\u2019s struggles continued as the Canadiens lost their fifth consecutive game in their first home contest since Dec. 14.  Thornton gave San Jose an early lead thanks to a fortunate bounce and some quick stickwork in the first period.  Teammate Justin Braun fired a shot that sailed wide and past Montreal goalie Carey Price. The puck then hit Thornton, standing to Price\u2019s left and just behind the goalie. The puck fell to the ice, and Thornton quickly shoved it into the net for a 1-0 lead with 7:03 remaining. Vlasic picked up the second assist.  Vlasic made it 2-0 with his second-period goal by finishing off a two-on-one with Mikkel Boedker.  Boedker raced up the right wing and fired a shot that Price stopped, but the puck slid to the left, and Vlasic put it away with 8:33 remaining in the period. Labanc earned the other assist.

          "title": "CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-U.S. blocks MoneyGram sale to China's Ant Financial",
          "body": "(Corrects the deal status of China Oceanwide Holdings in pars 10 and 11)  By Greg Roumeliotis  Jan 2 (Reuters) - A U.S. government panel rejected Ant Financial\u2019s acquisition of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc over national security concerns, the companies said on Tuesday, the most high-profile Chinese deal to be torpedoed under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.  The $1.2 billion deal\u2019s collapse represents a blow for Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Chinese internet conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, who owns Ant Financial together with Alibaba executives. He was looking to expand Ant Financial\u2019s footprint amid fierce domestic competition from Chinese rival Tencent Holdings Ltd\u2019s WeChat payment platform.  Ma, a Chinese citizen who appears frequently with leaders from the highest echelons of the Communist Party, had promised Trump in a meeting a year ago that he would create 1 million U.S. jobs.  MoneyGram shares were down 8.5 percent at $12.06 in after-market trading.  The companies decided to terminate their deal after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) rejected their proposals to mitigate concerns over the safety of data that can be used to identify U.S. citizens, according to sources familiar with the confidential discussions.  \u201cDespite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger,\u201d MoneyGram Chief Executive Alex Holmes said in a statement.  A standard CFIUS review lasts up to 75 days, and the companies had gone through the process three times in order to address concerns. Additional security measures and protocols that the companies suggested failed to reassure CFIUS, the sources said.  The U.S. Treasury said it is prohibited by statute from disclosing information filed with CFIUS and declined to comment on the MoneyGram deal.  The U.S. government has toughened its stance on the sale of companies to Chinese entities, at a time when Trump is trying to put pressure on China to help tackle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues.  The MoneyGram deal is the latest in a string of Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies that have failed to clear CFIUS. They include China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC\u2019s $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor Corp and Chinese buyout firm Orient Hontai Capital\u2019s $1.4 billion acquisition of U.S. mobile marketing firm AppLovin.  In November, China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd and Genworth Financial Inc extended a deadline to April 1 for the Chinese group\u2019s planned $2.7 billion takeover of the U.S. life insurer.  The MoneyGram\u2019s deal demise is also the latest example of how CFIUS\u2019 focus on cyber security and the integrity of personal data is prompting it to block deals in sectors not traditionally associated with national security, such as financial services.  Other U.S. financial services deals by Chinese firms are waiting for approval from CFIUS, including HNA Group Co\u2019s acquisition of hedge fund-of-funds firm SkyBridge Capital LLC from Anthony Scaramucci, the Trump administration\u2019s former communications director.  SkyBridge and HNA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Dallas-based MoneyGram has approximately 350,000 remittance locations in more than 200 countries. Ant Financial was looking to take over MoneyGram not so much for its U.S. presence but to expand in growing markets outside of China.  Ant Financial and MoneyGram said they will now explore and develop initiatives to work together in remittance and digital payments in China, India, the Philippines and other Asian markets, as well as in the United States. This cooperation will take the form of commercial agreements, one of the sources said.  Any arrangements reached by Ant Financial and MoneyGram that do not involve a transaction would not be subject to review by CFIUS.  Some U.S. lawmakers, including Republican Senators Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran, had written to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who also serves as chairman of CFIUS, to express concern that Ant Financial\u2019s acquisition of MoneyGram could pose national security threats, arguing that the information of U.S. citizens, including military personnel, could be compromised.  Ant Financial had argued that MoneyGram\u2019s data infrastructure would remain in the United States, with personal information encrypted or held in secure facilities on U.S. soil. It had also pointed to existing U.S. regulations that call for such protections.  CFIUS had approved a previous deal by Ant Financial, its acquisition in 2016 of Kansas City-based EyeVerify, which designs a mobile eye verification technology.  \u201cWhat is more likely to happen at this point is that MoneyGram will sell to another company, and one company that has shown interest in the past is Euronet,\u201d said Gil Luria, an equity analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.  Ant Financial clinched an $18 per share all-cash deal to acquire MoneyGram in April, seeing off competition from U.S.-based Euronet Worldwide Inc, which had made an unsolicited offer for MoneyGram and openly lobbied U.S lawmakers, saying Ant\u2019s proposal created a national security risk.  \u201cEuronet continues to believe there is compelling commercial logic to a combination between Euronet and MoneyGram. However, significant developments have been disclosed by MoneyGram since Euronet\u2019s offer, and Euronet has not conducted any evaluation of the business in that time. While we continue to view a transaction with MoneyGram as logical, there is no guarantee any offer will be made or any transaction will ultimately occur,\u201d Euronet said in a statement.  Ant Financial said it paid MoneyGram a $30 million termination fee for the deal\u2019s collapse.

          "body": "The Pittsburgh Penguins exploded for four goals in the second period to defeat the Philadelphia Flyers, 5-1, Tuesday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Phil Kessel, Ryan Reaves, Conor Sheary, Tom Kuhnhackl and Jamie Oleksiak each scored and the Penguins improved to 20-18-3 with a pair of victories over the Flyers this season. Riley Sheahan and Evgeni Malkin each added a pair of assists for Pittsburgh.  The two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Penguins had dropped seven of their last 10 games, including a 4-1 loss at Detroit on New Year\u2019s Eve.  Jordan Weal scored for the Flyers, who opened their four-game homestand in shaky fashion.  Philadelphia goaltender Brian Elliott started his 14th consecutive game and struggled mightily in the second period. The Flyers fell to 16-15-8 and couldn\u2019t maintain the momentum gained from a 5-3 win Friday at Tampa Bay.  Elliott was pulled for the final 20 minutes and replaced by Michal Neuvirth.  In a wild second period, the teams combined for four goals in a short span of 2:14 with the Penguins scoring three times and the Flyers once.  Kessel scored his 17th of the season on the power play with 10:25 remaining. It was the fifth straight game that the Flyers had allowed the first goal.  Just 54 seconds later, Weal responded with his fourth goal after redirecting Radko Gudas\u2019 shot in front.  Reaves was an unlikely candidate to put the Penguins ahead 2-1 but that\u2019s exactly what happened with his first goal in 38 games with 8:51 left. Forty seconds after Reaves\u2019 goal, Sheary got loose on a breakaway and gave Pittsburgh a 3-1 advantage following his 11th goal of the season.  Kuhnhackl, a fourth-line right winger, extended the lead to three goals at 4-1 with 6:34 remaining.  The four Pittsburgh goals came on only eight shots and when the buzzer sounded, boos were clearly heard from the Flyers fans.  Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry stopped 16 of 17 shots before leaving with an apparent injury. Jarry was replaced by Matt Murray late in the second.  Oleksiak scored the Penguins\u2019 fifth goal with 5:56 left.  The four-goal advantage was more than enough and the Penguins moved to 11-0-0 this season when leading after two periods.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The United States accused Pakistan on Tuesday of playing a \u201cdouble game\u201d on fighting terrorism and warned Islamabad it would have to do more if it wanted to maintain U.S. aid.  \u201cThey can do more to stop terrorism and we want them to do that,\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.  The White House said it would likely announce actions to pressure Pakistan within days, shortly after U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said at the United Nations that Washington would withhold $255 million in assistance to Pakistan.  \u201cThere are clear reasons for this. Pakistan has played a double game for years,\u201d Haley told reporters. \u201cThey work with us at times, and they also harbor the terrorists that attack our troops in Afghanistan.  \u201cThat game is not acceptable to this administration. We expect far more cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.\u201d  The comments followed an angry tweet from President Donald Trump on Monday that the United States had been rewarded with \u201cnothing but lies and deceit\u201d for \u201cfoolishly\u201d giving Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid in the past 15 years.  \u201cThey give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!\u201d he tweeted.  Pakistan civilian and military chiefs on Tuesday rejected   \u201cincomprehensible\u201d U.S. comments and summoned American Ambassador David Hale to explain Trump\u2019s tweet.   Pakistani U.N. Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi said in a statement that her country\u2019s fight against terrorism was not based on any consideration of aid but on national interests and principles.  \u201cWe have contributed and sacrificed the most in fighting international terrorism and carried out the largest counter terrorism operation anywhere in the world,\u201d Lodhi said. \u201cWe can review our cooperation if it is not appreciated.\u201d  Relations with Washington have been strained for years over Islamabad\u2019s alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban.  The United States also alleges that senior Afghan Taliban commanders live on Pakistani soil, and has signaled it will cut aid and take other steps if Islamabad does not stop helping or turning a blind eye to Haqqani militants crossing the border to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.  In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Mansour was killed by a U.S. drone strike inside Pakistan and in 2011, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. troops in the garrison town of Abbottabad.  At the State Department on Tuesday, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Pakistan knew what it needed to do, including taking action against the Haqqani network and other militants.  Pakistan needs to \u201cearn, essentially, the money that we have provided in the past in foreign military assistance,\u201d she said.   Islamabad bristles at the suggestion it is not doing enough to fight militants, noting that its casualties at the hands of Islamists since 2001 number in the tens of thousands.  Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday chaired a National Security Committee meeting of civilian and military chiefs, focusing on Trump\u2019s tweet. The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, was brought forward by a day and followed an earlier meeting of army generals.  The committee, in a statement issued by the prime minister\u2019s office, did not name Trump but spoke of \u201cdeep disappointment\u201d at a slew of critical comments from U.S. officials over the past few months.  \u201cRecent statements and articulation by the American leadership were completely incomprehensible as they contradicted facts manifestly, struck with great insensitivity at the trust between two nations built over generations, and negated the decades of sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation,\u201d it said.

The defeat spoiled a terrific effort from Alabama freshman Collin Sexton, who had a game-high 24 points. Center Donta Hall scored 14 and hit all six of his field goal attempts.  Vanderbilt (6-8) also got double-figures from forward Jeff Roberson (17) and guards Matthew Fisher-Davis (11) and Riley LaChance (10).  Lee had 16 in the first half, then put the Commodores up 74-65, weaving his way for a nifty layup through traffic with 1:41 left.  But the Crimson Tide cranked up the pressure and got three steals leading to six points from there.  Alabama nearly got a fourth, but a pass from LaChance somehow rolled its way to center Djery Baptiste on the left block. The sophomore laid it in with 18 seconds left, putting Vandy up by three.  Leading by 10 at the half, Vanderbilt quickly extended its advantage to 15 on LaChance\u2019s step-back 3 and Roberson\u2019s layup off a fast break.  But Alabama roared back when forward Braxton Key, playing in his home city, drove the right side for a layup that cut the lead to 63-59 with 8:43 left.  Vanderbilt never trailed in the second half, but never got the lead in double figures from there.  Vanderbilt took its first lead of the first half when Fisher-Davis hit back-to-back 3s to put the Commodores up 18-13.  Alabama trailed by eight, then Sexton drove through traffic and hit a layup with 4:39 left to tie it at 31 at the end of a Tide run.  That\u2019s when Lee took over the remainder of the half, scoring the game\u2019s next 12 points off a pair of layups, two 3-pointers and two foul shots.  Fisher-Davis, who has started eight games and ranks third on the team in minutes, suffered from the flu and missed shootaround.  This was just the second true road game of the season for Alabama.

Xavier (15-1, 3-0 Big East) has won 10 straight games since losing to fourth-ranked Arizona State on November 24.  It\u2019s the Musketeers\u2019 best start since the 2015 team won 16 games before its second loss.  Kamar Baldwin scored 28 points and Kelan Martin added 25 for Butler (12-4, 2-1 Big East) which was coming off an emotional 101-93 win over then top-ranked Villanova at Hinkle Fieldhouse on Saturday.  The Bulldogs who hit 15 3-pointers including a school-record 10 straight in the win over \u2018Nova, were 7 of 27 from long range Tuesday night.  Xavier led by as many as nine points in the first half and closed with a 7-0 run to take a 44-36 lead at halftime.  Macura starred for the Musketeers in the half, scoring 15 points and going 3 of 7 from 3-point range. Bluiett had 10 including two 3s.  Martin who had 15 points in the first half to lead Butler went scoreless for around 13 minutes.  Xavier stayed hot from the perimeter in the second half.  Gates\u2019 first 3-pointer of the night increased Xavier\u2019s lead to 51-41 early in the second half.  Macura hit a 3-pointer on a kick-out from O\u2019Mara and Gates connected again from distance to put the Musketeers ahead by 14 with nine minutes remaining.  Gates picked up his fourth foul with 8:38 left and Butler was hanging around.  The Bulldogs reduced a 14-point deficit to single digits on Henry Baddley\u2019s jumper with five minutes left.

But, Bluiett and Macura, the nation\u2019s top scoring duo proved too much.  Xavier leads the all-time series 39-20 including wins in 11 of the past 15 meetings. The Musketeers\u2019 win over Butler in last year\u2019s Big East Tournament rescued XU\u2019s NCAA Tournament chances and sparked a run to the Elite Eight."

          "title": "Column: Hedge funds gamble OPEC will tighten oil market too much - Kemp",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds are the most bullish about oil prices in years, expecting further gains even as prices touch multi-year highs and ignoring the risk linked to such a large concentration of positions.  A record net long position has been accumulated by hedge funds and other money managers, amounting to 1,183 million barrels in the five biggest futures and options contracts covering crude, gasoline and heating oil.  Portfolio managers held a record 1,328 million barrels of long positions in Brent, WTI, U.S. gasoline and U.S. heating oil on Dec. 26, according to data published by regulators and exchanges.  By contrast, hedge funds held only 145 million barrels of short positions, the lowest level for 10 months and among the lowest at any point since the start of 2013.  Fund managers now hold more than nine long positions for every short position, the most bullish picture for at least five years (tmsnrt.rs/2CduGpC).  There are record net long positions in Brent crude (561 million barrels), WTI (461 million barrels) and U.S. heating oil (82 million barrels).  There are also large, if not quite record, net long positions in U.S. gasoline (79 million barrels) and European gasoil (131 million barrels).  In many of these contracts hedge fund positioning appears extremely stretched, with the ratio of long to short positions at multi-year highs.  The concentration of so many bullish positions poses a significant downside risk to prices if and when portfolio managers decide to close them out and realize some of their paper profits.  For the time being, however, most fund managers are ignoring the liquidation risk and focusing on the prospect of further price increases first.  There are plenty of reasons to be bullish about the outlook in 2018. The global economy is in a synchronized upswing and world trade is growing at the fastest rate since the start of the decade.  Stocks of crude and products have fallen significantly since the middle of 2017. Oil demand is growing rapidly while OPEC and its allies have extended their production pact until at least the middle of the year.  History suggests OPEC is more likely to tighten the oil market too much and allow prices to overshoot on the upside than rather than relax production cuts too early and risk prices falling back.  Such was the case after both the previous oil market slumps in 1997/98 and 2008/09, with prices overshooting the producer group\u2019s initial targets.  OPEC\u2019s tightening bias probably explains why many hedge funds remain bullish despite benchmark Brent prices moving towards $70 a barrel.  The main downside risk comes from a resurgence of U.S. shale oil production, with WTI prices now above $60 a barrel.  If shale output starts to climb faster than expected OPEC could be forced to halt production cuts earlier than currently envisaged.  The existence of so many hedge fund long positions could eventually magnify the downside risk posed by U.S. shale.  However, most hedge fund managers seem to have concluded that the risk is some way off and prices have more scope to climb before the inevitable correction.   Editing by David Goodman"

Thomas scored 17 points off the bench in his season and Cavaliers debut to help host Cleveland top the Portland Trail Blazers 127-110 despite Lillard\u2019s 25-point night.  Thomas, who before the game said he was excited to show fans what they wanted to see after he missed the first 36 games of the season recovering from a hip injury, did not disappoint.  The 5-foot-9 guard made 6 of 12 shots in 18 minutes, missing his first attempt \u2014 a 3-point try with 3:36 remaining in the first quarter \u2014 before making back-to-back buckets to close out the opening period.  \u201cIt was great,\u201d James said of Thomas\u2019 return. \u201cJust to see him, his first basket, he had his pull-up shot going a little bit. It\u2019s a spark and jolt we need on our team right now.\u201d  Lillard was returning from a five-game absence caused by a right hamstring strain, but he had little trouble duplicating his past scoring dominance. He also had six assists but committed seven turnovers in 32 minutes.  LeBron James totaled 24 points, eight assists and six rebounds, Kevin Love added 19 points and seven boards, Jae Crowder scored 17 and Dwyane Wade had 15 and eight rebounds to help the Cavaliers (25-12) snap a three-game losing streak.  The Cavaliers earned their 13th consecutive home win.  Jusuf Nurkic and CJ McCollum aided Lillard\u2019s efforts with 23 and 19 points respectively, while former Ohio State star Evan Turner scored 15 for the Trail Blazers.  Portland (19-18) had won three of four coming in.  Thomas, acquired from Boston in the offseason blockbuster that sent James\u2019 longtime running mate Kyrie Irving to the Celtics, will not play against his former team on the road in a back-to-back Wednesday night.  He got standing ovation when he checked out of game with 8:10 left in fourth quarter with the Cavaliers leading 102-91.  Portland led 56-53 at halftime and was within 91-87 entering the fourth.  Maurice Harkless\u2019 trey with 11:22 remaining tied the game at 91, but Cleveland went on a 12-0 run capped by a pair of Wade free throws with 8:10 left to create the key separation. The Cavaliers outscored the Trail Blazers 36-23 in the closing 12 minutes.  Portland is back home for two games starting Friday against Atlanta.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Danton Heinen scored in the first, Patrice Bergeron scored the go-ahead goal in the second and Brad Marchand and Tim Schaller provided insurance goals in the third for the Bruins (22-10-6), who capped the scoring with an empty-netter by Noel Acciari with 2:13 left. Boston has won seven of its last 10 (7-1-2).  Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask, who was named the NHL\u2019s first star of the month for December earlier Tuesday, recorded 25 saves in winning his sixth straight start. Rask went 9-0-1 last month.  Jordan Eberle scored for the Islanders (20-16-4), who have lost three straight (0-3-0) and seven of 10 (3-6-1). Goalie Jaroslav Halak made 33 saves.  Both teams scored goals immediately off faceoffs within a 73-second span shortly before the midway point of the first.  After the Bruins\u2019 Riley Nash won a faceoff deep in the New York zone with John Tavares, the puck bounced to Heinen, whose shot from the circle sailed past Halak 8:17 into the period.  Bergeron won his faceoff against the Islanders\u2019 Mathew Barzal in the Boston zone, after which the puck skittered towards the net as Eberle and Bruins defenseman Brandon Carlo chased after it. But Carlo fell, which left Eberle all alone in front of Rask. Eberle maneuvered the puck to the left of the net and, with Rask falling to the right, tucked a shot into the corner.  Bergeron put the Bruins ahead with an unusual goal 8:28 into the second. Brad Marchand\u2019s shot from point-blank range skipped over the head of Halak and behind the net, where Bergeron caught it, dropped it and wrapped a shot off the back of Halak\u2019s skate and into the back of the net.  Marchand and Schaller scored a little less than six minutes apart in the third to put the game away for the Bruins.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Mustapha Heron finished with 16 points, and Chuma Okeke added 11, including three 3-pointers in the second half, for the Tigers (13-1, 1-0 SEC). Horace Spencer contributed 10 points and nine rebounds for Auburn, which won its 11th consecutive game.  Lamonte Turner led the Volunteers (9-4, 0-2 SEC) with 25 points. He shot 13-for-13 from the foul line.  Grant Williams added 22 points and eight rebounds for the Vols, who have lost their first two SEC games. Jordan Bone scored 18 points, and Admiral Schofield had 13 points.  Tennessee, coming off an overtime loss at Arkansas, started hot against Auburn. The Vols opened the game with a 23-9 run, capped by a three-point play by Schofield.  Auburn stormed back with a 21-7 run, tying the score 30-30 on a layup from Okeke with five minutes to go in the first half. Spencer had a layup and finished an alley-oop dunk off a Brown assist, sending the Tigers into the locker room with a 42-36 lead.  Tennessee surged in front in the second half. Turner scored off of an offensive rebound to give the Vols a 61-56 lead with less than nine minutes to play, but Auburn wouldn\u2019t go away.  Brown knocked down his fourth 3-pointer from the top of the key, giving Auburn a 69-65 lead with six minutes left. Brown hit another 3-pointer three minutes later as the Tigers\u2019 lead ballooned to 12.  Auburn closed it out at the foul line and picked up its first win in Knoxville since Jan. 7, 1998, ending a 10-game skid on the road against Tennessee. The win was also Auburn coach Bruce Pearl\u2019s first road triumph over Tennessee, where he spent seven seasons coaching the Vols.  Auburn returns home to take on No. 22 Arkansas on Saturday.  Tennessee will look to bounce back when it hosts No. 17 Kentucky on Saturday.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "title": "Oil prices close to mid-2015 highs, but doubts over further rises loom",
          "body": "SINGAPORE, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Wednesday, not far off mid-2015 highs reached the previous session, as strong demand and ongoing efforts led by OPEC and Russia to curb production tightened the market.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $60.40 a barrel at 0141 GMT, up 3 cents from their last close, and not far off the $60.74 June 2015 high reached the previous day.  Brent crude futures - the international benchmark for oil prices - were at $66.55 a barrel, down 2 cents but still not far off the $67.29 May 2015 high from the previous day.  Despite this, there were indicators that markets had overshot in the last days of 2017 and trading this year, as U.S. production is set to rise further and doubts are emerging about whether demand growth can continue at current levels.  Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark\u2019s Saxo Bank warned that \u201cmultiple but temporary supply disruptions\u201d like the North Sea Forties and Libyan pipeline outages (and) protests across Iran ... helped create a record speculative long bet.\u201d  With the pipeline outages resolved and the protests in Iran showing no signs of impacting its oil production, Hansen said there was potential for a price downturn in early 2018, especially due to rising U.S. output.  \u201cIt is only a matter of time before the 10 million barrel per day (bpd) production target will be reached,\u201d Hansen said.  U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has risen by almost 16 percent since mid-2016, hitting 9.75 million bpd at the end of last year.  There was also some concern that output by Russia, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer and one of the key drivers together with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in cutting supplies, was in fact not falling.  As part of the supply cut deal, Russia pledged to reduce its output by 300,000 bpd from the 30-year monthly high of 11.247 million bpd hit in October 2016, which it achieved by the second quarter of 2017, according to Russian energy ministry data.  For the whole of 2017, however, Russian output rose to an average output of 10.98 million bpd, compared with 10.96 million bpd in 2016 and 10.72 million bpd in 2015.  \u201cWe also have some concerns about the Chinese economy in 2018 that ultimately could lead to lower than expected demand growth,\u201d Hansen said.  \u201cBy year-end we see Brent crude at $60 per barrel with WTI three dollars lower at $57 per barrel.\u201d  Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin"

          "title": "Syrian army preparing assault to end rebel siege of base east of capital",
          "body": "AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army backed by Russian jets escalated bombing of the last rebel bastion on the eastern outskirts of Damascus as they prepared to break a siege of an army base encircled by opposition forces, residents and witnesses said on Wednesday.  They said the army was amassing elite forces to prepare for a major assault on the Military Vehicles Administration, which is besieged by rebels. At least 200 troops were believed to be trapped within its sprawling, heavily defended grounds.   Since Sunday, rebels mainly belonging to the Islamist Ahrar al Sham faction widened their control of parts of the army base in Harasta that penetrates the Eastern Ghouta, the last rebel bastion around the capital.  They stormed the base last November in a drive to relieve pressure on Eastern Ghouta\u2019s towns and villages, which have seen escalating aerial attacks in the last week.  State media did not report the assault but said \u201cterrorists\u201d had fired mortars on residential areas in Harasta and the army responded by strikes in Eastern Ghouta that led to losses in the ranks of the insurgents. No further details were given.  Civil defense sources said that in four days of heavy aerial strikes since Friday 38 civilians have been killed and at least 147 people have been injured. Five civilians were killed on Tuesday.   The base has long been used to strike at the densely populated Eastern Ghouta in an attempt to force the rebel enclave to submission. More than 300,000 people there have lived under siege by army troops since 2013.   The advances bring rebels closer to the heart of the capital once again, after they were pushed out of their remaining pockets last year by months of siege and bombardment.  The army setback comes against a backdrop of successive battlefield victories that allowed the Syrian army with heavy reliance on Russia and Iran to regain in the last year large tracts of territory from insurgents.  Residents said at least 30 aerial strikes hit residential areas of Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday. Shelling of a market in the city of Douma, the main urban center in the Ghouta, left one dead and scores injured.   \u201cThe frontlines of Ghouta are witnessing battles and clashes and big losses inflicted on (Syrian President) Assad\u2019s forces and his militias,\u201d said Hamza Biriqdar, the spokesman for Jaish al Islam, a main rebel faction.  Further northwest, rebels ranging from jihadists to mainstream Free Syrian Army (FSA) were retreating from more villages seized by the army in southern Idlib province and the adjoining eastern Hama countryside.  The strikes have escalated in the last week on this major front with at least 50 villages retaken by the Syrian army and its allies in their push into the last major province in rebel hands that borders Turkey.   The intensity of strikes by Russia and the Syrian Air Force has driven tens of thousands of villagers in these areas to flee  to the relative safety of the northern part of Idlib province near of the Turkish border, where many families have spread makeshift tents on main roads and agricultural land.

In a game that featured nine lead changes and six ties, the Terrapins (13-3, 2-1) won a pivotal game - their seventh in a row \u2014 thanks to 18 points from Anthony Cowan and 17 and a career high 11 rebounds from freshman Bruno Fernando. Penn State (11-5, 1-2) got 17 points and career high 17 rebounds from Mike Watkins, but squandered a five-point lead in the second half.  The Terrapins trailed much of that second half and had been down five before a rally in the final six minutes. Freshman Darryl Morsell tied the game with a 3-pointer at 4:44, and then Michal Cekovsky, who had 10 points, got a stickback dunk to put Maryland ahead for the first time since late in the first half.  Lamar Stevens, who finished with 15 points, hit a 3-pointer to pull Penn State back within 65-64 at 2:28, but Kevin Huerter got a three-point play at the other end to make it 68-64 with just 1:58 remaining. Huerter, who was in foul trouble early, had 13 points and hit nine of nine free throws, all in the second half.  Penn State led 34-30 at halftime after trailing much of the first 20 minutes. Stevens hit a jumper at 1:39 to put the Nittany Lions up 28-27, their first lead since before the 10-minute mark. Maryland had enjoyed a 9-0 run to open a 19-13 advantage at 8:22 when Fernando scored on a stickback.  Penn State closed the half with a 9-3 spree, including Josh Reaves\u2019 3-pointer at the horn. Tony Carr had 16 points and eight assists for the Lions.  Maryland is playing the rest of the season without sophomore forward Justin Jackson (shoulder) and junior forward Ivan Bender, who went down with a torn meniscus in last Friday\u2019s win over UMBC.

          "body": "* Euro trades within sight of its Sept high of $1.2092  * Dollar index languishes near 3-1/2 month lows  * Near-term focus on coming Fed minutes and U.S. data  By Masayuki Kitano  SINGAPORE, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The euro traded within sight of its highest level in three years on Wednesday, underpinned by optimism about the euro zone\u2019s economic outlook.  The euro held steady at $1.2055, after rising as high as $1.2081 on Tuesday. That brought it close to the $1.2092 peak set in September, the euro\u2019s highest level since early 2015.  After 2017 proved the euro\u2019s best against the dollar in 14 years, the single currency started 2018 on a strong note, as European economies strengthened and expectations grew that the European Central Bank will wind down its monetary stimulus.  Euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high.  Also supporting the euro was a comment from an ECB official over the weekend. Benoit Coeure said he saw a \u201creasonable chance\u201d the bank\u2019s bond purchases would not be extended beyond September.  A more synchronised global recovery, with economic growth picking up outside the United States, has prompted other countries\u2019 central banks to start moving towards tighter monetary policy in recent months, helping bolster their currencies against the dollar.  Against that backdrop, the dollar has retreated broadly at the start of 2018.  The market\u2019s focus is on the global trend towards a more synchronised normalisation of monetary policies, said Heng Koon How, head of market strategy for United Overseas Bank in Singapore.  \u201cIt\u2019s this monetary policy normalisation everywhere that\u2019s playing catch-up to the Fed, and that\u2019s why the dollar is weak,\u201d Heng said.  Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar stood at 91.894, having touched a 3-1/2 month low of 91.751 on Tuesday.  The dollar held steady at 112.34 yen.  Later on Wednesday, investors will turn their attention to the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy meeting, at which the U.S. central bank raised interest rates for the third time in 2017.  The dollar could also take its cues from U.S. economic data in the next few days, including jobs data on Friday.  Currencies of commodity exporters stood tall after oil prices touched their highest levels since mid-2015 on Tuesday.  The Canadian dollar last stood at C$1.2515 per U.S. dollar. It briefly rose to C$1.2500 early on Wednesday, matching Tuesday\u2019s peak, which was the loonie\u2019s highest level since Oct. 20. (Reporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Richard Borsuk)"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said on Tuesday that churches may apply for aid relating to disasters declared after Aug. 23, 2017, following pressure from President Donald Trump and a lawsuit by Texas churches.  The federal disaster relief agency was sued in September by three Texas churches severely damaged in Hurricane Harvey, over what they called its policy of refusing to provide disaster relief to houses of worship because of their religious status.  Trump had said in a tweet that Texas churches should be able to receive money from FEMA for helping victims of Hurricane Harvey. It was not clear whether the three churches provided aid to victims.   The churches that sued are the Rockport First Assembly of God in Rockport, which lost its roof and steeple and suffered other structural damage, and the Harvest Family Church in Cypress and Hi-Way Tabernacle in Cleveland, which were both flooded.  In a complaint filed in federal court in Houston, the churches said they would like to apply for aid but it would be \u201cfutile\u201d because FEMA\u2019s public assistance program \u201ccategorically\u201d excluded their claims, violating their constitutional right to freely exercise their religion.  They said FEMA\u2019s ban on providing relief where at least half a building\u2019s space is used for religious purposes, a policy also enforced after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, contradicted a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision making it easier for religious groups to get public aid.

U.S. President Donald Trump responded to Kim in a Twitter post on Tuesday: \u201cWill someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d  Haley said the United States would not take talks seriously if they did not take steps toward banning North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons.  \u201cNorth Korea can talk to anyone they want, but the U.S. is not going to recognize it or acknowledge it until they agree to ban the nuclear weapons that they have,\u201d she said.  Haley gave no details of the missile test preparations.  Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were indications that could point toward a potential missile launch \u201csooner rather than later,\u201d but cautioned that such signs had been seen in the past and no test had resulted.  U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said North Korea might be \u201ctrying to drive a wedge of some sort\u201d between the United States and South Korea and added that while it was up to Seoul to decide who it talked to: \u201cWe are very skeptical of Kim Jong Un\u2019s sincerity in sitting down and having talks.\u201d  Trump, who has led a global drive to pressure North Korea through sanctions to give up development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States, earlier held back judgment on Pyongyang\u2019s offer to talk, saying on Twitter:  \u201cRocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. \u201cPerhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!\u201d  Trump has frequently derided Kim as \u201crocket man.\u201d The U.S. president said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea.   Kim and Trump have exchanged fiery barbs in the last year and the U.S. president has warned that the United States would have no choice but to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies.  North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan and tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead anywhere in the United States.  South Korea\u2019s Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon said the offer for high-level talks next Tuesday had been discussed with the United States. Nauert said she was not aware if the matter had been discussed in advance of the South Korean response.   Cho suggested the talks be held at the border village of Panmunjom and said they should be focused on North Korea\u2019s participation at the Olympics, but other issues would likely arise, including the denuclearisation of North Korea.  \u201cI repeat: The government is open to talking with North Korea, regardless of time, location and form,\u201d Cho said.  Should the talks be held, it would be the first such dialogue since a vice-ministerial meeting in December 2015.       South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed Kim\u2019s New Year address and asked his government to move as quickly as possible to bring North Korea to the Olympics, but he stressed that an improvement in inter-Korean relations \u201ccannot go separately with resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear program\u201d.  China, which has persistently urged a return to talks to ease tensions, said recent positive comments from North and South Korea were a good thing.  \u201cChina welcomes and supports North Korea and South Korea taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearisation on the peninsula,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.

          "body": "MANILA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The Philippines has suspended operations of a shopping mall and a call centre run by a U.S. firm where a fire killed 38 people, citing failure to fully comply with fire safety requirements for five successive years.  Investigators looking into the Dec. 23 blaze in Davao City, which broke out at a furniture and fabric store on a lower floor before engulfing the call centre\u2019s offices, said there were indications of fire safety lapses that may have contributed to the tragedy.  Charito Plaza, director-general of the government\u2019s Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), said the agency has suspended the registration of the New City Commercial Center (NCCC) and American firm Research Now SSI in Davao for failing to meet certain safety requirements since 2013.  \u201cViolations were more of the non-compliance of annual emergency drills to test the fire safety equipment, response and rescue capability, sprinklers and emergency exits,\u201d Plaza told Reuters in a text message.  The suspension took effect on Dec. 29, which meant NCC and SSI, will be barred from any further expansion in the Philippines.  NCCC could not immediately be reached for comment. An SSI official declined to comment and referred Reuters to its legal representative.  SSI employed 500 people at the Davao call centre and since the fire said it would not comment until after investigations were concluded. NCCC has insisted it had met safety requirements.  Four fire officials being questioned over the blaze have been relieved of their duties after initial findings from a probe showed they have \u201csome liabilities\u201d a government investigator said on Monday.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled support for anti-government protests in Iran, but in two weeks he faces a decision on U.S. policy toward the Islamic Republic that suddenly seems riskier than it did a week ago.  The six days of demonstrations in several Iranian cities began over economic conditions, and Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports under the terms of an international nuclear deal.  If he reimposes sanctions on oil, it could increase the economic pain for Iran\u2019s leaders. But analysts said it could also send the wrong message about U.S. support for Iran\u2019s people in the middle of the boldest challenge to the leadership in a decade.  The sanctions waivers were included in the 2015 nuclear pact with Iran that eased economic pressure on Tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.  Trump has repeatedly criticized the deal and promised to negotiate a better one. Reimposing oil sanctions would essentially kill the agreement.  Reviving sanctions on Iran\u2019s main export would allow Tehran to argue that the United States is ultimately the cause of Iran\u2019s economic problems, said Richard Nephew, who worked on sanctions policy at the White House under President Barack Obama.  \u201cLet\u2019s say Trump was inclined not to renew the waivers. I think that (the protests) make it very hard for him to do that now because now that plays into the regime\u2019s hands in a way that I don\u2019t frankly think the administration is going to want to do,\u201d said Nephew, now at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday that Trump has not made a final decision on whether to waive sanctions. Asked whether the protests had changed Trump\u2019s calculation, she replied: \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d  Ray Takeyh, an Iran expert and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Iran\u2019s leaders will blame internal troubles on the United States and other outside powers, no matter what Washington does.  \u201cThe regime\u2019s argument that the world is against us is a constant for 38 years,\u201d Takeyh said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe optics of waiving sanctions in the midst of all this - it just doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d  Takeyh and three U.S. officials who follow Iran said the protests undercut Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who took office in 2013 pledging to improve Iran\u2019s economy, more than they threaten the country\u2019s clerical rulers.  Former CIA Director John Brennan, in a Twitter post, said the Trump administration with its condemnation of Iran and the nuclear deal over the last year has squandered an opportunity to bolster reformists in Iran and promote peaceful political  change.  \u201cBluster is neither a strategy nor a mechanism for exercise of U.S. power and influence,\u201d Brennan wrote.  Yet in recent days, Trump and his top aides have charted a more careful course in reacting to the demonstrations, which have led to at least 21 deaths and hundreds of arrests.  Trump in a Tweet on Tuesday called the Tehran government a \u201cbrutal and corrupt regime.\u201d But he and other U.S. officials have shied away from suggesting Washington seeks the overthrow of Iran\u2019s Islamic theocracy, calling instead for Iranian authorities to respect protesters\u2019 rights.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert on Tuesday urged Iranian security forces to exercise restraint in dealing with protests and called on Tehran to restore access to social media sites that have been restricted.  Nauert suggested the U.S. government could impose sanctions against Iranian officials who repress peaceful protests.  Another U.S. official said a coherent policy response to events in Iran cannot be formulated until Washington has a better understanding of the composition of the protesters, the breadth of the economic and political grievances that are driving them, and what threat they pose to the government.  The United States has had no diplomatic presence in Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, limiting its ability to interpret events.  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington\u2019s main effort now was \u201ctrying to get a sense of who is mostly behind this, how large it is and does it have legs.\u201d  Reporting by Warren Strobel and Arshad Mohammed; additional reporting by John Walcott, Jonathan Landay and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by John Walcott and Grant McCool"

          "body": "Jan 3 (Reuters) - Miners gave Australian shares a jump-start on Wednesday, supported by rallying metal prices, while investors were also cheered by Wall Street\u2019s strong start to 2018.  The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.2 percent, or 11 points, to 6,072.3 by 0026 GMT. The benchmark had closed marginally lower on its first day of trade in the year.  \u201cWe saw pretty strong Chinese data yesterday... so commodity prices are strong, with a weak U.S. dollar, and that\u2019s pretty positive for resources,\u201d said Mathan Somasundaram, market portfolio strategist at Blue Ocean Equities.  Growth in China\u2019s manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December as factories cranked up production to meet a surge in new orders, a private business survey showed on Tuesday.  U.S. stocks rose in the first session of the new year and the Nasdaq closed above 7,000 for the first time on Tuesday as investors were optimistic that 2018 will bring more gains for the market.  In Australia, bellwethers of the mining sector led the climb, with BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto gaining 2.3 percent to 2.4 percent, respectively.  BHP rose to its highest level since May 2015 and was headed for its seventh straight session of gains, while Rio clocked a near six-and-a-half year high and looked set to post its 11th session in positive territory.  Chinese steel futures rose on the first trading day of the new year, while London copper was pushed higher on bets that demand in top consumer China will improve in 2018.  The Australian metals and mining index rallied for a 15th consecutive session, rising 2 percent to its best position in nearly five years.  Strong gold prices drove miners of the metal higher, with the gold index touching its best level in over a year.  Meanwhile, shares of Insurance Australia Group Ltd posted its sharpest drop in four weeks after the company cut its catastrophe reinsurance coverage for the 2018 calendar year.  New Zealand\u2019s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index ushered in the new year with a bang, with dairy and industrial stocks pushing the bourse to a record high on its first day of trade in 2018.  The index posted a 22 percent gain in 2017 - its best year since 2012, largely carried by solid gains in dairy company A2 Milk, which climbed 278.9 percent in its strongest ever year.  A2 Milk rose 2.5 percent to a four-week high on Wednesday, while Auckland International Airport Ltd logged its biggest intraday percentage gain in more than two weeks.

          "body": "(Repeats Jan 2 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)  * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2CduGpC  By John Kemp  LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are the most bullish about oil prices in years, expecting further gains even as prices touch multi-year highs and ignoring the risk linked to such a large concentration of positions.  A record net long position has been accumulated by hedge funds and other money managers, amounting to 1,183 million barrels in the five biggest futures and options contracts covering crude, gasoline and heating oil.  Portfolio managers held a record 1,328 million barrels of long positions in Brent, WTI, U.S. gasoline and U.S. heating oil on Dec. 26, according to data published by regulators and exchanges.  By contrast, hedge funds held only 145 million barrels of short positions, the lowest level for 10 months and among the lowest at any point since the start of 2013.  Fund managers now hold more than nine long positions for every short position, the most bullish picture for at least five years (tmsnrt.rs/2CduGpC).  There are record net long positions in Brent crude (561 million barrels), WTI (461 million barrels) and U.S. heating oil (82 million barrels).  There are also large, if not quite record, net long positions in U.S. gasoline (79 million barrels) and European gasoil (131 million barrels).  In many of these contracts hedge fund positioning appears extremely stretched, with the ratio of long to short positions at multi-year highs.  The concentration of so many bullish positions poses a significant downside risk to prices if and when portfolio managers decide to close them out and realise some of their paper profits.  For the time being, however, most fund managers are ignoring the liquidation risk and focusing on the prospect of further price increases first.  There are plenty of reasons to be bullish about the outlook in 2018. The global economy is in a synchronised upswing and world trade is growing at the fastest rate since the start of the decade.  Stocks of crude and products have fallen significantly since the middle of 2017. Oil demand is growing rapidly while OPEC and its allies have extended their production pact until at least the middle of the year.  History suggests OPEC is more likely to tighten the oil market too much and allow prices to overshoot on the upside than rather than relax production cuts too early and risk prices falling back.  Such was the case after both the previous oil market slumps in 1997/98 and 2008/09, with prices overshooting the producer group\u2019s initial targets.  OPEC\u2019s tightening bias probably explains why many hedge funds remain bullish despite benchmark Brent prices moving towards $70 a barrel.  The main downside risk comes from a resurgence of U.S. shale oil production, with WTI prices now above $60 a barrel.  If shale output starts to climb faster than expected OPEC could be forced to halt production cuts earlier than currently envisaged.  The existence of so many hedge fund long positions could eventually magnify the downside risk posed by U.S. shale.  However, most hedge fund managers seem to have concluded that the risk is some way off and prices have more scope to climb before the inevitable correction.

The 24-year-old Spieth, who clinched his third major title at Royal Birkdale, recognized that he is now under a relentless spotlight, but the three-shot win over fellow American Matt Kuchar had helped release that pressure.  \u201cThe Open Championship just did wonders for me, individually, not only my view of myself but being the man in the arena,\u201d the world number two told reporters in Hawaii ahead of Thursday\u2019s first round at the Tournament of Champions.  \u201cI\u2019m the one out there putting it on the line every week.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Arizona Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL on Tuesday after 15 seasons, leaving the team with two big voids after their head coach made the same decision this week.  The 38-year-old Palmer was drafted first overall in 2003 by the Cincinnati Bengals, where he played eight seasons, and then after a forgettable two-year stint with the Oakland Raiders joined the Cardinals in 2013.  \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve had teammates who decided to hang it up and I would ask them how they knew when it was time to walk away,\u201d Palmer wrote in a statement released by the Cardinals.  \u201cThe answer was almost always the same \u2018you just know\u2019.  \u201cFor me, that time is now. Why? Quite simply, I just know.\u201d  Palmer enjoyed early success with Cincinnati as he led them to a division title in 2005 but on the first snap of his first playoff game he suffered a torn ACL after taking a low hit.  After a lackluster stint in Oakland where he won eight games over two seasons, Palmer rejuvenated his career in Arizona under head coach Bruce Arians\u2019 vertical-passing scheme and alongside future Hall of Fame receiver Larry Fitzgerald.  But Palmer\u2019s career was hampered by injuries, including in the 2014 season when he missed Arizona\u2019s playoff run with a torn ACL.  Palmer, who missed the final nine games of Arizona\u2019s season with a broken arm, ends his NFL career 12th on the all-time rankings with 294 touchdown passes.  He also hold the Cardinals franchise records for passing yards and passing touchdowns in a season, both marks set in 2015.  Arians announced his retirement on Monday and Fitzgerald, 34, has said he does not know if he will return for the NFL\u2019s 2018 season.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ordered the government on Tuesday to either release Iraqi immigrants it arrested last year or grant them bond hearings, in the latest judicial curb on the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to tighten U.S. immigration.  Last year the federal government detained hundreds of Iraqi immigrants who had been ordered deported years ago due to criminal convictions. Iraq until recently had refused to take them back, but struck a deal with the United States in March to repatriate its citizens, sparking the immigration sweeps.  The Iraqis and civil rights groups representing them sued the federal government. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith, in Detroit, had previously halted the deportation of the Iraqis, many of whom are Christian, who argued they would face persecution if they were sent back to Iraq.   In his ruling on Tuesday, Goldsmith said that any of the Iraqis held for six months or longer must either be released or granted a bond hearing before an immigration judge within 30 days.   \u201cOur legal tradition rejects warehousing human beings while their legal rights are being determined,\u201d wrote Goldsmith.  The Trump administration has tried to deport the Iraqis as part of its push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States.  Since June, immigration enforcement officers have detained approximately 300 Iraqi nationals with final deportation orders, according to information provided to the court by the Iraqis\u2019 lawyers. There are approximately 1,400 Iraqis in the United States with final deportation orders.  The U.S. government said in March that Iraq had agreed to repatriate Iraqi nationals ordered deported from the United States.  But Goldsmith noted in his order that the United States has \u201cno written agreement\u201d with Iraq regarding its cooperation, and that it is therefore unclear whether Iraq had agreed to take back all its nationals, and if so, under what conditions.  Goldsmith said his ruling would apply to Iraqi detainees in similar circumstances nationwide, even if they are not involved in the litigation.  \u201c(Goldsmith) just really reaffirmed the principle that indefinite detention in this country is not acceptable,\u201d said Kary Moss, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, which is representing the Iraqis.  The Department of Justice, which is arguing on behalf of the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Leslie Adler"

          "body": "HAVANA (Reuters) - Priests from Cuba\u2019s Afro-Cuban Santeria religion forecast on Tuesday that the upcoming retirement of President Raul Castro would signify \u201ca moment of change\u201d that accelerates the pace of reform on the Communist-run island.  The ritual-filled religion, which fuses Catholicism with ancient African beliefs brought to Cuba by slaves, is practiced by millions of Cubans, many of whom eagerly await guidance from its annual forecast.  V\u00edctor Betancourt, a babalawo or Santeria priest, and member of the commission that writes the \u201cLetter of the Year\u201d containing prophesies and recommendations for followers, was upbeat at a news conference following the release of the letter.  \u201cI am sure this is a moment of change, a moment that can favor us, first of all because it is under the divinity of Yemaya, the Orisha (goddess) of feeding,\u201d he said, \u201cand really that is what we need.\u201d  In a broader sense, Yemaya\u00a0is goddess of the seas and of water, and is considered one of the most powerful and positive deities.  Castro, 86, said last month he would step down as president in April. He took over in 2008 after his brother Fidel Castro, who had governed Cuba since leading the 1959 revolution, became seriously ill. Fidel Castro died in 2016.  \u201cWe hope that the new leader will bring new reforms,\u201d Betancourt said. \u201cWe are betting on reforms of the laws, in the food and health system, in social education that is contaminating the minds of the youth.\u201d  First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel, 57, is widely seen as Castro\u2019s successor.   \u201cIt is a moment of change ... to make changes. A time to change schemes that really do us harm,\u201d Betancourt said.  Cuba has been immersed for a decade in efforts to transform its Soviet-style economy in hopes of improving the country\u2019s sluggish performance.  But bureaucratic resistance has slowed progress toward a more market-oriented system and the crisis in ally Venezuela has left Cuba hard-pressed to pay for imports and recapitalize infrastructure.  The Letter of the Year prophesied \u201chealth in the complete sense of the term,\u201d and urged followers to \u201cmaintain a good social and moral conduct.\u201d  Writing by Marc Frank; Editing by Peter Cooney"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday refused to order a mistrial in the case of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank who is charged with helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions.  U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan federal court rejected arguments by Atilla\u2019s lawyers that the trial was tainted when prosecutors asked Atilla, during a Dec. 19 cross-examination, whether he remembered that a report by a Turkish expert had concluded he violated sanctions.  Atilla\u2019s lawyers objected before Atilla could answer, saying the question involved hearsay and \u201cgrossly mischaracterized\u201d the Turkish expert\u2019s conclusion. Berman told the jury to disregard it.  Atilla\u2019s lawyers moved for a mistrial on Dec. 20.  Berman said on Tuesday that his instruction to the jury was enough to prevent any unfairness to Atilla, adding that a mistrial was an \u201cextreme\u201d outcome that should be avoided whenever possible. Berman had already denied another motion by Atilla for a mistrial earlier in the case.  A lawyer for Atilla could not immediately be reached for comment.  Jurors are expected to come to court on Wednesday for their fourth day of deliberations in the case, which has strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey.  At the center of the three-week trial was testimony from Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions and testified for U.S. prosecutors.  Zarrab testified that Atilla helped design fraudulent gold and food transactions that allowed Iran to spend its oil and gas revenues abroad, including through U.S. financial institutions, defying U.S. sanctions.  Zarrab also implicated Turkish officials in the scheme, including President Tayyip Erdogan.  Attempts to reach Erdogan\u2019s spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful. Erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government.  Atilla has denied all of the charges against him.  Halkbank has denied taking part in any illegal transactions.  The first request for a mistrial came after jurors heard testimony from Huseyin Korkmaz, a former Turkish police officer who said he led an investigation that included Atilla and fled Turkey in fear of retaliation. Atilla\u2019s lawyers said the testimony unfairly associated their client with political violence.  U.S. prosecutors charged nine people in the criminal case, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, were arrested by U.S. authorities.

          "title": "Oil hits highest since mid-2015 but settles down as outages abate",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices hit mid-2015 highs in early trading on Tuesday but dipped to settle slightly lower as major pipelines in Libya and the UK restarted and U.S production soared to the highest level in more than four decades.   It was the first time since January 2014 that the two crude oil benchmarks opened a year above $60 per barrel. Prices were buoyed by large anti-government rallies in Iran and supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled 5 cents lower at $60.37 a barrel. In early trading WTI hit $60.74, the highest level since June 2015.  Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark, settled 30 cents, or 0.5 percent lower at $66.57 a barrel. The session high of $67.29 was the highest since May 2015.      The spread between U.S. crude and Brent WTCLc1-LCoc1 hit the narrowest in nearly two weeks.   The 450,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity Forties pipeline system in the North Sea returned to full operations on Dec. 30 after an unplanned shutdown.  Repairs have been completed on a Libyan oil pipeline damaged in a suspected attack last week and production is restarting gradually, engineers said.  \u201cThe resolution of the North Sea pipeline issue is having the expected result that the Brent-WTI spread is narrowing today,\u201d David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington.  Thompson added that traders have been returning to work from the holidays, boosting volumes.  \u201cDespite the day\u2019s price weakness, both Brent and WTI remain in solid, long-term bullish trends - $58.95 is nearby support on WTI front-month futures and $65.60 is the corresponding support on front-month Brent futures.\u201d  Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader on Tuesday accused the country\u2019s enemies of stirring unrest, as the death toll rose to 21 from anti-government demonstrations that began last week.[nL8N1OX0XY]   Iran is OPEC\u2019s third-largest crude producer. Iranian oil industry and shipping sources said protests have had no impact so far on oil production or exports.  \u201cGeopolitical risks are clearly back on the crude oil agenda after having been absent almost entirely since the oil market ran into a surplus in the second half of 2014,\u201d Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, said, also citing Kurdistan and Libya.  Oil prices have been supported by production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The cuts are scheduled to cover all of 2018.  U.S. commercial crude oil inventories have fallen by almost 20 percent from their historic highs last March, to 431.9 million barrels.  Strong demand growth, especially from China, has also been supporting crude.  However, rising U.S. production, which is on the verge of breaking through 10 million bpd, has tempered the bullish outlook.  \u201cWe think U.S. tight oil production growth warrants close monitoring as it could spoil OPEC\u2019s market-balancing efforts, pushing the market into surplus in 2018,\u201d Barclays bank said.  October U.S crude production rose 167,000 barrels per day to 9.64 million bpd, according to the EIA\u2019s monthly production report. If the figure is not revised next month, it would be the highest monthly level since May 1971.  Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore; editing by David Gregorio and Susan Thomas"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urged the nation\u2019s railroads and transit agencies to take all possible measures to meet deadlines to install a safety system called positive train control (PTC) to prevent crashes.  Letters dated Dec. 27, which were made public on Tuesday, said Chao wanted railroads to \u201cgreatly accelerate\u201d efforts to meet congressional deadlines. A deadly Amtrak crash last month near Seattle that killed three occurred on a section of track that did not have the PTC system operating.  The system is designed to prevent derailments caused by excessive speed. Investigators have said several deadly U.S. train crashes in recent years could have been prevented if the system was in place.  In 2008, Congress mandated the implementation of PTC nationwide by the end of 2015, then extended that deadline until the end of 2018 when its installation became more complex than anticipated. The government can extend the deadline to 2020 to complete some aspects of the system.  The National Transportation Safety Board said last month the Amtrak train that derailed onto a highway near Seattle was going 78 miles per hour (125.5 km per hour) in a 30-mph zone.   The letters went to the chief executives of railroads, including Amtrak, BNSF Railway Co, Canadian National Railway (CNR.TO), CSX Corp (CSX.O), Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N), Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) and transit systems in Chicago, Boston, New York, Boston, Newark, Seattle and Los Angeles.  Amtrak said last month it was \u201cimperative that the rail industry urgently work together to get PTC activated on the national network as soon as possible - and certainly by the December 2018 federal deadline, if not before.\u201d  The Transportation Department said 12 of 41 railroads covered by the requirements report having installed less than 50 percent of the hardware required for their PTC systems as of Sept. 30. The government said the systems are in operation on 45 percent of route miles owned by freight railroads and just 24 percent of passenger railroads  Chao\u2019s letter said the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) leadership plans to work with railroads \u201cto help create an increased level of urgency to underscore the imperative of meeting existing timeline expectations for rolling out this critical rail-safety technology.\u201d  The Association of American Railroads said on Tuesday that railroads are making progress on installing and testing PTC technology and freight railroads are on track to meet the deadlines established by Congress.   Separately, the Transportation Department wrote to U.S. senators on Tuesday asking them to approve the nomination of Ronald Batory to head the FRA. Batory, a former Conrail president, was approved unanimously by a committee but has been held up due to a dispute over a New York area infrastructure project.

The supply, which was 3.2 percent lower than in 2016, got a last-minute boost from issuers racing to the market in late November and in December to sell certain types of tax-exempt bonds at risk in federal tax legislation signed into law on Dec. 22 by President Donald Trump.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in the first session of the new year and the Nasdaq closed above 7,000 for the first time on Tuesday as investors were optimistic that 2018 will bring more gains for the market.  The Nasdaq, driven by gains in Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), breached 6,000 in April of last year and closed above 5,000 in 2015 for the first time in 15 years. The technology index .SPLRCT added 1.4 percent on Tuesday, following a 37-percent surge in 2017 that made it the best-performing S&P 500 sector.  The S&P 500 also hit a record high close. Besides technology, S&P consumer discretionary, healthcare, energy and materials indexes all were up more than 1 percent on the day.  Major stock indexes closed out 2017 with their best performances since 2013. Many investors say the rally could continue this year with help from the recently approved U.S. tax overhaul that is anticipated to boost profits as well as the economy.  \u201cWe\u2019re off to the races once again,\u201d said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect the kind of moves we saw last year. But as long as monetary policy stays the way it is ... my view is stocks are going to have a decent year. And fiscal policy has become stimulative, as well, given the tax bill.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 104.79 points, or 0.42 percent, to 24,824.01, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 22.18 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,695.79 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 103.51 points, or 1.5 percent, to 7,006.90.  \u201cOur best guess is the first quarter or half of the year can be OK as a continuation of last year,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  But, he said, \u201cvaluations are still stretched, interest rates are still rising, and those will provide headwinds to the market at some point.\u201d   The S&P consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD was up 1.5 percent, helped by a gain in Amazon of 1.7 percent.  J.C. Penney (JCP.N), Nordstrom (JWN.N) and Kohl\u2019s (KSS.N) climbed after a bullish Citigroup note on the retail sector detailed benefits from the corporate tax cuts.  Energy shares were up even though oil prices dipped. Oil hovered near mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in major exporter Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia. The S&P energy index .SPNY rose 1.8 percent.  Shares of casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO.O) were down after a report showed a lower-than-expected rise in Macau gambling revenue in December.  Abbott Labs (ABT.N) jumped 3 percent and hit an intraday record of $59.20 after two brokerages upgraded the company\u2019s stock to \u201coverweight.\u201d  Shares of insurer Allstate (ALL.N) were down 2.7 percent following a brokerage downgrade.

It advised customers to sign up for the premium cable network\u2019s $8.99 online video service if they want to continue getting its programing.   It is unusual for a cable company to direct customers to a network\u2019s online streaming service. But it could help cable and satellite companies during carriage disputes because it is easier to weather a blackout when subscribers can get the content directly online, Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson said in an email.      The move by a cable company to direct customers toward a streaming service demonstrates how negotiations between programmers and distributors are getting more contentious as the number of pay TV subscribers continues to drop.  Six U.S. cable providers, including Altice, said they lost more than 1.6 million subscribers through the third quarter of 2017.  \u201cThis is highly unusual,\u201d said John Janedis, an analyst with Jefferies. \u201cWe could be embarking on a new path for distributors.\u201d   Altice is replacing Starz with channels such as Hallmark Drama, Cowboy Channel, Sony Movies and MGM HD.  Starz, which is owned by Lionsgate and has popular shows including \u201cOutlander\u201d and \u201cPower,\u201d in a statement urged customers to demand refunds from Altice.  Altice sells HBO and CBS\u2019 All Access streaming services with its broadband Internet service without requiring the purchase of a bundle of cable channels, but it does not sell the Starz service broadband-only homes.   Jefferies noted that the financial impact of Altice\u2019s move on Lionsgate was modest. Lionsgate shares closed at $33.01 on Tuesday, down 2.36 percent.   If Starz loses all one million of Altice\u2019s subscribers, it would need to bring in 700,000 online streaming customers to its service, which currently has about 2 million subscribers, to break even, according to Jefferies.   Dish Network Corp in November used a similar tactic when it pointed customers to CBS\u2019s All Access online streaming service, as part of a carriage dispute that was resolved within days.  The tactics demonstrate the pressure that distributors are under, Janedis said.   \u201cThey are all spending significantly more on programing to drive subscribers so they need to find the best way to maximize their programing spend,\u201d he said.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in the first session of the new year and the Nasdaq closed above 7,000 for the first time on Tuesday as investors were optimistic that 2018 will bring more gains for the market.  The Nasdaq, driven by gains in Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), breached 6,000 in April of last year and closed above 5,000 in 2015 for the first time in 15 years. The technology index .SPLRCT added 1.4 percent on Tuesday, following a 37-percent surge in 2017 that made it the best-performing S&P 500 sector.  The S&P 500 also hit a record high close. Besides technology, S&P consumer discretionary, healthcare, energy and materials indexes all were up more than 1 percent on the day.  Major stock indexes closed out 2017 with their best performances since 2013. Many investors say the rally could continue this year with help from the recently approved U.S. tax overhaul that is anticipated to boost profits as well as the economy.  \u201cWe\u2019re off to the races once again,\u201d said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect the kind of moves we saw last year. But as long as monetary policy stays the way it is ... my view is stocks are going to have a decent year. And fiscal policy has become stimulative, as well, given the tax bill.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 104.79 points, or 0.42 percent, to 24,824.01, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 22.18 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,695.79 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 103.51 points, or 1.5 percent, to 7,006.90.  \u201cOur best guess is the first quarter or half of the year can be OK as a continuation of last year,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  But, he said, \u201cvaluations are still stretched, interest rates are still rising, and those will provide headwinds to the market at some point.\u201d   The S&P consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD was up 1.5 percent, helped by a gain in Amazon of 1.7 percent.  J.C. Penney (JCP.N), Nordstrom (JWN.N) and Kohl\u2019s (KSS.N) climbed after a bullish Citigroup note on the retail sector detailed benefits from the corporate tax cuts.  Energy shares were up even though oil prices dipped. Oil hovered near mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in major exporter Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia. The S&P energy index .SPNY rose 1.8 percent.  Shares of casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO.O) were down after a report showed a lower-than-expected rise in Macau gambling revenue in December.  Abbott Labs (ABT.N) jumped 3 percent and hit an intraday record of $59.20 after two brokerages upgraded the company\u2019s stock to \u201coverweight.\u201d  Shares of insurer Allstate (ALL.N) were down 2.7 percent following a brokerage downgrade.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said on Tuesday he will not seek re-election in November, opening the door to a potential Senate bid by Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate and one of the party\u2019s harshest critics of President Donald Trump.  \u201cEvery good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching,\u201d Hatch said in a video statement posted on Twitter. \u201cThat\u2019s why after much prayer and discussion with family and friends, I\u2019ve decided to retire at the end of this term.\u201d  Hatch, 83, of Utah, is the most senior Republican in the U.S. Senate, having first been elected in 1976. He is chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. Trump has credited him with helping shepherd a massive tax overhaul through Congress last month.  Hatch steps down amid speculation that Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who ran against Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012, would run for his Senate seat. Romney, who is a Mormon, has close ties to Utah, a state with a majority-Mormon population.  In a statement on Twitter, Romney praised Hatch for his service but he did not say if he would enter the Senate race.  A close Romney adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hatch\u2019s decision increased the odds that Romney would consider jumping in, saying that Romney would likely decide relatively soon whether to seek the Senate seat in the Republican-leaning state.  If he does decide to mount a campaign, Romney, who gained national prominence as head of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, would be the front-runner, said Republican strategist Joe Brettell.    \u201cRomney\u2019s name ID, fund-raising network and business acumen will immediately vault him to the top of the Senate GOP list,\u201d Brettell said. \u201cThe question is whether he can happily weather a body currently known more for partisan rancor than the Mr. Fixit role he\u2019s played all his life.\u201d   In a tweet, Trump congratulated Hatch on \u201can absolutely incredible career.\u201d Trump called Hatch a \u201ctremendous supporter\u201d and said he will be \u201cgreatly missed\u201d in the Senate.  Trump said last month he wanted Hatch to run for another six-year Senate term in 2018, in a slap at Romney, who was one of Trump\u2019s harshest Republican critics during the 2016 presidential campaign.

          "body": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Tie-up talks between Boeing Co (BA.N) and Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA) have not settled key questions such as control of the Brazilian planemaker or the possibility of a more narrow joint venture, two people familiar with the negotiations told Reuters, pushing back against a newspaper report on Tuesday.  Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico had reported that the talks have focused on joint ventures and joint business agreements to share costs and revenue or develop new products without changing control of Embraer.  Such an arrangement could ease approval from the Brazilian government, which holds a \u2018golden share\u2019 giving it veto rights over strategic decisions at Embraer and has expressed reservations about a foreign company taking control.  However, a joint venture may not be an effective way to combine engineering resources, explore new business opportunities and satisfy Boeing\u2019s interest in Embraer\u2019s portfolio of regional passenger jets, defense programs and business aircraft, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of talks.   Boeing has worked around concerns in foreign markets before, structuring defense subsidiaries in Australia and Britain to satisfy sovereignty demands, and those cases may serve as a reference in Brazil, the sources said.  Neither Boeing nor Embraer responded to requests for comment.  On Dec. 21, the two planemakers said they were discussing a \u201cpotential combination,\u201d in a move that could consolidate a global passenger jet duopoly.  The talks are widely seen as a way for Boeing to strengthen its position in the regional jetliner market, in which Embraer is strong, thanks largely to its 70- to 130-seat E-Jets.   Less than three months ago, Boeing\u2019s European arch-rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc\u2019s (BBDb.TO) 100- to 130-seat CSeries jet, putting pressure on the U.S. planemaker to seek a similar partnership.  The Boeing-Embraer talks involve Embraer\u2019s defense business, as well as its passenger business, sources have said.  In the Tuesday report, Valor said Boeing was confident it could convince Brazil\u2019s government that it could safely operate in Brazil\u2019s defense sector, partially by pointing to defense deals the U.S. planemaker has made in countries such as Australia.

Frigid temperatures in U.S. Plains cattle producing areas also supported futures as such weather could slow down cattle weight gains, making them less available to packers.  Actively traded February live cattle settled 1.800 cents per pound higher at 123.350 cents, ending near its session high and at its loftiest level since Dec. 1.  \u201cCash trades late on Friday were a couple of dollars higher and futures are responding to that,\u201d said Jeff French, broker with Top Third Ag Marketing.  \u201cAnd the cold temperatures were reason enough not to sell the futures today,\u201d he added.  Slaughter-ready cattle at U.S. Plains feedlot markets traded around $122 to $124 per cwt on Friday after futures markets had closed for the Christmas holiday weekend. Cattle had traded at $119 to $120 the previous week.  This week\u2019s cash cattle sales could be $1 to $2 higher, traders said.  The choice wholesale beef price on Tuesday rose $2.24 per cwt to $205.14, while the select cutout jumped $3.59 to $197.57 per cwt, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.  Feeder cattle futures rallied more than 2 percent on spillover strength from live cattle and on technical buying.  January feeders closed up 3.525 cents per pound at 149.525 cents while actively traded March ended up 4.200 cents at 146.875 cents. Both contracts left chart gaps as they rallied and breached their 100-day moving averages, and both closed near session highs.  Lean hog futures ended mixed as traders unwound bull spreads and as nearby contracts shed some of their premium to cash markets, traders said.  CME February lean hogs closed 1.050 cents lower at 70.725 cents and April ended down 0.800 cent at 74.850 cents. The June 2018 through February 2019 contracts all closed higher.  Cash hogs in the closely followed Iowa and southern Minnesota market traded slightly higher on Tuesday, according to USDA data, but prices from $54.50 to $60.50 per cwt were well below spot futures.  Cold weather in the Midwest was less of a concern for hog producers as most animals are raised indoors and, thus, at less of a risk of slower weight gain. However, movement of pigs to packing plants is more difficult in cold weather. (Reporting by Karl Plume; eDITING BY tOM bROWN)"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers opened the new year by raising U.S. prices on dozens of medicines, but early data showed the increases generally remained within a 10 percent self-imposed limit in response to a backlash from consumers and politicians.  Soaring U.S. prices for both branded and generic drugs have sparked public outrage and government investigations over the past few years.   \u201cDrug price increases are somewhat more constrained in 2017 and 2018 than they have been previously,\u201d Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said.  Allergan Inc (AGN.N) raised prices on 18 different drugs, including dry eye treatment Restasis and irritable bowel syndrome drug Linzess, by 9.5 percent, according to a research note released by Jefferies on Tuesday.   Jefferies cited data collected by Medi-Span Price Rx and refers to list price increases, before potentially significant discounts and rebates that drugmakers provide to win preferred coverage by insurers. Medi-Span did not respond to requests to confirm the data.  Allergan\u2019s chief executive, Brent Saunders, in late 2016 pledged to keep price increases below 10 percent as part of what he called the company\u2019s \u201cSocial Contract with Patients.\u201d  Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the increases will be the only ones taken on those brands in 2018, adding that discounts to various payers should bring the actual increases to consumers down to the low single digits.  Other drugmakers raising prices include Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc (TEVA.TA) (TEVA.N) and Horizon Pharma (HZNP.O), according to Jefferies and Cowen. Amgen raised the price on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug Enbrel by 9.7 percent and Teva increased prices on its ProAir HFA and ProAir RespiClick asthma inhalers by 6 and 3 percent, respectively.  Drug price increases are coming under more scrutiny from states. California Governor Jerry Brown in October signed legislation requiring drug manufacturers to give 60-day notice if prices are raised more than 16 percent over a two-year period.

          "title": "At heart of FDIC\u2019s win v. PwC, an unsettled theory",
          "body": "(Reuters) - The accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers is facing hundreds of millions of dollars in exposure to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein ruled last week that PwC negligently failed to uncover a $2.3 billion fraud scheme between PwC audit client Colonial Bank, now in FDIC receivership, and the now bankrupt mortgage lender Taylor, Bean & Whitaker. PwC already paid an undisclosed amount in 2016 to settle related claims by Taylor Bean's trustee.  Judge Rothstein, who is based in Seattle but oversaw a 2017 bench trial in Montgomery, Alabama, of the FDIC\u2019s claims, concluded that PwC \u2013 by its own admission in the Taylor Bean bankruptcy trustee\u2019s case \u2013 failed to design and perform its Colonial Bank audits to detect fraud. Her decision marks the first time a federal district judge has found an audit firm liable under the Sarbanes-Oxley act for failing to detect a fraud.  Among PwC\u2019s shortcomings, according to Judge Rothstein: The auditor relied on the chief architect of the fraud, Taylor Bean chair Lee Farkas, to verify key information about the collateral underlying a Colonial credit facility for Taylor Bean. PwC also signed off on Colonial\u2019s audit without ever understanding the third and most complex iteration of the fraud, which involved a credit facility based on phantom mortgage securitizations. After an auditor who was supposed to make sense of the transactions gave up, saying they were \u201cabove his pay grade,\u201d PwC assigned a college-aged intern to evaluate the nearly $600 million asset.  Judge Rothstein was distinctly harsh about PwC\u2019s failings. Basing Colonial\u2019s certification on Farkas\u2019 account of Taylor Bean\u2019s collateral was \u201cquintessentially the same as asking the fox to report on the condition of the hen house,\u201d she wrote. And charging an intern to decipher a loan facility beyond the expertise of a senior auditor was a \u201ctruly astonishing\u201d departure from PwC\u2019s mandate, the judge wrote.  But Judge Rothstein let PwC off the hook for several other claims based on the same allegations that it failed to detect fraud machinations between Colonial and Taylor Bean, which began in 2002. PwC\u2019s auditing, she found, was actively undermined by executives at Colonial, two of whom have pleaded guilty in connection with the scheme.  Taylor Bean was one of Colonial\u2019s most important customers, Judge Rothstein said, and the bank was at first eager to help the mortgage lender survive overdrafts. Later, as the fraud ballooned, Colonial execs frantically tried to recoup Colonial\u2019s money from Taylor Bean. According to the judge\u2019s decision, over the course of several years, to keep the scheme secret, Colonial execs lied to PwC auditors, circumvented internal controls by \u201crecycling\u201d mortgage data and even created wire transfers to trick PwC into believing Taylor Bean collateral mortgages had been paid off.  Because the Colonial employees were acting as agents of the bank and its holding company, Colonial BancGroup, neither the FDIC nor the holding company, CBG, is entitled to breach of contract damages against PwC, the judge held. CBG didn\u2019t keep up its end of the deal, according to Judge Rothstein. It should have, or at least could have, known something fishy was going on, yet it didn\u2019t alert PwC.  The judge also said CBG can\u2019t hold PwC liable for negligence even though PwC breached its professional duties to the holding company. CBG\u2019s negligence claim, Rothstein held, is barred under the doctrine of in pari delicto, which precludes a wrongdoer from sharing in the proceeds of its misdeeds, and under the \u201caudit interference rule,\u201d which holds that an audit client can\u2019t recover if its own negligent or wrongful actions contributed to the auditor\u2019s failures.  You may be thinking, as I was when I read Judge Rothstein\u2019s decision, that it seems contradictory. Colonial participated in the fraud so it can\u2019t get damages from PwC for breaching the audit contract and its holding company can\u2019t claim PwC was negligent. So why don\u2019t in pari delicto and auditor interference bar the FDIC, as Colonial\u2019s receiver, from obtaining damages for PwC\u2019s negligence?  It turns out there\u2019s no consensus across the country on that question. Last August, Judge Rothstein ruled\u00a0PwC and a second Colonial auditor, Crowe Horwath, could not evade liability to the FDIC by citing Colonial\u2019s own involvement in the fraud. She said the scope of the auditors\u2019 in pari delicto offense is a matter of state law that has never been addressed by Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court. But as she interpreted Alabama precedent on the power of receivers, Judge Rothstein said, she believed the state high court would allow the FDIC to pursue negligence claims against PwC despite the misdeeds of Colonial employees.  \u201cPWC and Crowe contend that even if they failed to comply with their professional duties when they audited Colonial, they cannot be held liable because the conduct of Colonial employees\u2014the very conduct that PWC and Crowe were hired to examine and verify\u2014was fraudulent and/or negligent,\u201d the judge wrote in the August ruling. \u201cThis court does not believe the Supreme Court of Alabama would reach such a conclusion. Imputation is a flexible, equitable doctrine, the primary purpose of which is to preclude suits that would benefit wrongdoers\u2026. To hold otherwise would be to elevate form over substance-something courts sitting in equity traditionally will not do.\u201d  Judge Rothstein cited precedent from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1995\u2019s FDIC v. O\u2019Melveny & Myers\u00a0and the 4th Circuit\u2019s Grant Thornton v. FDIC\u00a0to back her holding. But she also acknowledged contrary holdings by the 7th Circuit, federal trial courts in Colorado and Maryland and Chancery Court in Delaware. \u201cCourts in other jurisdictions have not been universal in refusing to impute a failed institution's misconduct and/or negligence to the receiver,\u201d Judge Rothstein wrote.  PwC asked the judge for a stay to bring an interlocutory appeal of her August ruling. She denied it, which means the audit firm will now have to wait until she enters a judgment for the FDIC. She plans to hold a bench trial on damages on the negligence claims for which she held PwC liable but has not yet scheduled it. Judge Rothstein is also hearing a bench trial on Crowe Horwath\u2019s liability.  PwC certainly plans to keep the issue alive. In its statement on Judge Rothstein\u2019s liability ruling, the auditor noted her finding that several Colonial employees \u201cactively and substantially interfered with PricewaterhouseCooper\u2019s audit,\u201d the auditor said. \u201cThe FDIC was only able to prevail on the claims that it did based on an earlier novel ruling by the court that immunized the FDIC from imputation defenses. PricewaterhouseCoopers intends to appeals that novel ruling at the earliest possible opportunity.\u201d PwC was represented by Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar & Scott.  The FDIC had lawyers from Thomas, Alexander, Forrester & Sorensen; Schiff Hardin; and Mullin Hoard & Brown. CBG was represented by Parker Hudson Rainer & Dobbs and DiCarlo Caserta & McKeighan.

It was unclear immediately who would replace her.  \u201cUSCIS is grateful to Barbara Strack for her 26 years of distinguished federal service,\u201d Langston said.  The Refugee Affairs Division, which Strack oversees, includes dozens of officers charged with interviewing refugees abroad for resettlement in the United States.   The Trump administration has slashed the number of refugees allowed into the country and put in place new vetting and security requirements that have created an additional barrier. Last year, the administration said it planned to divert some refugee officers to instead interview asylum applicants already in the United States, in an effort to cut down on a burgeoning backlog of asylum cases.   Administration officials cited the asylum backlog as one reason it was necessary to cut this year\u2019s refugee admissions cap to 45,000, the lowest level since the modern U.S. refugee program was established in 1980.  Advocates for resettlement and some U.S. officials have expressed alarm at what they see as a slowdown in trips abroad known as circuit rides, in which USCIS officers interview refugees.  \u201cThe number of circuit rides has gone down drastically with currently only a few planned,\u201d said Hans Van de Weerd, chair of Refugee Council USA, a coalition of non-governmental groups working on refugee issues. \u201cMany more will need to be scheduled soon to resettle 45,000 refugees and we don\u2019t have any information about whether they will.\u201d   Langston did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the concerns over circuit rides, or how many had been scheduled so far in the fiscal year. A U.S. official said on condition of anonymity in November that trips had been planned for Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Tanzania and Burundi for the first quarter of the fiscal year.  Opponents of refugee resettlement say it raises national security risks to the United States and is expensive. Advocates say refugees are vetted thoroughly and end up being a boon to their new communities.  Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by David Gregorio"

          "title": "Commentary: The best way to respond to Iran protests",
          "body": "Iran\u2019s deadly wave of protests has taken the government and security forces by surprise.  What started off in the holy city of Mashhad as demonstrations over unpaid wages and inflation quickly spread throughout the country, widening to include grievances about government mismanagement, corruption and Tehran\u2019s involvement in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. Unlike the mainly urban demonstrations that followed the contested 2009 election, these protests have spread to Ahvaz, Kermanshah, Rasht and Qazvin \u2013 all rural and relatively poorer cities.  The national groundswell means that the government must take these demonstrations seriously.  Here are five points for policymakers to consider:  1. Economics 101  The overarching theme of these protests seems to be Iran\u2019s perpetually mismanaged economy. Inflation, unemployment, corruption and years of sanctions have led to a shadow financial system that often benefits elites and leaves the middle class and poor further behind every year. President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s first campaign for the presidency in 2013 was framed in terms of getting a nuclear deal done and unshackling Iran\u2019s economy from years of sanctions. Yet while sanctions certainly exacerbated long-standing structural problems of a mostly state-run economy, they were not the underlying cause of Iran\u2019s woes.  Unemployment today in Iran stands at 12 percent (youth unemployment is above 20 percent). Inflation since the 1979 revolution has fluctuated between 17 percent during the 1980s to a peak of 49 percent percent during the 1990s. In the early 2000s, under the stewardship of reformist President Mohammad Khatami, it was tamed at around 15 percent but then skyrocketed again under firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to 30 percent \u2013 the latter occurring at a time when oil prices were at record highs and Iran\u2019s currency had devalued by more than 450 percent.  To Rouhani's credit, his administration has had some success in taming inflation (it stands at closer to 10 percent today) and Iran\u2019s economy has rebounded considerably since nuclear-related sanctions were lifted two years ago. The IMF recently forecast growth at 4.2 percent this year, after Iran\u2019s economy grew at 7 percent last year. However, it is unclear who has benefited from this improvement. Those protesting have seen their purchasing power decrease as prices have risen and subsides were cut. Rouhani\u2019s supporters argue that it will take time for the average Iranians to feel the benefits of sanctions relief and for the economy to stabilize; those protesting have lost hope that reforms can make their lives better in any meaningful way.  2. The role of Iran\u2019s regional policy  Over the years, many protesters in Iran have chanted slogans against Iran\u2019s activist foreign policy. The slogans amount to this: why is the government spending money on Iraq, Syria and Lebanon and not spending it on its own people?  This is a legitimate grievance, and the fact that it is now being expressed by poorer Iranians traditionally considered to be the regime\u2019s base of support makes it particularly noteworthy.  However, broad segments of Iranian society may not share the protesters\u2019 opposition to Iran\u2019s involvement in these countries. Islamic State and Wahhabi Islam, the state-sponsored religion of Saudi Arabia, are viewed as existential threats by many Iranians. They believe that it\u2019s better to fight Sunni fundamentalism in Iraq and Syria rather than inside Iran\u2019s borders. The attacks last summer by Islamic State on a religious shrine and parliament in Tehran drove this point home. Washington, Riyadh and Tel Aviv should not expect the protests to have an impact on Iran\u2019s regional policies.  3. Trump\u2019s support doesn\u2019t help the protesters  Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to announce his support for the protesters. His words ring hollow. The fact remains that the U.S. president is deeply unpopular among Iranians, who view his administration as hostile to them, not just their government. His travel ban on Iranians has torn families apart and offended Americans who have Iranian relatives no longer able to visit them.  Trump\u2019s refusal to certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal (despite all evidence to the contrary), his attempts to discourage other countries from engaging Iran and his wholesale embrace of Saudi Arabia\u2019s narrative blaming Tehran for all conflicts in the Middle East make him a strange bedfellow for Iran\u2019s protesters.  Foreign interference in Iran\u2019s internal affairs has left deep scars in the consciousness of the Iranian public for decades. The Trump administration should be mindful of exploiting the demonstrations and risk tainting the protesters as foreign agents, an easy tagline the regime uses to discredit dissidents.  4. What will happen next?  It\u2019s difficult to say at this nascent stage. The protests have been small and scattered. No indigenous leadership has been identified. Most Iranians have chosen to stay away for fear of reprisals \u2013 at least 14 people have died and hundreds have been arrested so far \u2013 or because they prefer to work within a political system they have lived under for 38 years to effect change rather than starting from scratch.  It is vital for President Rouhani to listen to the grievances of the demonstrators. He needs to deliver on his campaign promises of economic and social reforms. That means confronting elements of the deep state, nepotism and corruption. He can even utilize these protests to strengthen his mandate. Given the political upheaval and instability that has taken over the region since the Arab spring, it\u2019s doubtful that most Iranians would prefer revolution to meaningful reform. What is certain is that they want their daily needs met and less government involvement in their personal lives.  5. The fallout for Iranian politics  Despite the portrayal of Iranian politics as a monolith by many Western analysts, it is highly factionalized with competing power centers and a myriad of special interests. Expect hard-line factions close to Ebrahim Raisi, Rouhani\u2019s main rival in last year\u2019s election, and the security services to blame President Rouhani for the protests. They will portray his government as having failed the urban poor and exaggerating the benefits of the nuclear deal. On the other side, expect Rouhani supporters to blame hard-line factions for blocking needed economic reforms and stifling the relaxation of Islamic dress code on women.  Both groups will aim to influence the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, who will stay above the fray \u2013 at least in public. He will reprimand all sides for using the protests for political gain. He will blame outsiders, particularly those in the West for fomenting instability. In private, however, he should back Rouhani and give him the latitude to aggressively pursue his agenda. He should remind hardliners that time and demographics are not on their side as 60 percent of Iran\u2019s population is under 30. If the government\u2019s only response is to contain the protests by force, more will follow.

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Hollywood stars including Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Chastain and Natalie Portman have backed a campaign against sexual harassment called Time\u2019s Up as donations flood in for a multi-million dollar legal fund to fight abuse cases in the workplace.  In an open letter in the New York Times, they said they particularly wanted to \u201clift up the voices\u201d of women in low-wage industries whose lack of financial stability left them vulnerable to exploitation.  \u201cI stand with ALL WOMEN across every industry to say #TIMESUP on abuse, harassment, materialization and underrepresentation,\u201d tweeted Witherspoon who won an Oscar for the Johnny Cash biopic \u201cWalk the Line\u201d.  The campaign comes after a slew of allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein last year sparked the #MeToo campaign, with women and men using social media to talk about their experiences of harassment.  More than 300 show business figures including actors, writers and directors launched the Time\u2019s Up initiative with a full page advert in the New York Times on New Year\u2019s Day, pledging to support workers in all industries fight sexual misconduct.  \u201cLet\u2019s all make this resolution for the year: No more accepting sexual harassment and inequality at work as normal.\u00a0It\u2019s NOT normal,\u201d tweeted actress Jessica Biel.  By early Tuesday the initiative, also backed by Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, had raised nearly $14 million of a $15 million target for a legal fund to help victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.  \u201cWe stand with all those who have endured sexual harassment: those who have come forward and those who have decided to remain quiet. It\u2019s time for change, and we must act now,\u201d the group said on their gofundme page.  \u201cThe voices of those affected in every industry have been silenced for too long.\u201d   They said harassment often continued because those responsible and employers never faced consequences and because of systematic gender inequality.   \u201cThe struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard and acknowledged in male-dominated workplaces must end; time\u2019s up on this impenetrable monopoly,\u201d they said.  The campaign with hashtag #timesup will also push for legislation to penalize companies that tolerate harassment and to discourage the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence victims, according to the New York Times.      \u201cTime\u2019s up on silence. Time\u2019s up on waiting. Time\u2019s up on tolerating discrimination, harassment or abuse,\u201d Oscar winner Portman wrote on Instagram.  Actors are being encouraged to wear black at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday to protest against sexual harassment.

The S&P 500 also ended at a record high. Technology drove the day\u2019s gains, but consumer discretionary, healthcare, energy and materials sectors were also up more than 1 percent each.  Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft pulled the technology index up 1.4 percent, following a 37-percent surge in 2017 that made it the best-performing S&P sector.  Major stock indexes had closed out 2017 with their best performances since 2013. Many investors say the rally could continue this year with help from the recently approved U.S. tax overhaul that is anticipated to boost profits as well as the economy.  \u201cWe\u2019re off to the races once again,\u201d said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect the kind of moves we saw last year.

And fiscal policy has become stimulative, as well, given the tax bill.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104.79 points, or 0.42 percent, to 24,824.01, the S&P 500 gained 22.18 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,695.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 103.51 points, or 1.5 percent, to 7,006.90.  \u201cOur best guess is the first quarter or half of the year can be OK as a continuation of last year,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  But, he said, \u201cvaluations are still stretched, interest rates are still rising, and those will provide headwinds to the market at some point.\u201d  The S&P consumer discretionary index was up 1.5 percent, helped by a gain in Amazon.com of 1.7 percent.  J.C. Penney, Nordstrom and Kohl\u2019s climbed after a bullish Citigroup note on the retail sector detailed benefits from the corporate tax cuts.  Energy shares were up even though oil prices dipped. Oil hovered near mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in major exporter Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia. The S&P energy index rose 1.8 percent.  Shares of casino operators Wynn Resorts and Melco Resorts & Entertainment were down after a report showed lower-than-expected rise in Macau gambling revenue in December.  Abbott Labs jumped 3 percent and hit an intraday record of $59.20 after two brokerages upgraded the company\u2019s stock to \u201coverweight.\u201d  Shares of Allstate were down 2.7 percent on a brokerage downgrade.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges.

MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.74 percent. In 2017 the index set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value.

And fiscal policy has become stimulative as well given the tax bill.\u201d  In Europe, equities closed lower, weighed by a decline in autos stocks following weaker car registrations data. Trading was also cautious ahead of the launch of a major reform of European financial markets.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.21 percent, and euro zone stocks shed 0.19 percent.   Shares rose in Asia. Shanghai blue chips climbed 1.41 percent and MSCI\u2019s 24-country emerging market stock index jumped to a multi-year high after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.29 percent, hampered by expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture.   The dollar hit a three-month low on Friday, bringing its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worst performance since 2003.  Other currencies gained. The euro rose 0.39 percent to $1.2055 and hit a four-month high on Tuesday after data showed that euro zone manufacturers ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.  The Japanese yen strengthened 0.32 percent at 112.29 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3594, up 0.69 percent.  U.S. Treasury yields rose in line with European government yields. A European Central Bank official said the ECB\u2019s massive bond purchase program might not continue later this year.   A reversal of year-end buying has also driven U.S. Treasury yields higher, said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.   \u201cLots of institutions buy Treasuries to hold over year-end for liquidity. To see that reversal early in the year is not a surprise,\u201d Rehling said.  Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.4597 percent, from 2.411 percent late on Friday.  The 30-year bond last fell 43/32 in price to yield 2.8073 percent, from 2.741 percent late on Friday.  Oil prices earlier enjoyed their strongest start to a year since 2014 but fell lower as major pipelines in Libya and Britain\u2019s North Sea restarted and U.S. production soared to the highest level in more than four decades.  U.S. crude last fell 0.1 percent to $60.36 per barrel and Brent was at $66.53, down 0.51 percent.   Copper lost 0.42 percent to $7,216.50 a tonne, following a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - International milk prices posted their sharpest rise since May on Wednesday, as supply tightened in the world\u2019s largest exporter, New Zealand.  The Global Dairy Trade Price Index (GDT) gained 2.2 percent at the first auction of the year, after the world\u2019s biggest dairy processor, Fonterra, dropped its forecast for NZ milk collection last week for the second time in as many months.   The average selling price was of $3,124 per tonne, with prices for whole milk powder - the most widely traded product -  posting the strongest gain, 4.2 percent.      \u201cThere\u2019s a growing realization that it\u2019s quite serious, the situation in New Zealand, and I think prices have reacted to that,\u201d Susan Kilsby, dairy analyst at Agri HQ told Reuters.  \u201cIt\u2019s really dry right across New Zealand\u2019s dairy regions, and that means lower pasture growth and subsequent low milk production.\u201d  Fonterra last week said it expected the dry weather to persist, and cut its collection forecast for the 2017-2018 season by nearly 3 percent. [nL4N1OT21F]  The New Zealand milk co-operative, which is owned by about 10,500 farmers, controls nearly a third of the world dairy trade. It already announced last month it was cutting its forecast payout to farmers for the season by NZ$0.35  ($0.25) to NZ$6.40 per kg of milk solids. [nL3N1O63B7]  Skim milk powder prices rose 1.6 percent, and butter prices rose for the first time since October.  Auction results can affect the New Zealand dollar as the dairy sector generates more than 7 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.  The currency hit a ten-week high of $0.7128 overnight, after the auction, though this was aided by a weakening U.S. dollar.  The GDT index had fallen 3.9 percent to a 15-monnth low at the previous sale, and had dropped in five of the last six auctions, according to GDT Events, which is owned by Fonterra and runs the sale independently of the dairy giant.   A total of 25,400 tonnes was sold at the latest auction, falling 14.2 percent from the previous one, the auction platform said on its website.  A number of companies, including Dairy America and Murray Goulburn, use the platform to sell milk powder and other dairy products, with roughly half of buyers based in China as traders there seek to supplement flagging domestic milk supplies.  The auctions are held twice a month, with the next one scheduled for Jan. 16.  Reporting by Tom Westbrook and Bangalore Commodities desk; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"

Bridgewater Associates, based in Westport, Connecticut, manages $160 billion for about 350 institutional clients such as public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and central banks, according to its website.  In Costa Rica, civil aviation authorities were investigating the plane crash that occurred shortly after takeoff from the airport at the popular beach town of Punta Islita. The Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft was bound for the capital, San Jose.  The other victims were Steinberg\u2019s wife, Irene, and their three sons - Zachary, William and Matthew - as well as five other U.S. citizens and two Costa Rican crew members.  Michael Soto, a Costa Rican police spokesman, said on Tuesday that various possible causes for the crash such as weather, mechanical failure or human failure were still being investigated.  Soto said forensic pathologists and dentists had begun autopsies on the 12 badly burned bodies and that it could take two months or more to finish DNA identification tests.  The work was difficult because of the temperatures to which the bodies were subjected, he added.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite notched record closing highs on Tuesday, the first trading day of 2018, while European equities finished lower and the U.S. dollar fell to its weakest level in over three months against key currencies.   MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.74 percent. In 2017 the index set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value.    Major stock indexes closed 2017 with their best performance since 2013. In the U.S. market, the advance came amid strong economic growth and corporate earnings, low interest rates and hopes, now realized, of U.S. corporate tax cuts.  U.S. equity indexes closed higher on Tuesday, buoyed by gains in technology and consumer discretionary stocks.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104.79 points, or 0.42 percent, to 24,824.01, the S&P 500 gained 22.18 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,695.79, and the Nasdaq Composite added 103.51 points, or 1.5 percent, to 7,006.90.  \u201cWe\u2019re off to the races once again,\u201d said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect the kind of moves we saw last year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as long as monetary policy stays the way it is ... my view is stocks are going to have a decent year. And fiscal policy has become stimulative as well given the tax bill.\u201d  In Europe, equities closed lower, weighed by a decline in autos stocks following weaker car registrations data. Trading was also cautious ahead of the launch of a major reform of European financial markets.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.21 percent, and euro zone stocks shed 0.19 percent.   Shares rose in Asia. Shanghai blue chips climbed 1.41 percent and MSCI\u2019s 24-country emerging market stock index jumped to a multi-year high after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.29 percent, hampered by expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture.   The dollar hit a three-month low on Friday, bringing its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worst performance since 2003.  Other currencies gained. The euro rose 0.39 percent to $1.2055 and hit a four-month high on Tuesday after data showed that euro zone manufacturers ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.  The Japanese yen strengthened 0.32 percent at 112.29 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3594, up 0.69 percent.  U.S. Treasury yields rose in line with European government yields. A European Central Bank official said the ECB\u2019s massive bond purchase program might not continue later this year.   A reversal of year-end buying has also driven U.S. Treasury yields higher, said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.   \u201cLots of institutions buy Treasuries to hold over year-end for liquidity. To see that reversal early in the year is not a surprise,\u201d Rehling said.  Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.4597 percent, from 2.411 percent late on Friday.  The 30-year bond last fell 43/32 in price to yield 2.8073 percent, from 2.741 percent late on Friday.  Oil prices earlier enjoyed their strongest start to a year since 2014 but fell lower as major pipelines in Libya and Britain\u2019s North Sea restarted and U.S. production soared to the highest level in more than four decades.  U.S. crude last fell 0.1 percent to $60.36 per barrel and Brent was at $66.53, down 0.51 percent.   Copper lost 0.42 percent to $7,216.50 a tonne, following a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top.   Spot gold added 1.2 percent to $1,317.69 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.

          "title": "Iran protests could hurt clerics but Rouhani has most to lose, say insiders",
          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian authorities are concerned that nationwide unrest will undermine the clerical establishment and want to stamp out the protests quickly, senior government officials say. But the person with the most to lose is President Hassan Rouhani.  While several senior officials said there was concern that prolonged unrest would damage the legitimacy and influence of the country\u2019s religious leaders, few insiders see the unrest as an existential threat to that leadership, which has ruled since the 1979 revolution and is now controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate authority in Iran\u2019s system of dual clerical and republican rule.  The biggest loser, they say, is likely to be Rouhani, who is much more closely tied to the country\u2019s economic policies.  \u201cOf course Rouhani and his government will have less power afterwards, especially because his economic policy was criticized during the unrest,\u201d said political analyst Hamid Farahvashian.  \u201cHe will be a lame-duck president and Khamenei will have more power.\u201d  Much of the protesters\u2019 anger has focused on what Rouhani and his government have failed to deliver: an economic boom promised as the payoff for the 2015 deal that curbed Iran\u2019s disputed nuclear program in return for world powers lifting sanctions.  Protesters are angry that Iran\u2019s youth unemployment rate is edging towards 30 percent, want higher wages and an end to alleged graft. They have chanted slogans against all of Iran\u2019s leaders, including the clerical elite, and attacked police vehicles, banks and mosques as the unrest widened.  \u201cThe continuation of the protests will lead to a legitimacy crisis,\u201d said one senior official close to Rouhani, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.  \u201cPeople have economic demands ... of course these demands should be taken seriously ... of course the establishment should listen to the people, but all these can be discussed in\u00a0a calm atmosphere,\u201d the official said.  Some conservatives have pushed for a hardline approach, even though bloodshed could fuel more protests in the largest wave of demonstrations since nationwide unrest in 2009.  \u201cSo far, security forces have not tried to prevent the demonstrations .... but this will change if (Khamenei) calls for an end to the street protests and demonstrators defy his call,\u201d said one former Iranian official from the reformist camp.  Even if the unrest is quelled, the demands of tens of thousands of restless working class youths who have taken to the streets are unlikely to dissipate.  Khamenei spoke publicly for the first time about the crisis on Tuesday, accusing Iran\u2019s enemies of stirring unrest but saying no more. A statement on his website said he would address the nation about the events \u201cwhen the time is right\u201d.  The protesters have little chance of toppling the clerical leaders, who appear to be retaining control of the military, police, and security forces and have no compunction about using them, according to one U.S. official following the developments.  Rouhani, who was elected in 2013, is more exposed. He is seen as a pragmatist at odds with Iran\u2019s hardliners and has said in response to the protests that Iranians have a right to criticize the authorities.  But he has a fight on his hands because of growing resentment over high prices and allegations of corruption.  \u201cHis power is limited in Iran\u2019s ruling system.\u00a0Public discontent is increasing ... people are losing their faith in the establishment system,\u201d a third Iranian official said. \u201cThe leaders are well aware of this fact and its dangerous consequences.\u201d  U.S. officials fear the likeliest outcome of the protests is discrediting what one called Rouhani\u2019s \u201cmoderate brand of moderation\u201d and a harsher crackdown by the clerical authorities.  \u201cIt\u2019s an open question whether Rouhani ever intended to keep any of his promises, but he hasn\u2019t delivered, especially on the economic front, and that means he has no popular support and is expendable to Khamenei,\u201d said a second U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.  \u201cHe\u2019s likely to be one of the casualties, though maybe not immediately.\u201d  Rouhani has blamed his predecessor and the United States, Iran\u2019s long-time adversary, for the economy\u2019s shortcomings.  But his government has also backtracked on planned fuel price rises and promised more jobs.  Rouhani may need to spend more money to create more employment if he is to ease discontent, and could risk antagonizing powerful interests if he tries to address allegations of corruption.  His vulnerability and the deep divisions in Iran\u2019s hierarchy have fueled suspicions among some of his sympathizers that conservative rivals may have played a hand in the crisis.  \u201cIt was a coup against Rouhani and his achievements ... The aim was to harm Rouhani,\u201d said Saeed Leylaz, a political analyst close to the pro-reform movement.  But a fourth official in Tehran said the nationwide protests had united Iran\u2019s leadership.   \u201cAt this point it is not important whether a political faction initiated the unrest to harm the rival group,\u201d the official said.  \u201cThe unrest was hijacked by our enemies ... that is why all factions have united to protect the Islamic Republic.\u201d  Additional reporting by John Walcott in Washington and Andrew Torchia in Dubai; Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Nick Tattersall"

          "title": "Dairy prices rise as dry weather crimps NZ production",
          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - International milk prices posted their sharpest rise since May on Wednesday, as supply tightened in the world\u2019s largest exporter, New Zealand.  The Global Dairy Trade Price Index (GDT) gained 2.2 percent at the first auction of the year, after the world\u2019s biggest dairy processor, Fonterra, dropped its forecast for NZ milk collection last week for the second time in as many months.   The average selling price was of $3,124 per tonne, with prices for whole milk powder - the most widely traded product -  posting the strongest gain, 4.2 percent.      \u201cThere\u2019s a growing realization that it\u2019s quite serious, the situation in New Zealand, and I think prices have reacted to that,\u201d Susan Kilsby, dairy analyst at Agri HQ told Reuters.  \u201cIt\u2019s really dry right across New Zealand\u2019s dairy regions, and that means lower pasture growth and subsequent low milk production.\u201d  Fonterra last week said it expected the dry weather to persist, and cut its collection forecast for the 2017-2018 season by nearly 3 percent. [nL4N1OT21F]  The New Zealand milk co-operative, which is owned by about 10,500 farmers, controls nearly a third of the world dairy trade. It already announced last month it was cutting its forecast payout to farmers for the season by NZ$0.35  ($0.25) to NZ$6.40 per kg of milk solids. [nL3N1O63B7]  Skim milk powder prices rose 1.6 percent, and butter prices rose for the first time since October.  Auction results can affect the New Zealand dollar as the dairy sector generates more than 7 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.  The currency hit a ten-week high of $0.7128 overnight, after the auction, though this was aided by a weakening U.S. dollar.  The GDT index had fallen 3.9 percent to a 15-monnth low at the previous sale, and had dropped in five of the last six auctions, according to GDT Events, which is owned by Fonterra and runs the sale independently of the dairy giant.   A total of 25,400 tonnes was sold at the latest auction, falling 14.2 percent from the previous one, the auction platform said on its website.  A number of companies, including Dairy America and Murray Goulburn, use the platform to sell milk powder and other dairy products, with roughly half of buyers based in China as traders there seek to supplement flagging domestic milk supplies.  The auctions are held twice a month, with the next one scheduled for Jan. 16.  Reporting by Tom Westbrook and Bangalore Commodities desk; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Music streaming company Spotify was sued by Wixen Music Publishing Inc last week for allegedly using thousands of songs, including those of Tom Petty, Neil Young and the Doors, without a license and compensation to the music publisher.  Wixen, an exclusive licensee of songs such as \u201cFree Fallin\u201d by Tom Petty, \u201cLight My Fire\u201d by the Doors, \u201c(Girl We Got a) Good Thing\u201d by Weezer and works of singers such as Stevie Nicks, is seeking damages worth\u00a0at least\u00a0$1.6 billion along with injunctive relief.  Spotify failed to get a direct or a compulsory license from Wixen that would allow it to reproduce and distribute the songs, Wixen said in the lawsuit, filed in a California federal court.  Wixen also alleged that Spotify outsourced its work to a third party, licensing and royalty services provider the Harry Fox Agency, which was \u201cill-equipped to obtain all the necessary mechanical licenses\u201d.  Spotify declined to comment.  In May, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company agreed to pay more than $43 million to settle a proposed class action alleging it failed to pay royalties for some of the songs it makes available to users.  Spotify, which is planning a stock market listing this year, has grown around 20 percent in value to at least $19 billion in the past few months.

The Internal Revenue Service said it expected to issue guidance in January on how much in taxes employers should withhold based on the new tax rates. Employers and payroll services would then implement those changes starting in February.   You might not even notice when it happens because the effect on your paycheck could be relatively small, depending on your income and your tax situation.   \u201cWhen the taxes are reduced by 1 to 3 percent, that\u2019s not going to be a huge noticeable difference.

Your paycheck is not actually a clear indicator of whether your overall taxes have gone up or down because of the new tax law. There may be other factors in your tax situation - such as owning a property or having multiple children - that could affect how much you owe Uncle Sam at the end of the year.   Be prepared for tax uncertainty until you do your taxes for 2018 a year or so from now.

A married person with a freelance spouse who owes quarterly taxes might have listed themselves as single to have enough taken out to cover both of them.   The goal of people adjusting their withholding was to come as close as possible to paying the correct amount of tax - rather than owing money at the end of the year or ending up with a giant refund.   But it will all be different math for 2018.   \u201cFor first few weeks of January stay put, and see what the IRS comes out with,\u201d said Isberg, who also cautioned that employees should keep an eye on tax changes at the state level.  Above all, do not panic, said Farsheed Ferdowsi, president and CEO of Inova Payroll, which handles paychecks for more than 3,000 companies.   \u201cWhen you have changes in taxes, it usually goes a lot smoother than most people know,\u201d Ferdowsi said. \u201cIf the first (paycheck) is wrong, it catches up on the next one.\u201d  Editing by Lauren Young and Lisa Shumaker"

Above all, do not panic, said Farsheed Ferdowsi, president and CEO of Inova Payroll, which handles paychecks for more than 3,000 companies.   \u201cWhen you have changes in taxes, it usually goes a lot smoother than most people know,\u201d Ferdowsi said. \u201cIf the first (paycheck) is wrong, it catches up on the next one.\u201d  Editing by Lauren Young and Lisa Shumaker"

          "body": "* Oil trades near strongest levels since mid-2015  * Retailers up after bullish note  * Indexes up: Dow 0.4 pct, S&P 0.8 pct, Nasdaq 1.5 pct (Updates to close)  By Caroline Valetkevitch  NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday in the first session of the new year, pushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record closing highs, as investors were optimistic that 2018 will bring more gains for the market.  Gains were driven the most by technology, but consumer discretionary, healthcare, energy and materials sectors were also up more than 1 percent each.  Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft pulled the technology index up 1.4 percent, following a 37-percent surge in 2017 that made it the best-performing S&P sector.  Major stock indexes had closed out 2017 with their best performances since 2013. Many investors say the rally could continue this year with help from the recently approved U.S. tax overhaul that is anticipated to boost profits as well as the economy.  \u201cWe\u2019re off to the races once again,\u201d said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect the kind of moves we saw last year. But as long as monetary policy stays the way it is ... my view is stocks are going to have a decent year. And fiscal policy has become stimulative, as well, given the tax bill.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104.79 points, or 0.42 percent, to 24,824.01, the S&P 500 gained 22.18 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,695.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 103.51 points, or 1.5 percent, to 7,006.90.  \u201cOur best guess is the first quarter or half of the year can be OK as a continuation of last year,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  But, he said, there are risks ahead. \u201cValuations are still stretched, interest rates are still rising, and those will provide headwinds to the market at some point.\u201d  The S&P consumer discretionary index was up 1.5 percent, helped by a gain in Amazon.com of 1.7 percent.  J.C. Penney, Nordstrom and Kohl\u2019s climbed after a bullish Citigroup note on the retail sector detailed benefits from the corporate tax cuts.  Energy shares were up even though oil prices dipped. Oil hovered near mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in major exporter Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia. The S&P energy index rose 1.8 percent.  Shares of casino operators Wynn Resorts and Melco Resorts & Entertainment were down after a report showed lower-than-expected rise in Macau gambling revenue in December.  Abbott Labs jumped 3 percent and hit an intraday record of $59.20 after two brokerages upgraded the company\u2019s stock to \u201coverweight.\u201d  Shares of Allstate were down 2.7 percent on a brokerage downgrade.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urged the nation\u2019s railroads and transit agencies to take all possible measures to meet deadlines to install a safety system called positive train control (PTC) to prevent crashes.  Letters dated Dec. 27, which were made public on Tuesday, said Chao wanted railroads to \u201cgreatly accelerate\u201d efforts to meet congressional deadlines. A deadly Amtrak crash last month near Seattle that killed three occurred on a section of track that did not have the PTC system operating.  The system is designed to prevent derailments caused by excessive speed. Investigators have said several deadly U.S. train crashes in recent years could have been prevented if the system was in place.  In 2008, Congress mandated the implementation of PTC nationwide by the end of 2015, then extended that deadline until the end of 2018 when its installation became more complex than anticipated. The government can extend the deadline to 2020 to complete some aspects of the system.  The National Transportation Safety Board said last month the Amtrak train that derailed onto a highway near Seattle was going 78 miles per hour (125.5 km per hour) in a 30-mph zone.   The letters went to the chief executives of railroads, including Amtrak, BNSF Railway Co, Canadian National Railway (CNR.TO), CSX Corp (CSX.O), Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N), Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) and transit systems in Chicago, Boston, New York, Boston, Newark, Seattle and Los Angeles.  Amtrak said last month it was \u201cimperative that the rail industry urgently work together to get PTC activated on the national network as soon as possible - and certainly by the December 2018 federal deadline, if not before.\u201d  The Transportation Department said 12 of 41 railroads covered by the requirements report having installed less than 50 percent of the hardware required for their PTC systems as of Sept. 30. The government said the systems are in operation on 45 percent of route miles owned by freight railroads and just 24 percent of passenger railroads  Chao\u2019s letter said the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) leadership plans to work with railroads \u201cto help create an increased level of urgency to underscore the imperative of meeting existing timeline expectations for rolling out this critical rail-safety technology.\u201d  The Association of American Railroads said on Tuesday that railroads are making progress on installing and testing PTC technology and freight railroads are on track to meet the deadlines established by Congress.   Separately, the Transportation Department wrote to U.S. senators on Tuesday asking them to approve the nomination of Ronald Batory to head the FRA. Batory, a former Conrail president, was approved unanimously by a committee but has been held up due to a dispute over a New York area infrastructure project.

The Pennsylvania congressman proposed legislation that would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. In April, a United Airlines  passenger was forcibly removed from his seat, prompting public outrage. The airline banned the practice.

          "title": "What has brought Iranian protesters to the streets?",
          "body": " LONDON (Reuters) - Iran warned of a tough crackdown on Sunday against demonstrators posing one of the boldest challenges to its clerical leaders since nationwide unrest shook the Islamist theocracy in 2009.  How serious are the protests?  Political protests are rare in Iran, where security services are pervasive. And yet tens of thousands of people have protested across the country since Thursday. The demonstrations are the biggest since unrest in 2009 that followed the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  They began in Iran\u2019s second city of Mashhad in the northeast on Thursday and spread to Tehran and other urban centers. Iranians vented their anger over a sharp increase in prices of basic items like eggs, and a government proposal to increase fuel prices in next year\u2019s budget.  Some protesters also vented their rage over high unemployment and savings that were lost after investments in unlicensed credit and financial institutions turned sour.  The demonstrations, initially focused on economic hardships and alleged corruption, turned into political rallies. Anger was soon directed at the clerical leadership in power since the 1979 revolution, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate authority in Iran\u2019s cumbersome system of dual clerical and republican rule.  How will the government respond?  The government\u2019s main challenge is to find a way to suppress the uprising without provoking more anger.  So far, while the authorities have threatened to take strong measures, in practice they have largely been restrained. Although two protesters were killed and hundreds arrested, many believe the police have shown some self-control throughout most of the demonstrations.  Iran\u2019s National Security Council held urgent meetings and so far has decided to block social media and messaging apps to restrict the flow of information and calls for demonstrations.  The state has a powerful security apparatus it can call upon. But so far it has refrained from despatching the elite Revolutionary Guards, the Basij militia, and plain-clothed security forces who crushed the 2009 uprising and killed dozens of protesters.  In the meantime, the government backed down on plans to raise fuel prices and promised to increase cash handouts to the poor and create more jobs in coming years.  What are the main demands of protesters?  Iranians across the country want higher wages and an end to alleged graft. Many also question the wisdom of Iran\u2019s foreign policy in the Middle East, where it has intervened in Syria and Iraq in a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia.  The country\u2019s financial support for Palestinians and the Lebanese Shi\u2019ite group Hezbollah also angered Iranians, who want their government to focus on domestic economic problems instead.  The wide spectrum of slogans showed that the wave of demonstrations cover a range of social classes who have different demands.  Unlike the unrest in 2009, the latest protests appear to be more spontaneous without a clear leader. This may be a more dangerous scenario for authorities, because it means they cannot round up the figureheads, a solution that was employed in 2009.  Some demonstrators even shouted \u201cReza Shah, bless your soul\u201d, a reference to the king who ruled Iran from 1925 to 1941, and his Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic\u2019s first leader.  Has Iran had similar uprisings?  In the last decade, Iran has experienced small-scale demonstrations against economic hardship or local environmental crises, and one nationwide political uprising in 2009 against alleged election fraud.  But a widespread uprising against major political and economic issues would be worrying for the Islamic Republic and far more difficult to contain.  Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader managed to control the 2009 uprising, which coincided with Arab revolts in the region, after putting the opposition leaders under house arrest, but the new wave of demonstrations in Iran does not seem orchestrated.  That could make it more of a threat than past unrest in a country that often portrays the 1979 revolution as a revolt by the poor against exploitation and oppression. Calls for an end to economic hardship are especially sensitive for that reason.  Is the economic situation worse than before?  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani championed a nuclear deal with world powers in 2015 to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions.  However, Iranians have yet to see any benefits.  Unemployment stood at 12.4 percent in this fiscal year, according to the Statistical Center of Iran, up 1.4 points from the previous year. Youth unemployment reached 28.8 percent this year.  Economic indexes have improved under Rouhani\u2019s government and the economy is no longer in dire straits.  Inflation dropped single digits for the first time after about a quarter century in June 2016. Gross domestic product growth soared to 12.5 percent in the year through last March 20, although almost entirely due to a leap in oil exports.  However, growth has been too slow for an overwhelmingly youthful population, far more interested in jobs and change than in the Islamist idealism and anti-Shah republicanism of the 1979 revolution that the old guard clings to.  Iran\u2019s recovery has been slowed by tensions with the United States. President Donald Trump has raised the possibility that sanctions could be reimposed or new ones introduced.  How has the West reacted?  Trump, who has detailed a more aggressive approach to Tehran over its nuclear program, tweeted that Iranians \u201care finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism,\u201d and \u201cwill not take it any longer.\u201d  Canada said it was encouraged by the demonstrations. British foreign minister Boris Johnson said on his Twitter page that it was \u201cvital that citizens should have the right to demonstrate peacefully.\u201d  Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Michael Georgy"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iran\u2019s supreme leader accused the country\u2019s enemies on Tuesday of being behind days of street unrest, as the death toll from anti-government demonstrations rose to 21.  Riot police were out in force in several cities on the sixth day of protests, which spread to the northwestern city of Tabriz, according to social media posts, as security forces scrambled to contain the boldest challenge to Iran\u2019s leadership since 2009.  More than 450 protesters have been arrested in the capital in the last three days, Tehran\u2019s deputy provincial governor said, and hundreds of others were detained around the country. A judicial official said some could face the death penalty.  In the southwestern city of Ahvaz, police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators.  \u201cPolice shot tear gas and later went around asking shops on two main streets to close, to completely clear the area,\u201d a resident told Reuters by telephone.  Nine people were killed in Isfahan province during protests on Monday night, including two members of the security forces, state TV said. Six protesters were killed during an attack on a police station in the town of Qahderijan in that province. The local governor said the protesters were armed.    Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Iran\u2019s foes of fomenting the unrest, which began as protests about economic hardship and corruption but have grown into political rallies, some of which have criticized him by name.  \u201cIn recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic,\u201d he said, in his first reaction to the unrest.   He did not name the enemies but Ali\u00a0Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia were behind the riots.   \u201cSaudis will receive Iran\u2019s unexpected response and they know how serious it can be,\u201d Shamkhani was quoted by Tasnim news as saying in an interview with Beirut-based\u00a0Al Mayadeen TV.      Khamenei said on his website that he would address the nation about the events \u201cwhen the time is right\u201d.  The United States rejected the suggestion that the protests were the work of foreign powers.  \u201cWe all know that\u2019s complete nonsense,\u201d said Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.   \u201cThe demonstrations are completely spontaneous. They are virtually in every city in Iran. This is the precise picture of a long oppressed people rising up against their dictators.\u201d   Washington will seek emergency sessions at the United Nations to express support for the protesters, Haley said, adding that the international community had failed to support reformist protests in 2009 that were crushed by Tehran.  \u201cWe must not make that mistake again,\u201d she said.  The U.S. State Department urged Tehran to restore access to any social media sites that had been restricted and urged Iranian security forces to exercise restraint.  A U.S. official told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that U.S. intelligence officials think the protests have little chance of toppling the government.  Responding to President Donald Trump\u2019s daily tweets praising the protesters, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iranians enjoyed the right to peaceful protest that was denied to citizens of U.S. allies in the Middle East.  \u201cThese hard-earned rights will be protected, and infiltrators will not be allowed to sabotage them through violence and destruction,\u201d Zarif tweeted.  French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said a planned trip by Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to Tehran this week had been postponed. Macron also told Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a telephone call that Tehran must respect Iranians\u2019 right to free speech and to protest.  Russia, which is allied with Iran in its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said \u201cunacceptable\u201d external interference was destabilizing the situation in Iran, the RIA news agency reported.   Turkey, which, along with the United States and Saudi Arabia, supports Syrian rebel groups, called for restraint.  \u201cWe believe it is necessary to avoid violence and not succumb to provocations,\u201d the Turkish Foreign Ministry said, adding that it hoped foreign intervention would be avoided.      Earlier on Tuesday, Trump had tweeted: \u201cThe people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime ... The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!\u201d  The head of Tehran\u2019s Revolutionary Court, Musa Ghazanfarabadi, said protesters would be tried soon and the ringleaders could be charged with \u201cmoharebeh\u201d \u2014 an Islamic term meaning warring against God \u2014 which carries the death penalty.   Deputy Interior Minister Hossein Zolfaghari said 90 percent of the detainees were under 25, showing the younger generation\u2019s frustration at economic hardships and lack of social freedoms.  Iran is an OPEC oil producer and regional power deeply involved in Syria and Iraq as part of a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia, foreign interventions resented by many Iranians who want their leaders to pour more resources into cutting youth unemployment, which reached 29 percent last year.  President Rouhani, seen as a pragmatist who is at odds with hardliners, deflected criticisms of his economic record.  \u201cPeople on the streets do not ask for bread and water, but for more freedom,\u201d he said in televised comments on Monday, implying that the protesters were not targeting his government but the more rigid clerical establishment.        Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said both protesters and the security forces should follow the law.  \u201cEven those who are confronting the rioters should act within the framework of law,\u201d he told a news conference.  State television reported that protesters who set ablaze four mosques in villages in Savadkuh County in northern Iran on Monday had been arrested.

          "title": "Fitch Affirms PartnerRe; Outlook Stable",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed PartnerRe Ltd.'s (PRE) ratings, including its 'A-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and the 'A+' (Strong) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating of Partner Reinsurance Company Ltd. The Rating Outlook is Stable. See the full list of rating actions at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the company's strong reinsurance business profile, strong long-term financial performance, very strong capitalization with reasonable financial leverage and very strong reserve position. These favorable factors are partially offset by PRE's limited diversity outside of reinsurance and Fitch's negative sector outlook on global reinsurance. Fitch considers PRE to have a strong reinsurance business profile, writing a diverse mix of reinsurance lines. While PRE is significantly larger than many of its more specialized reinsurance peers, its overall market position trails several of its larger, higher-rated, more diversified (re)insurance peers. Fitch views PRE's minimal presence in primary lines as a disadvantage relative to companies that have a more balanced platform of both reinsurance and insurance business. PRE posted net income of $145 million for the first nine months of 2017 (9M17), which was reduced from $578 million in 9M16 due to $472 million of pre-tax net catastrophe losses from several large events. The company's non-life operations produced a 9M17 GAAP combined ratio of 98.8%, which included 17.5 points of natural catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and 14.2 points of favorable prior-year reserve development. PRE has historically produced strong profitability, although with overall higher volatility than peers. PRE's most recent five-year average (2012-2016) combined ratio and return on average common equity are 87.7% and 10.5%, respectively. Fitch views PRE's capitalization as very strong with a conservative net premiums written (NPW) to equity ratio of 0.7x and an 'Extremely Strong' score on Fitch's Prism factor-based capital model.  PRE's financial leverage ratio is moderate at 20.2% as of Sept. 30, 2017, up slightly from 19.7% at year-end 2016. Total shareholders' equity increased 2% during 9M17, despite $437 million of after-tax net catastrophe losses in 3Q17. PRE's loss reserves have exhibited consistently favorable development. In the most recent five-year period, from 2012 to 2016, the company produced prior-year reserve releases totaling $3.5 billion, or 17.4% of net premiums earned, averaging 7.1% and 10.3% of beginning of year reserves and shareholders' equity, respectively. Fitch believes this trend indicates management has taken a conservative approach to setting loss reserves. As reserve releases have been a significant contributor to PRE's earnings, Fitch recognizes the company's run-rate profitability could decline if reserve redundancies diminish. PRE's ratings also reflect Fitch's negative sector outlook for global reinsurance, which has faced declining premium prices and weakening of terms and conditions, thus limiting organic growth opportunities. Although the reinsurance market environment is expected to improve as a result of the significant 3Q17 catastrophe losses, uncertainty remains as to the extent and duration of such improvement. Fitch does not rate PRE's parent company, EXOR N.V., but views EXOR's credit quality as neutral to PRE's ratings. Fitch expects EXOR to maintain a conservative dividend policy from PRE, preferring to accumulate capital for business opportunities. EXOR made a commitment to limit common share dividends from PRE to 67% of quarterly net income until year-end 2020. PRE continues to manage its operations generally independent of EXOR, although EXOR is expected to offer reasonable support to PRE as needed. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating sensitivities that could result in an upgrade include improvement to a very strong business profile as a result of an enhanced relative competitive market position; demonstrating favorable run-rate earnings and low volatility, with a combined ratio in the low 90s; growth in risk-adjusted capital while maintaining a NPW-to-equity ratio of 0.8x or lower; a financial leverage ratio at or below 20%; and fixed-charge coverage of at least 8x. Key rating sensitivities that could result in a downgrade include sustained reported combined ratios above 100%, operating ratios above 90% or net income return on equity below 7%; fixed-charge coverage below 6x; consistent adverse loss reserve development; a NPW-to-equity ratio increase to more than 1.0x; a PRE financial leverage ratio above 25%; or deterioration in EXOR's credit profile. In addition, deterioration in reinsurance sector fundamentals or consolidation in the reinsurance landscape that Fitch views as weakening PRE's competitive position, business profile or overall profitability could lead to a downgrade.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City will install more than 1,500 new barrier posts on sidewalks and plazas to protect pedestrians from vehicles after at least two instances last year of drivers killing people after mounting the curb, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday.  The thin, cylindrical, waist-height metal bollards are intended to be a more attractive alternative to the hulking concrete blocks the New York Police Department had deposited in busier areas around the city following the vehicle attacks, de Blasio said.  \u201cWe understand what\u2019s happening around the world and we even saw some tragedies here,\u201d the mayor said at a Times Square announcement in front of a line of the posts. Similar bollards were installed in Times Square in 2016.  There has been a spate of attacks on pedestrians in European and U.S. cities by people using cars or trucks, a tactic that the Islamic State militant group encourages its supporters to use. In July 2016, a driver used a truck to kill 86 people celebrating Bastille Day in Nice. Similar carnage unfolded at a Christmas market in Berlin a few months later.  De Blasio spoke within sight of the place where an intoxicated man in May steered a car along sidewalks for three city blocks, killing a young woman and injuring at least 22 people.  Last November, a man was charged with murder and providing support to Islamic State after he plowed down people on a Manhattan bike lane the previous month, killing eight.  \u201cWe know we have to do even more to keep people safe,\u201d de Blasio said on Tuesday. The city will spend an additional $50 million on installing the new bollards in busy, high-profile areas and other efforts to protect public spaces, the mayor said.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dropped on Tuesday to its lowest in more than three months, weighed down on the first trading day of 2018 by expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture.  The dollar\u2019s decline extended its underperformance in 2017, which saw the greenback post its weakest annual performance in 14 years.  \u201cInvestors remain skeptical about the Fed\u2019s outlook for three additional interest rate increases this year, especially given the extremely benign inflation backdrop in the U.S.,\u201d said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst, at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.   The dollar\u2019s upside was also capped, as major central banks such as the Bank of England and European Central Bank are moving toward normalizing their own monetary policies.  The dollar index hit a 3-1/2-month trough of 91.751 and was last down 0.3 percent at 91.887 . For 2017, the dollar index slid more than 9.8 percent, its weakest since 2003.  \u201cAny further drop below 91.00 would confirm a continuation of the dollar\u2019s bearish trend from the beginning of 2017, with the next major downside target around the 90.00 psychological support level,\u201d said James Chen, head of research at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.  The euro, meanwhile, has been on a tear especially since the second half of last year on optimism over a brightening euro zone economic picture.  In 2017, the euro had its strongest yearly showing against the dollar since 2003 as European economies strengthened and expectations grew the ECB will wind down monetary stimulus.  The euro rose to start the new year, climbing to a nearly four-month high of $1.2082. It was last up 0.3 percent at $1.2049.  Euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high.

The ECB\u2019s Benoit Coeure said he saw a \u201creasonable chance\u201d the bank\u2019s bond purchases would not be extended beyond September.  Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.4 percent to 112.32. The yen continues to benefit from last week\u2019s release of the Bank of Japan\u2019s minutes of its meeting.   The minutes showed some members are considering tightening monetary policy if the economy continues to improve next year, which would be a significant shift in strategy for a central bank thought to be the last to exit easier monetary policies.

Gains were driven the most by technology, though consumer discretionary, healthcare, energy and materials sectors were also up more than 1 percent each.  Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft pulled the technology index higher, following a 37-percent surge in 2017 that made it the best performing S&P sector.  Major stock indexes closed out 2017 with their best performances since 2013. Many investors say the rally could continue this year with the help of a U.S. tax overhaul that is anticipated to boost profits as well as the economy.  \u201cWhen you look at the sentiment indicators ... We\u2019re starting to see sentiment really pick up. Our best guess is the first quarter or half of the year can be OK as a continuation of last year,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  But, he said, there are risks ahead. \u201cValuations are still stretched, interest rates are still rising, and those will provide headwinds to the market at some point.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.04 points, or 0.25 percent, to 24,780.26, the S&P 500 gained 17.53 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,691.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 92.43 points, or 1.34 percent, to 6,995.82.  The S&P consumer discretionary index was up 1.5 percent, helped by a gain in Amazon.com.  J.C. Penney, Nordstrom and Kohl\u2019s climbed after a bullish Citigroup note on the retail sector detailed benefits from the corporate tax cuts.  Energy shares were up even though oil prices dipped. Oil hovered near mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in major exporter Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.88-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices hit mid-2015 highs in early trading on Tuesday but dipped to settle slightly lower as major pipelines in Libya and the UK restarted and U.S production soared to the highest level in more than four decades.   It was the first time since January 2014 that the two crude oil benchmarks opened a year above $60 per barrel. Prices were buoyed by large anti-government rallies in Iran and supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled 5 cents lower at $60.37 a barrel. In early trading WTI hit $60.74, the highest level since June 2015.  Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark, settled 30 cents, or 0.5 percent lower at $66.57 a barrel. The session high of $67.29 was the highest since May 2015.      The spread between U.S. crude and Brent WTCLc1-LCoc1 hit the narrowest in nearly two weeks.   The 450,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity Forties pipeline system in the North Sea returned to full operations on Dec. 30 after an unplanned shutdown.  Repairs have been completed on a Libyan oil pipeline damaged in a suspected attack last week and production is restarting gradually, engineers said.  \u201cThe resolution of the North Sea pipeline issue is having the expected result that the Brent-WTI spread is narrowing today,\u201d David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington.  Thompson added that traders have been returning to work from the holidays, boosting volumes.  \u201cDespite the day\u2019s price weakness, both Brent and WTI remain in solid, long-term bullish trends - $58.95 is nearby support on WTI front-month futures and $65.60 is the corresponding support on front-month Brent futures.\u201d  Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader on Tuesday accused the country\u2019s enemies of stirring unrest, as the death toll rose to 21 from anti-government demonstrations that began last week.[nL8N1OX0XY]   Iran is OPEC\u2019s third-largest crude producer. Iranian oil industry and shipping sources said protests have had no impact so far on oil production or exports.  \u201cGeopolitical risks are clearly back on the crude oil agenda after having been absent almost entirely since the oil market ran into a surplus in the second half of 2014,\u201d Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, said, also citing Kurdistan and Libya.  Oil prices have been supported by production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The cuts are scheduled to cover all of 2018.  U.S. commercial crude oil inventories have fallen by almost 20 percent from their historic highs last March, to 431.9 million barrels.  Strong demand growth, especially from China, has also been supporting crude.  However, rising U.S. production, which is on the verge of breaking through 10 million bpd, has tempered the bullish outlook.  \u201cWe think U.S. tight oil production growth warrants close monitoring as it could spoil OPEC\u2019s market-balancing efforts, pushing the market into surplus in 2018,\u201d Barclays bank said.  October U.S crude production rose 167,000 barrels per day to 9.64 million bpd, according to the EIA\u2019s monthly production report. If the figure is not revised next month, it would be the highest monthly level since May 1971.  Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore; editing by David Gregorio and Susan Thomas"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dropped on Tuesday to its lowest in more than three months, weighed down on the first trading day of 2018 by expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture.  The dollar\u2019s decline extended its underperformance in 2017, which saw the greenback post its weakest annual performance in 14 years.  \u201cInvestors remain skeptical about the Fed\u2019s outlook for three additional interest rate increases this year, especially given the extremely benign inflation backdrop in the U.S.,\u201d said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst, at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.   The dollar\u2019s upside was also capped, as major central banks such as the Bank of England and European Central Bank are moving toward normalizing their own monetary policies.  The dollar index hit a 3-1/2-month trough of 91.751 and was last down 0.3 percent at 91.887 . For 2017, the dollar index slid more than 9.8 percent, its weakest since 2003.  \u201cAny further drop below 91.00 would confirm a continuation of the dollar\u2019s bearish trend from the beginning of 2017, with the next major downside target around the 90.00 psychological support level,\u201d said James Chen, head of research at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.  The euro, meanwhile, has been on a tear especially since the second half of last year on optimism over a brightening euro zone economic picture.  In 2017, the euro had its strongest yearly showing against the dollar since 2003 as European economies strengthened and expectations grew the ECB will wind down monetary stimulus.  The euro rose to start the new year, climbing to a nearly four-month high of $1.2082. It was last up 0.3 percent at $1.2049.  Euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high.  Also boosting the euro was a comment from an ECB official over the weekend. The ECB\u2019s Benoit Coeure said he saw a \u201creasonable chance\u201d the bank\u2019s bond purchases would not be extended beyond September.  Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.4 percent to 112.32. The yen continues to benefit from last week\u2019s release of the Bank of Japan\u2019s minutes of its meeting.   The minutes showed some members are considering tightening monetary policy if the economy continues to improve next year, which would be a significant shift in strategy for a central bank thought to be the last to exit easier monetary policies.

          "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A group representing airline passengers has taken legal action to shift insolvency proceedings for budget airline Niki to Austria from Germany, in a move that could endanger the sale of the Air Berlin (AB1.DE) unit to Britain\u2019s IAG (ICAG.L).  Fairplane, seeking to recover more than 1 million euros ($1.2 million) it says Niki owes to passengers, filed separate legal cases on Tuesday to block insolvency proceedings in Berlin and to open them instead in Austria.  Although the sum sought is relatively small, a spokesman for Air Berlin liquidator Lucas Floether said the complaint could derail the sale of Niki to IAG\u2019s low-cost Vueling operation that was agreed last week.  \u201cIf the complaint before the Charlottenburg Court (in Berlin) succeeds, the sale of Niki to IAG would be greatly endangered,\u201d the spokesman said. A ruling by the court on the case was due this week.  British Airways\u2019 owner IAG said last Friday it would buy Niki for 20 million euros ($24 million) and provide up to 16.5 million euros in additional liquidity to the company.  The sale to IAG, which had been in exclusive talks to acquire the airline, appeared to mark the final chapter in the demise of Air Berlin, the former No.2 German air carrier that earlier owned Niki.  Fairplane argues however that Niki, which is registered in as a company in Austria, had been profitable but had lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December, grounding planes and stranding passengers.  Spokesman Ronald Schmid said that dragging Niki into the German insolvency process was wrong, and that passengers stood a better chance of getting their money back in the Austrian courts.  \u201cWe want to ensure that the insolvency is carried out in Austria - where it belongs - so that there are no conflicts of interest,\u201d Schmid told Reuters.  IAG declined to comment.  In appointing Floether to liquidate Air Berlin in December, a German insolvency judge was of the opinion that, although Niki was registered as a company in Austria, its center of main interest was in fact in Germany.

          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - Among U.S. patients hospitalized for the common heart rhythm disorder known as atrial fibrillation, those in rural areas may be more likely to die than their urban counterparts, a new study suggests.   Researchers examined data on 248,731 adults nationwide who were hospitalized for atrial fibrillation between 2012 and 2014. After accounting for patient characteristics and medical issues that can influence survival odds, rural patients were 17 percent more likely to die in the hospital, the study found.   \u201cPresumably, a higher risk of death in patients from rural regions was related to differences in practice patterns and access to specialists,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Wesley O\u2019Neal of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia.  Atrial fibrillation is often managed with medication. For more troublesome cases, common treatments include ablation, a minimally invasive surgery to destroy heart tissue that\u2019s causing abnormal heart rhythms, and cardioversion, a procedure to shock the heart into a normal rhythm.   Both of these procedures were more likely to be done at urban hospitals, the study found.  \u201cAlthough we cannot equate a specific number or percentage of the observed mortality risk to differences in practice patterns or access to specialty care, our data do suggest that these differences exist,\u201d O\u2019Neal said by email.   In atrial fibrillation, electrical impulses in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic, causing part of the heart muscle to quiver rather than contracting normally. As a result, blood doesn\u2019t move as well to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This can lead to the formation of clots that can travel through the arteries. The risk of stroke is up to seven times higher in people with atrial fibrillation than in people without the disorder.  The analysis included almost 219,000 urban patients and nearly 30,000 urban patients from 44 states and the District of Columbia, representing more than 96 percent of the U.S. population.   Rural atrial fibrillation patients were more likely to die of all causes during their hospital stays, researchers report in Heart Rhythm.   This held true after accounting for several common medical conditions that can accompany atrial fibrillation including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart failure and kidney damage.   Overall, 8 percent of urban atrial fibrillation patients had cardioversion procedures, compared with just 4 percent of their urban counterparts, the study found.   At the same time, 9 percent of urban patients got ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation, compared with 1 percent of people in rural hospitals.   About 1.3 percent of atrial fibrillation patients died in rural hospitals, compared with 1 percent in urban facilities.   The study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how hospital locations might influence survival odds for patients admitted with atrial fibrillation.   Researchers also lacked data on the severity of medical conditions that might impact survival odds, the authors note.   The severity of problems like diabetes and high blood pressure can impact survival odds, as can access to care in the community, lifestyle factors and how well physicians follow guidelines for diagnosing and treating atrial fibrillation, Dr. Thomas Deering and Dr. Ashish Bhimani of the arrhythmia center at the Piedmont Heart Institute in Atlanta write in an accompanying editorial.   \u201cExisting information suggests that rural patients may have higher overall and cardiovascular mortality rates,\u201d Deering said by email. \u201cThere is also some limited data suggesting that several atrial fibrillation outcomes, for example appropriate anticoagulation usage and appropriate referral for advanced procedural options such as ablation, are lower in rural than urban settings.\u201d   SOURCE: bit.ly/2CbXQp1 Heart Rhythm, online December 10, 2017."

          "body": "(Reuters) - Power and natural gas prices in several U.S. regions jumped to their highest in years on Tuesday as gas use hit an all-time high due to arctic weather blanketing much of the country.  Gas demand in the lower 48 U.S. states is expected to reach an all-time high of 144.0 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Tuesday, according to Reuters data going back to 2008.  That would top the 142.0 bcfd record set on Monday, New Year\u2019s Day, and the previous record of 133.8 bcfd set on Jan. 7, 2017, data showed.  One bcfd represents enough gas to fuel about five million U.S. homes.  In New England, next-day electricity prices jumped to their highest since March 2014 as temperatures across the six-state region were expected to remain below freezing all week.  Temperatures in Boston, New England\u2019s biggest city, were expected to peak at 20 Fahrenheit (minus 11 Celsius) on Tuesday, and after a pair of slightly warmer days, slip further to 17F on Friday and 10F on Saturday, according to AccuWeather. On Monday, the high was 13F.  Last week, next-day gas prices in New England rose to their highest since the winter of 2015.  Gas and electricity prices in New England usually spike on the coldest winter days as homes and businesses use most of the region\u2019s gas supplies for heating, leaving little for utilities to burn in power plants.  To produce electricity during the freeze, New England\u2019s electric grid, ISO New England, expects utilities to increase their use of oil for power generation instead of gas.   With the retirement of several coal, oil and nuclear plants over the past decade, gas has become the biggest fuel for electric production in New England. Gas generated about 49 percent of the region\u2019s power in 2016, while oil accounted for just 1 percent.  Generators in New England usually only burn oil on the coldest winter days.  Elsewhere, next-day power prices in PJM, the power grid covering parts of 13 U.S. mid-Atlantic and Midwest states, rose to their highest since February 2015.  Last week, next-day gas in Chicago rose to the highest since March 2015, while New York hit its highest since December 2016.  Reporting by Scott DiSavino in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe"

GZE said the decision violated the terms of the agreement and the company may initiate arbitration to resolve the dispute, according to a letter from GZE to Curacao\u2019s government seen by Reuters.  Curacao and GZE signed a deal in 2016 to invest some $10 billion in upgrading the facility.  Curacao\u2019s government said GZE does not have the muscle to invest in the refinery and lacks \u201cunconditional support\u201d from the Chinese government.  \u201cGZE turned out to be the contrary of what it said at the time of signing the MoU (memorandum of understanding),\u201d Curacao said on its government website in a statement dated Sunday.  \u201cCuracao is looking for a viable alternative to guarantee the future of the refinery,\u201d it added.  GZE was not immediately available for comment. In its letter, the company refutes that it is unable to undertake the project.  \u201cGZE does not understand and is very disappointed for the referenced letter from the Curacao government and others. GZE and its partners have made and are making promising progress towards the project financing,\u201d the letter reads.  Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has for decades operated the refinery, which opened in 1918, under a lease agreement. But cash-poor PDVSA has been reluctant to invest some $1.5 billion that Curacao authorities requested several years ago to modernize the 335,000 barrel-per-day facility.

          "body": "* European stocks close lower  * U.S. stocks higher, boosting global shares  * Euro, sterling gain while dollar drops (Updates to European market close; adds commentary)  By Stephanie Kelly  NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - European stocks closed lower on Tuesday, the first trading day of 2018, while Wall Street advanced and the U.S. dollar fell to its weakest in over three months against key currencies.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.61 percent. The index had set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value in 2017.  Major stock indexes closed 2017 with their best performance since 2013. In the U.S. market, the advance came amid strong economic growth and corporate earnings, low interest rates and hopes, now realized, of U.S. corporate tax cuts.  U.S. equity indexes advanced on Tuesday, buoyed by gains in technology and consumer discretionary stocks.  Increases in Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft shares pulled the S&P 500 index higher on Tuesday.  \u201cPeople are back to looking at what have been the winners. It has been very momentum driven,\u201d said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 59.79 points, or 0.24 percent, to 24,779.01, the S&P 500 gained 17.15 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,690.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 91.91 points, or 1.33 percent, to 6,995.30.  In Europe, equities closed lower after autos stocks fell following weaker car registrations data. Trading was also cautious ahead of the launch of a major reform of European financial markets.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.21 percent along with euro zone stocks, down 0.19 percent.  Shares rose in Asia. Shanghai blue chips climbed 1.41 percent and MSCI\u2019s 24-country emerging market stock index jumped to a multi-year high after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline.  The dollar index, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.23 percent. It was hampered by market expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture.  The dollar had already hit a three-month low on Friday, bringing its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worst performance since 2003.  Other currencies gained. The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.2044 and hit a four-month high on Tuesday after data showed that euro zone manufacturers ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.  The Japanese yen strengthened 0.28 percent at 112.35 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3594, up 0.69 percent on the day.  U.S. Treasury yields rose in line with European government yields. A European Central Bank official said the bank\u2019s massive bond purchase program might not continue later this year.  A reversal of year-end buying has also driven U.S. Treasury yields higher, said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.  \u201cLots of institutions buy Treasuries to hold over year-end for liquidity. To see that reversal early in the year is not a surprise,\u201d Rehling said.  Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last fell 16/32 in price to yield 2.4687 percent, from 2.411 percent late on Friday.  The 30-year bond last fell 45/32 in price to yield 2.8105 percent, from 2.741 percent late on Friday.  U.S. crude fell 0.13 percent to $60.34 per barrel and Brent was at $66.52, down 0.52 percent. Oil prices earlier had enjoyed their strongest start to a year since 2014 amid large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.  Copper lost 0.42 percent to $7,216.50 a tonne, but that follows a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top.  Spot gold added 1.0 percent to $1,315.15 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - British reality television show \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d launched an all-female line-up on Tuesday involving politicians, a journalist and other performing artists to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.  The show, versions of which have appeared in a list of other countries, features contestants being locked in a house and given arduous tasks with the public voting to evict them.  Television station Channel 5 said 12 women would join the start of the show including journalist Rachel Johnson, sister of Britain\u2019s foreign minister Boris Johnson. Names of the other contestants were not being released until the show aired.  The station said the series with an all-female cast was \u201ca salute to a centenary of women\u2019s suffrage\u201d but some male celebrities would enter the house over the course of the series.  \u201cThe housemates will take part in a series of entertaining tasks and hidden experiments which will test their - and our - assumptions, challenge gender stereotypes and reveal fascinating truths about what it is to be a woman - and man - in the 21st century,\u201d Channel 5 said in a statement.  The show comes at the start of a year when Britain will host a range of events to mark 100 years since women got the vote after years of battling for equal rights.  Millicent Fawcett, who formed the National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies in 1897 and spent decades advocating for equal rights including voting rights, is to become the first woman with a statue in London\u2019s Parliament Square.  Fawcett led a peaceful campaign for equal rights including petitions, lobbying members of parliament and non-violent protests. The movement gave rise to more radical suffragettes, whose tactics included hunger strikes, arson and bomb attacks.  Britain granted women aged over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote in 1918, but it wasn\u2019t until 1928 that all women had the same voting rights as men.  The Royal Mint will launch a 50 pence coin to commemorate the anniversary, the Houses of Parliament will host a gamut of events with the hashtag #vote100, while nearby Westminster Hall will put on a public exhibition \u201cVoice and Vote\u201d.

No further details were provided, but critics of President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s leftist government seized on the incident, calling it a stark example of the oil-rich country\u2019s meltdown.  Local media reported that Colopoy\u2019s husband and a witness said the soldiers were drunk when they arrived at the queue for pork in a poor area of Caracas. They said the soldiers ordered the Venezuelans to move on because the traditional Christmas meat had run out, but the group refused.      \u201cThe National Guard went crazy and started firing,\u201d Colopoy\u2019s spouse Bernab\u00e9 said in a filmed interview circulating on social media. \u201cShe fell to the ground,\u201d he said, adding his wife was five month pregnant.

The Central American country, which has been engulfed in a political crisis since a disputed Nov. 26 presidential election, had a 2016 murder rate of 59.1 killings per 100,000 people.  \u201cWe\u2019ve registered a dramatic fall in the murder rate in this country due to the coordinated attack between the national police and military forces on drug smugglers and gangs,\u201d police investigations chief Romel Martinez said at a press conference.   Honduras\u2019 murder rate has been falling steadily in recent years, after hitting 85.5 murders per 100,000 people in 2011.

In recent weeks, the small coffee-exporting country has been convulsed by protests in which at least 31 people have died. The opposition says the election was stolen by President Juan Orlando Hernandez, a U.S. ally on tackling migration and drugs.

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Genossenschaftliche FinanzGruppe - Rating Action Report - Amended here FRANKFURT/LONDON, January 02 (Fitch) This is a reissue of the commentary published on 13 December 2017 to update selected bonds in the Dodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Form (RIDF). Content in the Rating Action Commentary remains unchanged and unaffected. Fitch Ratings has affirmed Genossenschaftliche FinanzGruppe's (GFG) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA-' with a Stable Outlook and Viability Rating (VR) at 'aa-'. Fitch has also affirmed the Long-Term IDRs of GFG's central institution, DZ BANK AG Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank, and of the 940 other bank members of GFG's mutual support scheme at 'AA-'/Stable. GFG is not a legal entity but a cooperative bank network whose cohesion is ensured by a mutual support scheme. Its IDRs apply to its individual member banks, in line with Fitch's criteria for rating banking structures backed by mutual support schemes. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. A full list of rated GFG members is available at www.fitchratings.com or via the link above. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT RATINGS The IDRs and senior debt ratings of GFG are driven by its VR, which is heavily influenced by the group's strong capitalisation. The ratings are group ratings based on the high cohesiveness of GFG underpinned by its tested mutual support mechanism and recognised deposit protection scheme with its own dedicated fund. In 2015, GFG set up a new deposit protection scheme to fulfil statutory requirements. This was in addition to its existing mutual support fund, which is a key component of a less regulated, voluntary scheme to protect members' viability. Both funds are managed by the National Association of German Cooperative Banks (BVR), which also oversees GFG's risk monitoring. We view GFG's mutual support mechanism as very strong in light of the group's extensive record and the group members' deep institutional integration. The support mechanism has been sufficient to protect the viability of even GFG's largest members and avert losses by their creditors. The ratings also reflect GFG's strong franchise in domestic retail and small business banking, strong funding profile, sound and improving asset quality, and solid but eroding profits. The ratings further factor in GFG's increasing cohesion, notably demonstrated by DZ BANK's position as the group's sole central institution since the bank's merger with WGZ BANK AG Westdeutsche Genossenschafts-Zentralbank AG in 3Q16. DZ BANK, as centralised supplier of the main banking products, together with GFG's single IT provider, Fiducia & GAD, further support GFG's capacity to react swiftly to external shocks. The merger was a major step in GFG's ongoing consolidation process, which also included about 40 mergers of local \"primary\" banks by 9M17 and will continue in 2018 with the merger of DZ BANK's commercial real estate (CRE) and public-sector lenders DG HYP Deutsche Genossenschafts-Hypothekenbank and WL BANK Westfaelische Landschaft Bodenkreditbank. However, we expect GFG to remain strongly committed to its decentralised structure, wide-ranging autonomy of local management and large (but gradually consolidating) branch network, as long as the onerous regulatory consequences thereof are outweighed by the benefits from the strong local franchise. We believe rising regulatory demands regarding the robustness and frequency of group-wide reporting will strengthen GFG's capacity to react swiftly to external shocks. After several strong years, GFG's profitability has weakened since 2016 as low interest rates increase pressure on interest margins arising from structurally strong competition in German banking. This pressure is only partially and gradually mitigated by GFG's pricing power, efficiency gains from IT consolidation and investments in digitisation as well as operating and regulatory cost relief from the primary banks' mergers. We expect profitability to weaken moderately in 2017 and 2018 but to remain sufficiently sound and diversified to absorb a further material erosion of net interest income without jeopardising the group's financial flexibility. GFG's capitalisation and internal capital generation, which benefit from low profit distribution, remain strong lines of defence as evidenced by a leverage ratio of 6.3% at end-2016. However, pressure on earnings is rising as interest rates are unlikely to rise materially in the short term. The IDRs of DZ BANK and its subsidiaries are group ratings and as such, the key rating drivers of these banks' IDRs, senior debt and market-linked securities' ratings are identical to those of GFG's. GFG's above-average growth in residential mortgage lending is unlikely to significantly weaken the group's risk profile, in our view, as the strong competition in German retail banking translates into margin erosion rather than loosened underwriting standards. DZ BANK's risk profile benefits from the bank's large, diversified and fairly low-risk retail activities, with leading market positions in savings and loans (Bausparkasse), insurance and asset management. Years of non-core asset restructuring, run-off, disposals and repayments have significantly reduced DZ BANK's exposure to more vulnerable asset classes such as ABS and the southern European public-sector and should reduce GFG's future earnings volatility. DZ BANK has material loan exposures to higher-risk asset classes including CRE, shipping and offshore portfolios. The CRE assets are concentrated on the German market and are performing satisfactorily. However, DVB BANK's shipping and offshore loans have deteriorated rapidly since 2016 and remain vulnerable to further material losses in the short term as the global shipping and offshore markets remain weak and offer little visibility. Despite a series of measures implemented and further options envisaged by DZ BANK to address DVB BANK's problems, these could continue to dent DZ BANK's otherwise robust profits, as seen in 1H17, but should remain manageable at both DZ BANK's and GFG's level. DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY (DCR) AND DEPOSIT RATINGS The Deposit Ratings of the 939 rated members and DZ BANK's DCR are aligned with GFG's IDRs. We do not assign Deposit Ratings to GFG as it is not a legal entity. In our view, GFG's consolidated layer of junior and vanilla senior debt does not sufficiently protect the group's preferred creditors such as depositors and derivative counterparties in a resolution scenario to merit a rating uplift or to give sufficient comfort that recoveries on deposits in a default scenario would be above average. In our view, resolution could only occur if its mutual support scheme fails to protect its members' viability. GFG's consolidated junior and vanilla senior debt buffer is limited by DZ BANK, which is GFG's predominant senior debt issuer, placing a large share of its senior debt issuance within GFG. In addition, the modest size of DZ BANK's wholesale business relative to the predominantly retail deposit-funded GFG limits DZ Bank's debt issuance needs. SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF) GFG's SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that extraordinary sovereign support for EU banks is possible but cannot be relied upon due to the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (which includes a bail-in tool) and the Single Resolution Mechanism's resolution tools and mechanisms. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated Tier 2 debt and hybrid capital issued by DZ BANK and its subsidiaries are notched off GFG's VR. The use of GFG's VR as the anchor rating is based on our view that GFG will ensure the issuers are able to meet their payments on these instruments. The ratings of DZ BANK's, DG HYP's and DVB's Tier 2 subordinated debt are notched once below GFG's VR to reflect their higher loss severity. The hybrid capital notes issued by DZ Bank Capital Funding Trust I are rated four notches below GFG's VR, two notches each for loss severity and for incremental non-performance risk as, in our view, this instrument's distribution trigger is less likely to be activated than those of the other rated hybrids. The other hybrid notes (see list below) are rated five notches below GFG's VR, twice for loss severity and three times for incremental non-performance risk. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT The gradual earnings erosion driven by the prevailing low interest rates is a growing constraint on GFG's financial flexibility. This pressure, in combination with sustained above-average loan growth, could result in the continuously weakening of the group's capital ratios and therefore eventually trigger a downgrade. A sudden interest rate increase could also weigh on earnings as the primary banks' large overnight deposit bases would reprice much more rapidly than their generally long-term, fixed-rate assets. However, this would not necessarily trigger a downgrade as the initial earnings pressure would eventually give way to rising asset margins. We would also consider downgrading the ratings if we believe GFG can no longer maintain its adequate internal capital generation by improving its cost efficiency while maintaining its decentralised structure. GFG's predominantly domestic loan book makes its performance sensitive to a weakening of Germany's economy. The solid economic outlook creates low downside rating pressure in the short term. However, a sharp rise in interest rates could trigger a severe deterioration of borrowers' credit quality, especially in more vulnerable small business clients. The ratings are also sensitive to material adverse regulatory or strategic changes weakening the group's cohesiveness, neither of which we expect in the short term. An upgrade is unlikely in the short term as it would primarily require a change in our assessment of GFG's cohesiveness and major efficiency gains from a (likely protracted) streamlining of the group's structure. DZ BANK's, DG HYP's, DVB's and the other member banks' IDRs, senior debt and market-linked securities' ratings are subject to the same sensitivities as GFG's IDRs. DCR AND DEPOSIT RATINGS The Deposit Ratings of GFG's members and DZ BANK's DCR are primarily sensitive to changes in GFG's IDRs. We could upgrade the Long-term Deposit Ratings and the DCR one notch above GFG's Long-Term IDR if the group's consolidated buffers of subordinated and senior vanilla debt increase substantially, which we deem unlikely in the foreseeable future. SR AND SRF An upgrade of GFG's SR and upward revision of its SRF would be contingent on a positive change in Fitch's view of the sovereign's propensity to support its systemically important banks. While not impossible, this is highly unlikely. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The subordinated debt and hybrid securities' ratings are notched from, and primarily sensitive to, a change in, GFG's VR. They are also sensitive to a change in their notching, which could be triggered by a reassessment of loss severity or relative non-performance risk.

          "title": "Race may matter in hospital care for preemies",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - Among the tiniest preemies, black and Hispanic infants are more likely than white babies to be born at hospitals with worse death and complication rates, a study in New York City suggests.   In the study of 7,177 very preterm infants born at 39 hospitals citywide, 28 percent of the babies died or experienced serious complications. Compared to white infants, however, black preemies were almost twice as likely to die or have severe health issues, while the odds were about 50 percent higher for Hispanic babies.   This disparity is due at least in part to the fact that white children have a better chance of being born at hospitals that take better care of preemies, researchers report in JAMA Pediatrics.   \u201cNearly 40 percent of the black-white disparity and nearly a third of the Hispanic-white disparity can be attributed to hospital of birth,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth Howell, director of the Women\u2019s Health Research Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.   \u201cHospital quality is an important and modifiable cause of racial/ethnic disparities in neonatal outcomes,\u201d Howell said by email.   Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term. The study focused on the most vulnerable preterm infants, delivered from 24 to 31 weeks\u2019 gestation.  During the weeks immediately after birth, preemies often have difficulty breathing and digesting food. They can also encounter longer-term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing and cognitive skills, as well as social and behavioral problems.  While black newborns in the U.S. have long had higher mortality rates than white infants, much of this disparity has been attributed to the fact that black women are more likely to have preemies, Howell noted.   For the study, Howell and colleagues examined data for infants born in New York City from 2010 to 2014.   Over this time, about 8 percent died within four weeks of birth or within one year if they were continuously hospitalized. Almost 23 percent of the babies experienced serious medical complications.  Babies were more likely to die or suffer serious health issues when their mothers were born outside the U.S. or had diabetes or high blood pressure.   Outcomes varied widely by hospital, with mortality and complication rates ranging from about 10 percent to almost 58 percent.   When researchers sorted hospitals into three groups from the lowest to highest death and complication rates, they found black and Hispanic babies were more likely to be born at the worst-performing hospitals.   About 43 percent of black preemies and 34 percent of Hispanic preemies were born at the hospitals with the worst mortality and complication rates, compared with 23 percent of white preemies, the study found.   The study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how racial or ethnic disparities might develop among preemies. Researchers also lacked data on some factors that can influence outcomes for these babies, such as neighborhood poverty or exposure to environmental toxins.   \u201cBefore we make any further inferences, we need to know what is the cause of where these women are delivering,\u201d said Ciaran Phibbs, a researcher at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the VA Palo Alto Health Care System in California, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.   \u201cOnce we understand the problem, we can try to take steps to correct it,\u201d Phibbs said by email.   Expectant mothers can still try when possible to research the performance of hospitals and choose one that does well for these vulnerable infants, Phibbs advised.   \u201cMost deliveries are low-risk, and delivery hospital has no effect,\u201d Phibbs said. \u201cThe issue for high-risk deliveries is that they have a limited time of advanced notice.\u201d  SOURCES: bit.ly/2A7msNN and bit.ly/2A7ljpv JAMA Pediatrics, online January 2, 2018.

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - British reality television show \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d launched an all-female line-up on Tuesday involving politicians, a journalist and other performing artists to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.  The show, versions of which have appeared in a list of other countries, features contestants being locked in a house and given arduous tasks with the public voting to evict them.  Television station Channel 5 said 12 women would join the start of the show including journalist Rachel Johnson, sister of Britain\u2019s foreign minister Boris Johnson. Names of the other contestants were not being released until the show aired.  The station said the series with an all-female cast was \u201ca salute to a centenary of women\u2019s suffrage\u201d but some male celebrities would enter the house over the course of the series.  \u201cThe housemates will take part in a series of entertaining tasks and hidden experiments which will test their - and our - assumptions, challenge gender stereotypes and reveal fascinating truths about what it is to be a woman - and man - in the 21st century,\u201d Channel 5 said in a statement.  The show comes at the start of a year when Britain will host a range of events to mark 100 years since women got the vote after years of battling for equal rights.  Millicent Fawcett, who formed the National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies in 1897 and spent decades advocating for equal rights including voting rights, is to become the first woman with a statue in London\u2019s Parliament Square.  Fawcett led a peaceful campaign for equal rights including petitions, lobbying members of parliament and non-violent protests. The movement gave rise to more radical suffragettes, whose tactics included hunger strikes, arson and bomb attacks.  Britain granted women aged over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote in 1918, but it wasn\u2019t until 1928 that all women had the same voting rights as men.  The Royal Mint will launch a 50 pence coin to commemorate the anniversary, the Houses of Parliament will host a gamut of events with the hashtag #vote100, while nearby Westminster Hall will put on a public exhibition \u201cVoice and Vote\u201d.

The ECB has said it will buy bonds at least until September and it is widely expected to wind down the 2.55 trillion-euro  scheme, the centerpiece of its efforts to revive inflation in the euro zone, after that.  Nowotny\u2019s comments, echoing those of board member Benoit Coeure at the weekend, are likely to help cement those expectations.  \u201cIf the economy continues to do so well, we could let the program run out in 2018,\u201d Nowotny told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview carried out before Christmas and due to be published on Wednesday.  The ECB\u2019s stimulus has helped pull the euro zone back from the brink of deflation, with price growth now comfortably above 1 percent.  Even if the inflation rate is still expected to miss the ECB\u2019s target of close to but below 2 percent for years to come, Nowotny said policymakers should be flexible about it.  \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to explain why 1.5 percent isn\u2019t enough and 1.9 percent would be better,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think we should not see that too dogmatically.\u201d  Reporting By Francesco Canepa, editing by Larry King"

Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico had reported that the talks have focused on joint ventures and joint business agreements to share costs and revenue or develop new products without changing control of Embraer.  Such an arrangement could ease approval from the Brazilian government, which holds a \u2018golden share\u2019 giving it veto rights over strategic decisions at Embraer and has expressed reservations about a foreign company taking control.  However, a joint venture may not be an effective way to combine engineering resources, explore new business opportunities and satisfy Boeing\u2019s interest in Embraer\u2019s portfolio of regional passenger jets, defense programs and business aircraft, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of talks.   Boeing has worked around concerns in foreign markets before, structuring defense subsidiaries in Australia and Britain to satisfy sovereignty demands, and those cases may serve as a reference in Brazil, the sources said.  Neither Boeing nor Embraer responded to requests for comment.  On Dec. 21, the two planemakers said they were discussing a \u201cpotential combination,\u201d in a move that could consolidate a global passenger jet duopoly.  The talks are widely seen as a way for Boeing to strengthen its position in the regional jetliner market, in which Embraer is strong, thanks largely to its 70- to 130-seat E-Jets.   Less than three months ago, Boeing\u2019s European arch-rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc\u2019s (BBDb.TO) 100- to 130-seat CSeries jet, putting pressure on the U.S. planemaker to seek a similar partnership.  The Boeing-Embraer talks involve Embraer\u2019s defense business, as well as its passenger business, sources have said.  In the Tuesday report, Valor said Boeing was confident it could convince Brazil\u2019s government that it could safely operate in Brazil\u2019s defense sector, partially by pointing to defense deals the U.S. planemaker has made in countries such as Australia.

          "body": "(Recasts lead paragraph, adds quote)  By Richard Leong  NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Traders increased their purchases of U.S. three-month Treasury bills at a record-size auction on Tuesday in a sign they expect Congress to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling by late March.  A measure of overall demand at the latest three-month bill sale rebounded to its strongest in a month from its below-average level in recent weeks.  \u201cToday\u2019s issue matures in April, when presumably Congress will have reached a solution for the debt ceiling problems,\u201d said Tom Simons, money market strategist at Jefferies & Co. said in a research note.  The Treasury would exhaust all of its borrowing options and run dry of cash to pay its bills by late March or early April if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling before then, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.  \u201cIn past debt ceiling episodes, certain dates have been avoided well in advance of the cash squeeze because investors do not want to be left holding the bag should liquidity dry up,\u201d Simons wrote.  The pickup in demand for the three-month issue was muted by a heavy calendar of T-bill issues as traders returned from a three-day New Year\u2019s holiday weekend.  U.S. financial markets were closed on Monday.  The Treasury on Tuesday sold a record $48 billion of three-month bills at an interest rate of 1.435 percent, which was not far below the highest since Sept. 2008 set the previous week, Treasury data showed.  The ratio of bids to the amount of three-month T-bills offered was 3.08, the highest in a month. This gauge of overall auction demand was 2.71 at the previous three-month bill sale last week.  It also auctioned a record $42 billion of six-month T-bills, $50 billion in one-month bills and $20 billion in one-year bills.

          "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank may end its stimulus program this year if the euro zone economy continues to grow strongly, ECB rate-setter Ewald Nowotny told a German newspaper.  The ECB has said it will buy bonds at least until September and it is widely expected to wind down the 2.55 trillion-euro  scheme, the centerpiece of its efforts to revive inflation in the euro zone, after that.  Nowotny\u2019s comments, echoing those of board member Benoit Coeure at the weekend, are likely to help cement those expectations.  \u201cIf the economy continues to do so well, we could let the program run out in 2018,\u201d Nowotny told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview carried out before Christmas and due to be published on Wednesday.  The ECB\u2019s stimulus has helped pull the euro zone back from the brink of deflation, with price growth now comfortably above 1 percent.  Even if the inflation rate is still expected to miss the ECB\u2019s target of close to but below 2 percent for years to come, Nowotny said policymakers should be flexible about it.  \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to explain why 1.5 percent isn\u2019t enough and 1.9 percent would be better,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think we should not see that too dogmatically.\u201d  Reporting By Francesco Canepa, editing by Larry King"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The golden age of TV programming is heading for a grisly finale. Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are on course to boost their spending on new shows and movies at a faster clip than the growth of the overall video-streaming market. Consolidation among traditional media groups is only adding to the frenzy. Something will have to give.  Netflix set off the arms race. In 2017, the company founded by Reed Hastings directed $6 billion toward licensing and original series like \u201cStranger Things.\u201d In 2018, executives plan to earmark up to $8 billion for content, a 33 percent increase year-over-year. Across the industry, the number of original TV shows has more than doubled to 455 between 2010 and 2016, according to research firm MoffettNathanson.  Along with Amazon, Hulu and Apple, the total spending on content by the big four media upstarts in 2018 will mushroom some 30 percent year-over-year to $18 billion, according to a Breakingviews forecast based on analysts\u2019 estimates. Yet the entire global video-streaming market is expected to increase 16 percent to about $21 billion, reckons PwC.  That means there has never been a better time to be a couch potato, but it\u2019s glum news for the companies themselves. The tangle of options in streaming services and programming chasing a finite number of subscribers suggests the industry is entering into an unsustainable investment battle \u2013 and a potential price war may follow as players try to rake in extra market share.  Netflix looks like a survivor. It was a first mover in video streaming a decade ago, and has 100 million global customers. The snag is that it is burning cash \u2013 up to $2.5 billion in 2017. Competitors Apple and Amazon could easily outmatch Netflix on content budgets if they decided to abandon financial reason. Amazon for instance coughed up $250 million for rights to the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d TV series, according to a report in Deadline Hollywood. Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s YouTube are lurking in the shadows, but that could change.  Hulu, with its hydra-headed ownership split among Twenty-First Century Fox, Comcast, Walt Disney and Time Warner, is in a weaker position. Its owners are separately planning their own direct-to-consumer products, adding to the competition. Then there is the possibility of consolidation as media firms bulk up their own content to feed their services. In the latest example, Disney has agreed to buy some of Fox including its stake in Hulu for $52 billion. The result is too many characters chasing not enough action.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. drug approvals hit a 21-year high in 2017, with 46 novel medicines winning a green light \u2014 more than double the previous year \u2014 while the figure also rose in the European Union.  The EU recommended 92 new drugs including generics, up from 81, and China laid out plans to speed up approvals in what is now the world\u2019s second biggest market behind the United States.  Yet the world\u2019s biggest drugmakers saw average returns on their research and development spending fall, reflecting more competitive pressures and the growing share of new products now coming from younger biotech companies.  Consultancy Deloitte said last month that projected returns at 12 of the world\u2019s top drugmakers were at an eight-year low of only 3.2 percent.  Many of the drugs receiving a green light in 2017 were for rare diseases and sub-types of cancer, which often target very small populations, although they can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. (tmsnrt.rs/2hGom21)  Significantly, the U.S. drug tally of 46 does not include the first of a new wave of cell and gene therapies from Novartis, Gilead Sciences and Spark Therapeutics that were approved in 2017 under a separate category.  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has hailed these products as \u201ca whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases\u201d. However, there is debate as to how cash-strapped healthcare systems will pay for them.  Under Gottlieb, the FDA has taken advantage of policy changes implemented in recent years to accelerate the drug approval process.   Procedures such as the agency\u2019s \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d designation have cut review times and helped to stimulate competition by adding multiple new drugs that often work in a similar way.   A wide choice of medicines with the same mechanism of action can be a double-edged sword for manufacturers, since it gives insurers and governments ammunition to drive down prices.  Pfizer and Merck\u2019s new diabetes drug Steglatro, for example, was the fourth product of its kind to win a green light in the United States, while Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic was the sixth of its type. Both were approved in December.   In cancer, AstraZeneca\u2019s Imfinzi was the fifth medicine to target a key protein found on the body\u2019s immune cells when it won approval last May.  For the current year, companies have more new products waiting in the wings, although the pace of FDA approvals may be tempered by the fact that several drugs that had been expected to be cleared in the first quarter of 2018 were actually approved in 2017.  In Europe, meanwhile, the focus will be on any disruption or delays to the approval process as the European Medicines Agency prepares to relocate from London to Amsterdam as a result of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.  He is the latest of dozens of high-profile men in media, entertainment and politics that have retired, resigned or been fired in the past few months following accusations of sexual harassment or assault.   \u201cTo bring an end to this disruption which has enveloped the Ballet and the School, I have decided that it is time for me to retire,\u201d the Danish-born ballet dancer and choreographer wrote in the letter.  Charles Scharf, chairman of the New York City Ballet, credited Martins with a strong performance during his tenure of more than 30 years as its ballet master-in-chief.  \u201cAt the same time, the board takes seriously the allegations that have been made against him and we expect the independent investigation of those allegations to be completed soon,\u201d Scharf said in a statement.

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Members of a gang who forced Vietnamese girls and women into slavery in nail bars in Britain have been jailed for a total of nine years in what police believe is the first case of its kind.  Giang Huong Tran, 23, Viet Hoang Nguyen, 30, and Thu Huong Nguyen, 49, were sentenced on Tuesday after being convicted of human trafficking and modern slavery offences.  Police said the \u201csophisticated money-making operation\u201d involved the exploitation of vulnerable Vietnamese teenagers who were physically and verbally abused.  \u201cThe victims worked for no money and were trafficked between nail bars according to demand,\u201d Senior Crown Prosecutor Eran Cutliffe said in a statement.\u00a0  \u201cThey were hidden from the authorities in order to avoid detection whilst being exploited in plain sight within our society.\u201d  The defendants were caught after police traced a missing Vietnamese teenager to a nail bar in Burton-on-Trent in central England, Stafford Crown Court heard.  The shop\u2019s owner Viet Hoang Nguyen, known as Ken, was sentenced to four years, while manager Tran, known as Susan, received a suspended two-year sentence.  Thu Huong Nguyen, known as Jenny, who owned a nail bar in the historic western city of Bath, was sentenced to five years.     Police said 60,000 pounds ($81,500) in cash was discovered concealed in a stuffed toy at her home.   Nguyen and Nguyen were convicted of facilitating the trafficking of victims to work in nail bars. Tran was found guilty on a forced labor charge.  Britain\u2019s Vietnamese community has set up nail bars across the country but experts say traffickers have piggy-backed off their success.  Vietnam consistently ranks as one of the top three source countries for potential victims of modern slavery in Britain.  Britain\u2019s anti-slavery commissioner Kevin Hyland has called for tighter regulation of nail bars and said a government estimate that there are 13,000 victims of forced labor, sexual exploitation and domestic servitude in the UK is just the tip of the iceberg.  Detective Inspector Clair Langley, of Staffordshire Police, said the speed with which the victims were moved around the country indicated a high level of organization.  \u201cThis is the first successful prosecution for child labor exploitation and child trafficking under the Modern Slavery Act and we hope it sends out a clear message \u2013 we won\u2019t tolerate this activity and we will bring offenders before the courts.\u201d  The Modern Slavery Act of 2015 introduced life sentences for traffickers, offered better protection for people at risk of being enslaved, and forced companies to check their supply chains for forced labor.  Detective Inspector Charlotte Tucker, who led part of the operation, said the case was \u201cdesperately sad\u201d.  \u201cAs a community we need to look out for the warning signs and do our part to stop this archaic practice once and for all,\u201d she said.

          "title": "Congo's top Catholic slams state's 'barbarism' after deadly protests",
          "body": "KINSHASA (Reuters) - The head of the Roman Catholic Church in Congo on Tuesday condemned a crackdown on protests against President Joseph Kabila as \u201cbarbarism\u201d, escalating a confrontation between the government and one of the country\u2019s most powerful institutions.    Security forces in Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least seven people in the capital, Kinshasa, on Sunday during demonstrations that Catholic activists organized to protest Kabila\u2019s refusal to step down from office, according to the United Nations.  Police spokesman Pierrot Mwanamputu, however, said on Tuesday that five people, including one police officer, had died in Sunday\u2019s violence and that the police had acted justifiably in each case against militants and gangsters.    In a rare appearance before the media, Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo, wearing a red prayer cap and gold cross, accused security forces of opening fire on peaceful protesters and desecrating places of worship.  \u201cWe can only denounce, condemn and stigmatize the actions of the supposedly valiant men in uniform, which are, unfortunately, nothing more, nothing less than barbarism,\u201d Monsengwo told reporters in the capital Kinshasa.  \u201cHow can we trust leaders incapable of protecting the population, of guaranteeing peace, justice and love of people?\u201d he said.   The Catholic Church is one of the few institutions in Congo to enjoy broad credibility. Some 40 percent of the population identifies as Catholic and the Church has long filled voids in education, healthcare and other services left by an absent state.  Its bishops have frequently spoken out against human rights abuses by the government and alleged plans by Kabila to remove term limits that forbid him to run for re-election.   However, it reverted to a more neutral posture as Kabila\u2019s mandate expired in December 2016 in order to broker a deal between the ruling coalition and opposition leaders.  Under the Dec. 31 agreement, Kabila was permitted to stay in office beyond the expiry of his mandate but required to step down after an election to be held in 2017.    Instead, Congo\u2019s electoral commission said later that the election could not be organized until December 2018, reviving suspicions that Kabila intends to cling to power. Kabila denies those charges and blames the delays on a slow voter registration process.     Dozens have died in protests over Kabila\u2019s future in the past two years and militia violence across the country has also risen, stoking fears the country will slide back into the kind of civil war that killed millions at the turn of the century.

          "title": "Airbus delivered over 700 jets in 2017, met target: sources",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) delivered over 700 aircraft in 2017, breaking company records and meeting its core industrial target for the year, industry sources said.  Exact figures have been kept under wraps ahead of an  announcement on January 15, but the sources said Airbus handed over a record monthly total of jets in December, surpassing the previous monthly peak of 111 seen in the closing weeks of 2016.  Coming on top of 591 deliveries posted between January and November last year, that implies deliveries of at least 703 aircraft in 2017 as a whole, up at least 2 percent from 2016.  A spokesman for Airbus declined comment.  Airbus stuck throughout 2017 to an official target of more than 700 deliveries for the year, but abandoned a more ambitious informal goal of more than 720 deliveries in October due to continued delays in engine deliveries for the A320neo family.  Airbus officials have said the delays have now eased, following a two-year wrangle with supplier Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) over late engines for the company\u2019s fastest-selling jet.  It is the second year in a row that Airbus has been forced to accelerate sharply in December, with that month\u2019s deliveries accounting for at least 16 percent of the annual total.  Without disclosing numbers, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier thanked staff in a memo for \u201chuge collective efforts\u201d that had seen the company break records for deliveries logged both in one month and in one year, industry sources said.  Still, insiders said the strong industrial performance would be seen by many as a personal coup for Bregier, weeks before he is due to leave the company after losing a bid to succeed Chief Executive Tom Enders, who is himself leaving in 2019.    Airbus is bracing for more internal changes this year as it emerges from a top-level power struggle and rows over the handling of corruption investigations, but ended 2017 with what appears to be a grand slam performance from its current regime.  Besides ending the year on record output, Airbus is also heading for a record December in new business after soon-to-retire sales chief John Leahy announced the firming up of more than 700 orders, equivalent to a year\u2019s production.  Both Leahy and Bregier are leaving Airbus in coming weeks, handing their responsibilities to executives from outside the planemaking inner circle: Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury, who will replace Bregier as head of the planemaking division, and Rolls-Royce (RR.L) civil engines head Eric Schulz, who will replace Leahy after he retires later this month.  Airbus will remain in second place on deliveries in 2017 behind the world\u2019s largest planemaker, Boeing (BA.N), but analysts say the outcome of the order race depends on how many of the new sales make it into the end-year tally of net orders.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The state of Delaware on Tuesday said it would sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for failing to ensure that nearby Pennsylvania and West Virginia curbed upwind air pollution from their power plants.  \u201cThe Clean Air Act entitles Delaware to relief from upwind pollution and the remedy we are seeking is reasonable and within EPA\u2019s authority and responsibility to grant,\u201d said Delaware Governor John Carney.   Delaware says more than 90 percent of ground-level ozone, or smog, in Delaware originates from emissions in upwind states. Despite previously petitioning the EPA four times in 2016 to crack down on the upwind pollution, the governor said the state has not gotten relief.  \u201cWe are simply asking that the EPA require these power plants that pollute Delaware\u2019s air to run their existing pollution control equipment when the plants are in operation,\u201d the governor said.  Delaware\u2019s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said that although the state has made strides in improving its air quality, out-of-state emissions keep it from meeting federal air quality standards.  \u201cIt is now time for EPA to hold upwind sources accountable for ozone emissions that are impacting downwind states,\u201d the department\u2019s secretary, Shawn Garvin, said.

          "body": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Nine inmates were killed, 14 were injured, and dozens escaped in a prison riot on Monday, national news media reported, in the latest example of Brazil\u2019s continuing difficulties maintaining control over its notoriously violent penal system.  According to newspaper O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, 106 prisoners escaped the prison in the city of Goi\u00e2nia, near the capital of Brasilia. Authorities recaptured 27 of the escapees, but the rest remained at large.  One of the nine killed in the mayhem was decapitated, news media reported, sparking memories of a prison riot that occurred one year ago today in the Amazon in which 56 people died, several of whom were decapitated and thrown over prison walls.  That riot, which was rooted in a long-standing gang rivalry, came at the beginning of a January marred by widespread prison violence, with 130 prisoners dying in the first 20 days of 2017.  Brazil\u2019s prisons, which suffer endemic violence, are often severely overcrowded. Rights group call prison conditions medieval, with food scarce and cells often so packed inmates have no space to lie down.  In comments on Monday to newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, the head of Brazil\u2019s prison guard union, Jorimar Bastos, criticized the amount of resources allocated for oversight at the Goi\u00e2nia prison, saying only five guards were assigned to watch over 900 prisoners.

          "title": "German parties at odds ahead of coalition talks",
          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) traded barbs about migration and tax cuts on Tuesday amid mounting questions about whether they can agree to renew the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that ruled Germany for the past four years.  Merkel, under pressure after failing to form a government three months after national elections, hopes to secure a fourth term in office by persuading the center-left SPD to join the government despite punishing losses in September\u2019s election.   Party leaders will meet for preliminary talks on Jan. 3 ahead of exploratory talks scheduled for Jan. 7 through Jan. 12, but a growing number of politicians now say Merkel might have to rule with a minority government, or face new elections.  SPD deputy leader Thorsten Schaefer-Guembel said recent comments by some conservatives were \u201ccounterproductive for every form of government formation\u201d and said they had sparked doubts about the will of conservatives to govern together.  He said a deal on a new coalition was far from certain and it was unclear if the talks could develop sufficient trust.  \u201cA minority government remains an option, even if Chancellor Angela Merkel doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge that,\u201d he said in an interview published Tuesday in the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper.  Schaefer-Guembel cited differences with conservatives on a range of issues and rejected as \u201cabsurd\u201d proposals by some conservatives to cut taxes for high-income earners.  Conservatives and the SPD are also at odds over healthcare, immigration, Europe, work regulations and pensions.  Schaefer-Guembel said he backed calls by SPD parliamentary leader Andrea Nahles to raise taxes for the wealthiest and urge fresh efforts to prevent big companies from evading taxes.  Merkel\u2019s Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has distanced itself from the SPD through policy papers calling for corporate tax cuts, reductions in benefits for asylum seekers, higher military spending and limits on immigration.  The powerful economic council of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU) said it will urge CSU party leaders to push for a minority government when they meet this week, arguing that Germany would face \u201cenormous financial burdens for generations\u201d if the SPD pushed through its spending plans in a coalition.  \u201cA grand coalition will be more expensive in the long term than a minority government,\u201d Wolfgang Steiger, secretary general of the council told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper.  The SPD initially wanted to stay in opposition, but agreed to explore the possibility of governing with the conservatives in the interest of political stability after Merkel\u2019s coalition talks with two smaller parties collapsed in November.  Experts say new elections could hand more gains to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that entered parliament for the first time in September. Merkel says a new coalition would be more stable than minority government.  Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, a CSU negotiator, told the Funke media group his party would insist on limiting immigration levels. It wanted to extend a temporary ban on family reunifications for migrants who were granted \u201csubsidiary protection\u201d, an asylum status for those not officially classed as refugees.  He said his party viewed it as a democratic responsibility to negotiate a new coalition if policy gaps could be overcome.  \u201cI hope the Social Democrats feel the same sense of responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an urgent need for action on the legislative front.... We urgently need clear majorities in parliament, we need reliable coalitions.\u201d  A top member of the pro-business Free Democrats, which dropped out of coalition talks with conservatives and Greens in November, said such a coalition remained a future possibility.  Alexander Lambsdorff, deputy leader of the FDP\u2019s parliamentary group, also told the Heilbronner Stimme newspaper that he did not exclude the possibility of new elections or a minority government. \u201cThat would not be nice, but it also would not result in a constitutional crisis,\u201d he said.

          "body": "(Repeats to insert dropped quotation mark from Trump quote in paragraph 2.)  * S.Korea offers talks with N.Korea on Jan. 9 at border village  * Moon says better inter-Korean ties linked to nuclear issue  * North keen to talk, but steadfast on nuclear programme  * Trump holds back judgment on talks offer  By Christine Kim  SEOUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - South Korea on Tuesday offered talks with North Korea next week amid a standoff over its weapons programmes, a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he was open to negotiations but that his country would push ahead with \u201cmass producing\u201d nuclear warheads.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who has led a global drive to pressure North Korea to give up development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States, held back judgment on Pyongyang\u2019s offer to talk, saying: \u201cPerhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!\u201d  The offer for high-level talks next Tuesday had been discussed with the United States, South Korea\u2019s Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon said, while a decision on whether to push back massive joint military drills until after the Winter Olympics which South Korea hosts next month is pending.  Cho suggested the talks be held at the border village of Panmunjom and said they should be focused on North Korea\u2019s participation at the Olympics, but other issues would likely arise, including the denuclearisation of North Korea.  \u201cWe look forward to candidly discussing interests from both sides face-to-face with North Korea along with the North\u2019s participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics,\u201d Cho told reporters.  \u201cI repeat: The government is open to talking with North Korea, regardless of time, location and form.\u201d  Should the talks be held, it would be the first such dialogue since a vice-ministerial meeting in December 2015.  Tension has been rising over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. North Korea sees regular war drills between South Korea and the United States as preparations for war.  But Kim said in a New Year\u2019s Day speech he was \u201copen to dialogue\u201d with Seoul, and for North Korean athletes to possibly take part in the Winter Games, but he persistently declared North Korea a nuclear power.  The White House has yet to offer a detailed response to the speech, which analysts saw as an attempt to weaken the U.S.-South Korean alliance and the U.S. led campaign to raise pressure on Pyongyang through sanctions.  A State Department spokesman said Washington was \u201cin close contact with (South Korea) about our unified response to North Korea\u201d and added: \u201cWe are confident in (South Korea\u2019s) commitment to hosting a safe and successful Olympic Winter Games.\u201d  South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed Kim\u2019s address and asked his government to move as quickly as possible to bring North Korea to the Olympics, but he stressed that an improvement in inter-Korean relations \u201ccannot go separately with resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme\u201d.  Trump said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea. \u201cRocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time,\u201d he said on Twitter, using his nickname for Kim. \u201cPerhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!\u201d  China, which has persistently urged a return to talks to ease tensions, said recent positive comments from North and South Korea were a good thing.  \u201cChina welcomes and supports North Korea and South Korea taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearisation on the peninsula,\u201d  Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.  Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean national security adviser, criticised Seoul for reacting so quickly to Kim.  \u201cI regret the government had even lost the flexibility to spend one day or two taking a deep breath and meticulously analysing Kim Jong Un\u2019s ulterior motive before hastily issuing a welcoming statement,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe government will have to strive more to come up with a countermeasure not to get caught in a trap set by Kim Jong Un.\u201d  Choi Moon-soon, governor of Gangwon Province where the Olympics are to be held next month, has proposed South Korea send cruise ships to bring North Korean athletes and officials to Pyeongchang, according to South Korean media.  Choi met North Korean sports official Mun Woong in China on Dec. 18 on the sidelines of a international youth football tournament where North and South Korea soccer teams competed, the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported.  This week\u2019s exchanges follow a year dominated by fiery threats from Kim and Trump, who warned that the United States would have no choice but to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies, even as U.S. diplomats pushed for a diplomatic solution.  North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan and tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead anywhere in the United States.  Kim said he would consider sending a delegation to the Olympics.  At the same time, he said North Korea would focus in 2018 on \u201cmass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment\u201d and that he had a nuclear button on his desk capable of launching missiles at the United States.

Major stock indexes closed out 2017 with their best performances since 2013 and the rally is widely expected to continue this year, helped by a cut in corporate taxes that is anticipated to boost profits as well as the economy.  \u201cIt is seasonally a very good time for equities as new money comes into work,\u201d said John Brady, senior vice president at futures brokerage R.J. O\u2019Brien & Associates in Chicago.  \u201cIt seems as if most economists have raised their GDP forecasts for 2018, and we\u2019re going to get some form of a fiscal stimulus into an economy that has a tight labor market. The market is pricing all of this in.\u201d  Gains in Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft pulled the technology index higher by about 1 percent, following a 37 percent surge in 2017 that made it the best performing S&P sector.  \u201cPeople are back to looking at what have been the winners,\u201d said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The S&P consumer discretionary index was up 1.35 percent, boosted by a 1.4 percent gain in Amazon and a 3 percent increase in Walt Disney.  Disney, Netflix and Discovery Communications climbed following brokerage Macquire\u2019s upgrade to \u201coutperform\u201d.  J.C. Penney, Nordstrom and Kohl\u2019s climbed after a bullish note on the retail sector by Citigroup detailed the benefits from the corporate tax cuts.  Oil prices dipped but hovered near their mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in major exporter Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.  Gold and copper prices extended their gains, but the greenback began the year on the back foot, with the dollar index slipping to its weakest level since September.  At 12:28 p.m. ET (1728 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 49.97 points, or 0.2 percent, at 24,769.19 and the S&P 500 was up 16.7 points, or 0.62 percent, at 2,690.31. The Nasdaq Composite was up 82.61 points, or 1.2 percent, at 6,986.00.  Shares of casino operators Wynn Resorts and Melco Resorts & Entertainment were down more than 2 percent after a report showed lower-than-expected rise in Macau gambling revenue in December.  Abbott Labs jumped more than 3 percent to a record $59.02 after two brokerages upgraded the company\u2019s stock to \u201coverweight\u201d.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,786 to 1,073. On the Nasdaq, 2,019 issues rose and 902 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"

          "body": "HOUSTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Cold weather gripping much of the United States is denting natural gas production in the nation\u2019s shale patches, with output of the heating fuel down more than 20 percent since last month in North Dakota\u2019s Bakken region, according to analyst estimates.  The United States relies more on natural gas than coal for heating and has ramped up exports of liquefied natural gas.  Flows of natural gas on interstate pipelines out of North Dakota dropped to about 1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Tuesday, down from about 1.3 bcfd on Dec. 25, according to Genscape data. One bcfd is enough gas to fuel about five million U.S. homes.  \u201cThat drop is due to the freeze off we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Andrew Bradford of BTU Analytics, an energy consultancy.  Natural gas production often can be affected by water vapor in pipeline systems freezing and hindering the flow of gas. Unlike crude oil, gas must be piped immediately to a processing facility.  The National Weather Service (NWS) issued wind chill warnings for much of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains on Tuesday.  In Hettinger, North Dakota, temperatures fell to -45\u00b0F (-43\u00b0C) on Tuesday morning, one of the coldest temperatures recorded on the planet for the day, according to the NWS.  Continental Resources Inc, the second-largest producer in North Dakota, declined to detail the effect cold weather was having on its natural gas output, but said it did expect a drop.  Hess Corp and Cabot Oil and Gas Corp, two of the largest natural gas producers and processors in North Dakota and Pennsylvania, did not respond to requests for comment.  The Genscape data relies on monitoring of interstate pipelines and does not take into account natural gas that may be used in state in power plants or for other uses. Texas and Oklahoma, for example, use most of their natural gas at facilities in state.  In Texas, natural gas transport on interstate pipelines is down about 20 percent. In Oklahoma, the drop is about 22 percent, and in Pennsylvania\u2019s Marcellus shale, the drop is about 5 percent, according to Genscape.  Natural gas demand in the lower 48 U.S. states is expected to reach an all-time high of 144.0 billion cubic feet per day on Tuesday, which would top Monday\u2019s record 142.0 bcfd, according to Reuters data going back to 2008.

          "body": "HOUSTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Shares of Weatherford International Plc fell more than 17 percent on Tuesday after the oilfield services company  abandoned a proposed joint venture with Schlumberger and instead sold its hydraulic fracturing business to Schlumberger, a bigger rival.  The deal with Schlumberger, worth $430 million, gave Weatherford roughly $100 million less than originally anticipated from the two companies\u2019 planned OneStim joint venture.  Weatherford has suffered steep losses since the 2014 oil price downturn and has said it plans to sell units to raise cash and reduce its $7.9 billion in debt.  The lower value of the deal, coupled with the loss of potential income from the joint venture in the booming pressure pumping market, drew a negative reaction from investors on the first day of trading since the sale was announced.  In late morning trade, Weatherford\u2019s shares were down 74 cents at $3.43.  \u201cEarly feedback from the buy side (energy hedge funds, predominantly) purports that this is a negative outcome for WFT (Weatherford), in that it is receiving less cash than originally contemplated, and is releasing the additional upside in its frac business had the JV been finalized,\u201d according to a research note from investment bank Simmons & Co.  Pressure pumping and completions businesses have been a bright spot for U.S. oilfield services companies still recovering from the crash in oil prices. Fully booked equipment and crews have, for example, sent shares of Keane Group , a smaller competitor, almost 37 percent higher since early December.  Weatherford would have taken a 30 percent stake in OneStim, which was expected to contribute to the its earnings.  \u201cThere was a scenario whereby Weatherford may have been in a position to monetize its 30 percent stake,\u201d said Byron Pope, a managing director in Tudor Pickering Holt\u2019s equity research division.  \"There would have been precedent for Schlumberger wanting to own 100 percent of the joint venture,\" he added, pointing to Schlumberger's acquisition of Cameron's ownership stake in their OneSubsea joint venture in 2016.

          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - Teens exposed to traumatic or terror events may have a higher risk for weekly and daily migraines, according to a study of adolescents who survived a terror attack in Norway.  The findings further the idea that violence and psychological trauma could lead to physical symptoms.  \u201cWe have very little systematic knowledge about the physical consequences of terror and violent events, especially since people may not see the association or go to the doctor,\u201d said study author Dr. Synne Stensland of the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies at the University of Oslo.   \u201cThere are people who are not getting the help they need for their physical and psychological complaints, especially when they become more severe or frequent,\u201d she told Reuters Health by phone.   On July 22, 2011, a lone gunman opened fire on the annual Norwegian Labor Party youth summer camp. The man, disguised as a policeman, killed 69 people and severely wounded 33. Many of the 358 survivors saw what happened and risked hypothermia and drowning trying to escape. Most lost friends.  The survivors have been part of several studies to understand how terror and trauma affect adolescents. In this study, published in the journal Neurology, Stensland and colleagues looked at recurrent migraines and tension-type headaches in 213 of the survivors, ages 13 to 20. Trained personnel interviewed the survivors about four months after the attack, again 18 months afterward, and again three years after the attack.   The research team found the terror attack survivors reported many recurring tension-type headaches and migraines, and headaches were generally more common in girls. In particular, the female survivors reported three times more weekly or daily headaches than similar young women in the general population in Norway.   Posttraumatic psychological distress levels were much higher, too.  \u201cWe were surprised . . . the link was so strong between terror and headaches, even though we accounted for (many other factors),\u201d Stensland said.   Future studies will continue to observe the physical and psychological symptoms that these teens experience.   \u201cIncidents of terror are unfortunately commonplace worldwide, and although the physical effects are well covered, the invisible scars of psychological trauma receive much less attention,\u201d said Dr. Gretchen Tietjen, director of The Headache Treatment and Research Program at the University of Toledo, Ohio, who wasn\u2019t involved with this study.  \u201cPsychological trauma during critical periods of development affects the brain in ways that alter not only the psyche, but also the metabolic, immune, endocrine and nervous systems,\u201d she told Reuters Health by email. \u201cThese changes lead to increased susceptibility to a wide variety of adult diseases that may even be passed on to the next generation.\u201d  These associations extend beyond terror events to childhood maltreatment, emotional abuse and sexual violence, Stensland added. Abuse in peer relationships or social media bullying can have a similar effect.  \u201cThey\u2019re keeping a secret and don\u2019t want others to know what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people to know that an increase in headaches could indicate something has happened, and it\u2019s time to talk.\u201d  Stensland would also like to see research on medication and overuse of painkillers. Teens may be able to treat their headaches with over-the-counter medicine, but that doesn\u2019t treat the underlying issues related to the traumatic event, she noted.  \u201cAdolescents medicate themselves, and few go to the doctor, but if you keep medicating like that, it may actually contribute to the chronic behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cSeek help early. That\u2019s the key.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2A7OdFS Neurology, online December 13, 2017."

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The Bavarian allies of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative party on Tuesday said minors seeking asylum should undergo medical age tests, a measure the German Medical Association said could be a violation of ethics.  A debate about verifying the ages of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum has intensified since last week, after the fatal stabbing of a 15-year-old German girl by a suspect identified by police as her former boyfriend, an Afghan migrant.  The suspect\u2019s documents say he is 15, but the girl\u2019s father told German media he believed the migrant was older.  Germany is undergoing a fierce national discussion over migration since Chancellor Angela Merkel accepted more than a million migrants in 2015, mainly fleeing conflicts in the Middle East. In an election in September, the issue helped bring the far-right AfD party into parliament for the first time.  In the past three years, German authorities have registered nearly 70,000 unaccompanied minors seeking asylum. Critics of government policy have argued that some of them may not be minors, and could be falsifying their ages to qualify for extra benefits and protection from deportation.  Immigration is likely to be a major issue as Merkel seeks to renew a coalition agreement with the center-left SDP party, after both her ruling conservatives and the SDP lost votes in the election. The Bavarian CSU party, which is part of her conservative bloc, has sought a tougher line in particular.  A CSU draft resolution calls for mandatory tests for minors seeking asylum when there is doubt about their ages.  \u201cI believe that we will require in the future, from all allegedly underage refugees for whom we have specific doubts about their minority, a compulsory medical assessment on entering\u201d the country, said Stephan Mayer, a CSU domestic policy expert.  Mayer said medical tests in other EU countries such as Austria and Sweden had revealed that a significant proportion of age information provided by asylum seekers was incorrect.  \u201cParticularly, since numerous privileges such as much more complex care and a ban on deportation are tied to the status of being minor,\u201d Mayer told Reuters on Tuesday.  The head of the German Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, said an age test, which could involve X-rays of teeth and wrist bones, could be unethical and inaccurate.  \u201cThe examination is laborious, expensive and is loaded with major uncertainties,\u201d Montgomery told Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. The tests involved exposing people to radiation, which is normally impermissible without a medical indication, except in criminal proceedings, he said.

The plant was slated to be shut as part of a global restructuring in which the world\u2019s largest generic drugmaker will cut more than a quarter of its workforce, or 14,000 jobs.  Since the cost-cutting plan was announced last month, workers from the tablet plant, which employs 500 people, and an adjacent inhaler plant about half the size have been protesting and disrupting operations.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stepped in, asking the Israeli-based company not to close the site - a request Teva rejected.  \u201cThe parties reached full agreement on how to close the tablet factory in Jerusalem at the end of 2019, with the immediate end of the labor dispute in the tablet factory and an orderly return to work,\u201d the company said in a statement.

Negotiations regarding the fate of the inhaler plant next door are continuing, said a company spokesman.

          "body": "JUBA (Reuters) - The United States, Britain and Norway have called on parties in South Sudan\u2019s conflict to stop violating a ceasefire signed last month, their heads of mission in the capital Juba said on Tuesday.  The deal aimed to end a four-year war between the government of President Salva Kiir and rebels in which tens of thousands of people have been killed.  But since the signing of the deal in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, there have been several reported violations for which both sides have been blamed.  The United States, Britain and Norway form a group that supported the 2005 accord leading to the independence of South Sudan from Sudan. They have threatened to impose individual or group sanctions for those violating the ceasefire.  \u201cWe call on all signatories, and the field commanders who answer to them, to immediately end all military operations,\u201d the three Western countries said in a statement.  They added that field commanders and their political bosses would be held accountable for violating the ceasefire and impeding humanitarian assistance.  The ceasefire is also designed to allow humanitarian groups access to civilians caught in the fighting and revive a 2015 peace deal that collapsed in 2016 after heavy fighting erupted in Juba.  On Tuesday, a spokesman for a faction now allied with the government said rebels had attacked their positions on Dec. 31. He said one of the attackers was killed and two were captured alive in the incident.  The ceasefire was meant to be followed by talks on a revised power-sharing arrangement leading to a new date for polls.  The war in South Sudan, the world\u2019s youngest country, was triggered by Kiir\u2019s decision in 2013 to sack his deputy, Riek Machar. It has been fought largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and Machar, who is Nuer.  The war has forced a third of the 12 million-strong population to flee their homes.   On Monday, the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said it was investigating an allegation by one of the rebel groups that Kenyan security forces unlawfully deported one of their senior members from Kakuma refugee camp over the weekend.  Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said the deportation from Kenya was a violation of the ceasefire.  Spokesmen for the Kenya police and the foreign affairs ministry told Reuters on Tuesday they were not aware of the incident.   South Sudan\u2019s presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told Reuters the Juba government had no link to any missing citizens in Kenya.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks faltered at the start of the trading year on Tuesday as autos stocks fell and strength in the euro weighed, while trading was cautious ahead of the launch of a major reform of European Union financial markets.  The pan-European STOXX 600  index dipped 0.2 percent, as did euro zone stocks .STOXXE.  Autos stocks .SXAP were 0.1 percent lower, dented by weaker car registrations data.   New car sales in France fell 0.51 percent in December and the share of new diesel cars dipped below 50 percent for the first time since 2000.  A trader also pointed to a report in Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph citing forecasts that UK car registrations data, due out on Friday, would show a 5 percent decline in new car sales.  Schaeffler (SHA_p.DE) fell 4.9 percent, while BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) were both around 0.5 percent lower, recovering early losses slightly.   Basic resources stocks also bounced back from early declines with the sector index .SXPP rising 1.2 percent.   The mining sector built on the five-year high it reached at the end of last week, riding a wave of rising copper and other base metal prices.  Oil, which marked its highest start to the trading year since 2014, supported benchmarks with oil majors across the region rising in concert with crude.  More broadly, trading volumes in European equities remained muted as traders came back from holidays and ahead of the launch of new rules for the region\u2019s financial markets.  In other eye-catching moves, Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) slipped 1.4 percent after British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) agreed to buy Air Berlin\u2019s insolvent Austrian airline Niki.  The German carrier had backed out of a deal to buy Niki\u2019s assets in mid-December due to competition concerns.  \u201cThe circa 20 planes not acquired through Niki are a loss but not significant for the Lufthansa investment case from our point of view,\u201d said Bernstein analysts.  Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (SNHG.DE) surged 10 percent to the top of the STOXX, despite the firm saying its 2015 results would also have to be restated. The company also said its internal review of accounting irregularities was progressing.  Broker moves also drove trading: an upgrade to \u201cbuy\u201d from Sydbank sent wind turbine maker Vestas Wind (VWS.CO) up 2.6 percent after the company secured several new orders.   The Danish bank said a flurry of new orders and less uncertainty in the U.S. market indicated activity in 2018 could be higher than expected.

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO/LONDON, January 02 (Fitch) U.S. tax reforms set to take effect in 2018 will have both positive and negative consequences for the country's life insurers, Fitch Ratings says. The cut in the corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% could boost life insurers' cash flows and earnings, depending on how much of the tax saving insurers pass to customers through higher crediting rates or lower pricing. However, the tax cut will be negative for insurers' risk-based capital (RBC) positions due to likely higher RBC requirements and lower deferred tax assets (DTAs). Importantly, the reforms do not affect the tax-advantaged status of life and annuity products - a reduction in these tax advantages could have triggered a material fall in product sales. RBC requirements are likely to increase given the reduced tax offset to RBC charges for credit, market, insurance and operational risk. To date, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has not indicated any plans to introduce RBC formula changes or transitional measures to mitigate the reduced tax offset. We expect DTAs admitted on insurers' statutory balance sheets to decline by nearly 40%, on average, as a result of the tax cut. Admitted DTAs represent 8% of statutory capital across the industry but are more material for some insurers. The negative impacts on capitalization will be alleviated by an increase in the value of the margins in insurers' statutory reserves, given the lower tax rate that will now apply when margins are released. These margins are the amount of reserve in excess of a best-estimate reserve and include provisions for adverse deviation and deferred gains. We expect that insurers whose RBC levels fall below target as a result of the tax changes will plan to restore RBC over time. The tax reforms will reduce the amount of separate account \"dividends received deduction\" that insurers can claim, which will reduce the benefit to insurers' earnings from the corporate tax rate cut. The reforms may also lead to less use of affiliated offshore reinsurance as base erosion provisions in the tax act are expected to reduce the associated tax benefit. Contact: Douglas L.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks faltered at the start of the trading year on Tuesday as autos stocks fell and strength in the euro weighed, while trading was cautious ahead of the launch of a major reform of European Union financial markets.  The pan-European STOXX 600  index dipped 0.2 percent, as did euro zone stocks .STOXXE.  Autos stocks .SXAP were 0.1 percent lower, dented by weaker car registrations data.   New car sales in France fell 0.51 percent in December and the share of new diesel cars dipped below 50 percent for the first time since 2000.  A trader also pointed to a report in Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph citing forecasts that UK car registrations data, due out on Friday, would show a 5 percent decline in new car sales.  Schaeffler (SHA_p.DE) fell 4.9 percent, while BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) were both around 0.5 percent lower, recovering early losses slightly.   Basic resources stocks also bounced back from early declines with the sector index .SXPP rising 1.2 percent.   The mining sector built on the five-year high it reached at the end of last week, riding a wave of rising copper and other base metal prices.  Oil, which marked its highest start to the trading year since 2014, supported benchmarks with oil majors across the region rising in concert with crude.  More broadly, trading volumes in European equities remained muted as traders came back from holidays and ahead of the launch of new rules for the region\u2019s financial markets.  In other eye-catching moves, Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) slipped 1.4 percent after British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) agreed to buy Air Berlin\u2019s insolvent Austrian airline Niki.  The German carrier had backed out of a deal to buy Niki\u2019s assets in mid-December due to competition concerns.  \u201cThe circa 20 planes not acquired through Niki are a loss but not significant for the Lufthansa investment case from our point of view,\u201d said Bernstein analysts.  Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (SNHG.DE) surged 10 percent to the top of the STOXX, despite the firm saying its 2015 results would also have to be restated. The company also said its internal review of accounting irregularities was progressing.  Broker moves also drove trading: an upgrade to \u201cbuy\u201d from Sydbank sent wind turbine maker Vestas Wind (VWS.CO) up 2.6 percent after the company secured several new orders.   The Danish bank said a flurry of new orders and less uncertainty in the U.S. market indicated activity in 2018 could be higher than expected.

Flying rights are currently governed by EU-wide deals and because it is not part of the World Trade Organization, the aviation sector has no natural fallback arrangement to protect flights if there is no deal between Britain and the European Union.  Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest airline by passenger numbers, follows fellow budget airline Wizz Air in applying for a separate licence in Britain via a UK subsidiary.  \u201cA subsidiary company Ryanair UK filed an application on Dec 21 last for an Air Operator\u2019s Certificate (AOC) with the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK. This may be required for Ryanair\u2019s three UK domestic routes in the event of a hard Brexit in March 2019,\u201d the airline said in a statement.  Ryanair said last year that it planned to pivot its growth away from Britain over the next two years as it fears the lack of clarity over Brexit will cause major travel disruption and hit demand.

          "body": "MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberian President-elect George Weah on Tuesday set modest goals for his six-year term, calling for Liberia to start exporting crops and repairing decrepit infrastructure, in his first interview since winning election last week.  Weah rode a wave of youth support to capture more than 60 percent of the vote in last Tuesday\u2019s run-off, but he will need to manage expectations as he attempts to revive one of Africa\u2019s worst-performing economies.  Later this month, he will replace President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa\u2019s first elected female head of state and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, in Liberia\u2019s first democratic transfer of power since 1944.   Seated outside his unfinished new house on a quiet dirt backstreet near the capital Monrovia, where a concrete sign announces, \u201cFriends of Weah say welcome\u201d,\u00a0the 51-year-old ex-soccer star began to tentatively fill in some of the gaps in his vague campaign promises.  \u201cI want for us to be self-sustained so we can export,\u201d he said, appearing at ease in a dark blue dress shirt and gold watch. \u201cThe government has a responsibility to have agricultural programs so people are able to grow their own food.\u201d  \u201cGhana exports, our neighboring countries export - we have the capacity to export,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey export and we can do the same.\u201d  Liberia spent years recovering from civil wars from 1989-2003 that killed hundreds of thousands of people and then was hit more recently by low prices for its chief exports, iron ore and rubber, and an Ebola outbreak from 2014-16.  More than 60 percent of Liberians depend on agriculture for their livelihood and multinationals like Malaysia-based Sime Darby have invested heavily in palm oil plantations. But the sector has languished due to low productivity, forcing Liberia to import more than 80 percent of its staple foods.  Weah has also made repairing Liberia\u2019s hollowed-out infrastructure a priority. He grew up in Monrovia\u2019s Clara Town slum and can look out on the derelict lots and gutted streets from the upstairs balcony where he spoke to Reuters.   \u201cThe roads for connectivity are vital. We have partners and we have revenue that we will make sure will come in to build our roads,\u201d he said.   Weah, who starred for top European clubs such as AC Milan and Paris Saint Germain in the 1990s, has parlayed his rags-to-riches biography into political success but faces criticism that he lacks the experience and knowledge for the job.  He has in turn promised to surround himself with first-rate advisers and appealed to Liberians living overseas to return home.      \u201cWe will have economists who will put us on track. They will look at what is in the coffers and then work out how to move forward,\u201d he said.  In the days since he became president-elect, security guards in sharp suits and ties have appeared outside the house and a new watch tower rises above 10-foot walls reinforced with barbed wire.   But Weah insisted that his new-found status would not go to his head.   \u201cI don\u2019t want my title to define my character,\u201d he said as he walked the property, exchanging jokes with the staff. \u201cI don\u2019t think as a president I will change.\u201d  Writing by Aaron Ross, Editing by William Maclean"

Britain\u2019s FTSE index ended the session 0.5 percent lower at 7,648.10 points, slightly underperforming European peers on the first trading day of the year after a record-setting 2017.  Small caps, more focused on the domestic economy and therefore less vulnerable to a stronger pound, declined just 0.2 percent, as did mid caps.  Consumer staples took the most points off the FTSE, just over 19 points, as shares in British American Tobacco, Diageo and Unilever, declined. They all source a significant portion of revenues from overseas.  \u201cThe FTSE will be hoping this is just a blip on its recent record high-hitting run, and not the creeping grip of concern as it heads into what could be a tricky season for updates from its key retailers,\u201d Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said in a note.  Volumes were also muted following the end of the holiday season, while the forthcoming launch of a major reform of European Union financial markets on Wednesday also kept trading cautious.  Though miners weighed earlier in the session, they reversed losses with Anglo American, Rio Tinto and Glencore all ending the session with gains of between 1.1 percent and 2.9 percent.  The sector rallied into the end of 2017, spurred by buoyant metals prices.  However energy group BP was down 1 percent after it said it expected a positive impact on future post-tax earnings from the U.S. tax overhaul, but also a one-off non-cash charge of about $1.5 billion on fourth-quarter results.  \u201cWhilst there is always the chance that the necessary hit turns out to be more, you would imagine the company has been conservative, meaning more likelihood that it in fact turns out to be less,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which said last week it would also take a one-off hit but benefit over the long term from the overhaul, was also 0.2 percent lower.  Compass Group fell 1.3 percent after world\u2019s biggest catering firm\u2019s outgoing CEO died in a plane crash on New Year\u2019s Eve.  In the airline industry, British Airways owner IAG added 2.7 percent after it agreed to buy Niki, Air Berlin\u2019s insolvent Austrian holiday airline, for 20 million euros.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Bankers will work through the night to iron out last minute hitches before Wednesday\u2019s launch of a major reform of European Union financial markets that aims to apply lessons from the financial crisis nearly a decade ago.  The new rules are already a year late due to their complexity and regulators have had to issue eleventh-hour guidance to banks and financial firms to avoid trading freezes as well as calming nerves of those not yet fully compliant.  \u201cFor the markets facing processes, there will be a very intensive through-the-night activity,\u201d said David Lawton, a managing director at consultants Alvarez & Marsal and former senior markets regulator at Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority.  The new regime shines a spotlight on the innards of stock,bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to report detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions.  Banks and trading firms have spent millions of euros getting ready for the big day. A report from Expand, part of the BostonConsulting Group and IHS Markit, has estimated that top global banks and asset managers will have spent $2.1 billion last year to comply with the rules.    Lawton expects the new regime to trigger consolidation as the competition it aims to promote proves too much for some.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling kicked off the first trading day of 2018 by climbing to a three-month high close to $1.36 on Tuesday, with investors brushing off weaker-than-expected manufacturing data to focus on upcoming Brexit talks.   The pound, which in 2017 recorded its best annual performance against the dollar since 2009 with an almost 10 percent rise, added to those gains on Tuesday.  It climbed as much as 0.7 percent to $1.3598, its strongest since Sept. 20, as the dollar weakened across the board.   Numbers showing growth in British manufacturing cooled last month from four-year highs had little impact on the currency. The monthly manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) came in at 56.3, at the bottom end of forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists but still well above the 50-level denoting growth.   \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult one to react to because yes it\u2019s a disappointment, but it\u2019s still a stunningly good figure,\u201d said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to sell the pound on the back of that number.\u201d    \u201cI get the sense with sterling that there is a \u2018wait and see\u2019 attitude,\u201d she added. \u201cWe all know that Brexit remains an enormous theme for sterling, particularly the start of the trade talks, and the market does need to wait to gauge the tone of those talks.\u201d  Foley added that German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s success in forming a governing coalition so as to secure a fourth term in office could also be crucial for sterling, because of a market perception that she was something of an ally for Britain and would want to get the country a favourable trade deal.   Exploratory talks between Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats are scheduled from Jan. 7 to Jan 12.  Against the euro, sterling strengthened 0.2 percent to 88.71 pence.   \u201cAs always, the course of Brexit negotiations will be important and developments in the coming weeks will be important given we expect a transition deal to be struck quickly,\u201d wrote MUFG currency strategists in a note to clients.  \u201cWe remain sterling bulls and continue to expect the pound to break above the $1.40 level,\u201d they added.   Brexit minister David Davis said on Tuesday that Britain wants to include financial services in a trade deal with the European Union which covers a full sweep of economic areas, and that any deal that left out the sector would be \u201ccherry-picking\u201d.

The incident took place on Monday in Achin, Nangarhar province, the statement said.  Two of the wounded service members are being treated at a medical facility and in stable condition, it added.  Nangarhar, on the porous border with Pakistan, has become a stronghold for Islamic State, generally known as Daesh in Afghanistan, which has grown to become a dangerous militant group since it appeared around the start of 2015.  The Taliban and Islamic State have frequently fought each other in Nangarhar and both have been targeted by sustained U.S. air strikes.  The exact nature of the relationship between the two groups is little understood. There have been isolated incidents in Afghanistan in which the fighters of both appear to have cooperated.  There are currently about 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan and under President Donald Trump\u2019s South Asia strategy, U.S. troops are allowed to accompany Afghan forces at the battalion level, potentially putting them at greater risk.

The new rules are already a year late due to their complexity and regulators have had to issue eleventh-hour guidance to banks and financial firms to avoid trading freezes as well as calming nerves of those not yet fully compliant.  \u201cFor the markets facing processes, there will be a very intensive through-the-night activity,\u201d said David Lawton, a managing director at consultants Alvarez & Marsal and former senior markets regulator at Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority.  The new regime shines a spotlight on the innards of stock,bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to report detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions.  Banks and trading firms have spent millions of euros getting ready for the big day. A report from Expand, part of the BostonConsulting Group and IHS Markit, has estimated that top global banks and asset managers will have spent $2.1 billion last year to comply with the rules.

MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.64 percent. The index set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value last year. (reut.rs/2zLv6kT)  On Wall Street, equity indexes advanced, buoyed by gains in technology and consumer discretionary stocks.  Major stock indexes closed 2017 with their best performance since 2013. In the U.S. market, the advance came amid strong economic growth and corporate earnings, low interest rates and hopes, now realized, of U.S. corporate tax cuts.  \u201cThe first week of trading usually suggests the overall trend of the markets which we expect to be positive,\u201d Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York, wrote in a note.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 73.3 points, or 0.3 percent, to 24,792.52, the S&P 500 gained 18.1 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,691.71 and the Nasdaq Composite added 88.45 points, or 1.28 percent, to 6,991.84.  Shares also rose in Asia. Shanghai blue chips climbed 1.41 percent and MSCI\u2019s 24-country emerging market stock index jumped to a multi-year high after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, however, was a rare laggard and lost 0.23 percent.  The dollar index, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.32 percent. It was hampered by market expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture.  \u201cInvestors remain skeptical about the Fed\u2019s outlook for three additional interest rate increases this year, especially given the extremely benign inflation backdrop in the U.S.,\u201d said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst, at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.  The dollar had already hit a three-month low on Friday, bringing its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worst performance since 2003.  Other currencies gained. The euro rose 0.38 percent to $1.2054 and hit a four-month high on Tuesday after data showed that euro zone manufacturers ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.  The Japanese yen strengthened 0.45 percent versus the greenback at 112.16 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3587, up 0.64 percent on the day.  U.S. Treasury yields rose in line with European government yields. A European Central Bank official said the bank\u2019s massive bond purchase program might not continue later this year.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 15/32 in price to yield 2.4651 percent, from 2.411 percent late on Friday.  The 30-year bond last fell 44/32 in price to yield 2.8097 percent, from 2.741 percent late on Friday.  U.S. crude fell 0.38 percent to $60.19 per barrel and Brent was at $66.37, down 0.75 percent. Oil prices earlier had enjoyed their strongest start to a year since 2014 amid large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.  Copper lost 0.21 percent to $7,232.00 a tonne, but that follows a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top.  Spot gold added 0.8 percent to $1,312.61 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.

          "body": "SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After a year of making threats and weapons advances, North Korea\u2019s leader appears to be using the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in South Korea as a tool to blunt growing international pressure on Pyongyang while leaving his nuclear arsenal untouched.  Kim Jong Un, in his annual New Year\u2019s Day speech, called for reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and flagged the North\u2019s possible participation in the Games next month, just across the border in Pyeongchang.  South Korea has been eager to involve North Korea to ensure the Games are not disrupted by any further nuclear or missile tests and as a way of re-establishing dialogue with the reclusive state.  Analysts say Kim\u2019s gambit is aimed at driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington, which has advocated a strategy of maximum pressure and insisted that all options, including military ones, are on the table.   But the move also targets the broader international consensus involving major players China, Russia and Japan that has tightened sanctions and deepened isolation for North Korea in recent months.  \u201cA major part of the Kim family playbook is to exploit and to widen the divergences in the interests, in the first instance between the U.S. and South Korea, but more broadly among the five major neighbors,\u201d said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until last April and now at the Asia Society Policy Institute.  North Korea has long followed such a strategy of intense provocations followed by conciliatory phases aimed at exposing rifts, he said.  \u201cThis is a classic united we stand, divided we fall situation,\u201d Russel said. \u201cIt\u2019s always easier to maintain five party solidarity when North Korea is behaving badly.\u201d  U.S. President Donald Trump has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea as it seeks to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.  On Tuesday, Trump said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea but he withheld judgment on Pyongyang\u2019s offer to talk.  \u201cRocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time,\u201d Trump wrote in a Twitter post, using his nickname for Kim. \u201cPerhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!\u201d  Washington says the full cooperation of China, Russia and other countries is vital to the success of this effort, which includes significant restrictions on trade and other ties with North Korea.  China, which remains North Korea\u2019s major partner, has curtailed trade in line with United Nations sanctions, but Washington has called for it to do more to isolate Pyongyang.  For a multimedia coverage of North Korea, click www.reuters.com/north-korea/  South Korea\u2019s government publicly welcomed Kim\u2019s overture, and President Moon Jae-in has pushed to ease tensions ahead of the Games by postponing joint military drills with American troops until after the Olympics.  Moon also said on Tuesday the improvement of inter-Korean ties was linked to resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.  The White House has yet to make a detailed response. However, powerful Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the United States would boycott the Games if North Korea attends.  \u201cAllowing Kim Jong Un\u2019s North Korea to participate in Winter Olympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet,\u201d Graham said on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m confident South Korea will reject this absurd overture and fully believe that if North Korea goes to the Winter Olympics, we do not.\u201d  The participation of North Korean athletes and officials in Olympic events may create some awkward moments for international leaders who have spent months painting the country as a pariah state, said Robert Kelly, a professor at South Korea\u2019s Pusan National University.    \u201cIt puts the South Koreans in a weird position because it potentially creates tension between U.S. and Japan who have gone to lengths to isolate the regime,\u201d he said.  Japan\u2019s relationship with South Korea is already seen as under some strain, with one former Japanese diplomat saying Tokyo was suffering from \u201cfatigue\u201d with Seoul and lacking confidence in Moon.   Still, analysts were skeptical Kim\u2019s gambit would do lasting damage to the alliance between Seoul and Washington, or to the international push for sanctions.  \u201cI doubt that there will be a substantial reversal in global economic and political isolation measures in the near term,\u201d said Scott Snyder, director of U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.     At the heart of analysts\u2019 scepticism is Kim\u2019s apparent lack of appetite for compromise on the main points of nuclear weapons, missile testing, or human rights.  \u201cParticipation in things like the Olympics are pseudo-concessions, because the North doesn\u2019t actually have to give up anything,\u201d Kelly said.  In his speech, Kim vowed he would spend 2018 \u201cmass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles\u201d to \u201cgive a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action.\u201d  That means further missile tests are almost certain, with more focus on \u201crealistic\u201d exercises than developmental tests, said Joshua Pollack, a senior researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.  \u201cThe major theme here for strategic forces is shifting from development to serial production, deployment, and increased readiness,\u201d he said.  If the United States wants to take advantage of any possible easing in tensions, it needs to drop its demands for a halt in testing as a precondition for talks, said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project in New York.  \u201cThe most important reciprocal step would be to scale back - not (just) postpone - the spring joint exercises,\u201d he said. \u201cFailure to try these steps will only ensure that unbridled North Korean weapons development continues.\u201d  Reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington and Josh Smith in Seoul; Additional reporting by Linda Sieg in Tokyo and Susan Heavey in Washington; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Alistair Bell"

Major stock indexes closed out 2017 with their best performances since 2013 and are expected to gain this year too, largely helped by a cut in corporate taxes that is anticipated to boost profits and the economy.  \u201cIt is seasonally a very good time for equities as new money comes into work,\u201d said John Brady, senior vice president at futures brokerage R.J. O\u2019Brien & Associates in Chicago.  \u201cIt seems as if most economists have raised their GDP forecast for 2018, and we\u2019re going to get some form of a fiscal stimulus into an economy that has a tight labor market. The market is pricing all of this in.\u201d  Gains in Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft pulled the technology index higher. The index had gained 36.9 percent in 2017, the best performing S&P sector.  \u201cPeople are back to looking at what have been the winners. It has been very momentum driven,\u201d said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The S&P consumer discretionary index was up 1.16 percent, boosted by Walt Disney\u2019s 1.8 percent rise and a 4.6 percent jump in Netflix following broker Macquire\u2019s upgrade to \u201coutperform\u201d.  Other media stocks such as Discovery Communications , Twenty-First Century Fox and Comcast also moved higher.  Oil prices dipped but hovered near their mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in major exporter Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.  Gold and copper prices extended their gains, but the greenback began the year on the back foot, with the dollar index slipping to its weakest level since September.  The week is heavy on data including December job numbers and reports on manufacturing and service sectors scheduled. The data will be closely watched for signs of further strength in the economy and the number of interest rate hikes this year.  Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting, where the central bank raised rates for the fourth time since the 2008 financial crisis, is set for release on Wednesday.  At 10:50 a.m. ET (1550 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 61.97 points, or 0.25 percent, at 24,781.19 and the S&P 500 was up 16.91 points, or 0.63 percent, at 2,690.52.  The Nasdaq Composite was up 79.83 points, or 1.16 percent, at 6,983.22.  Shares of casino operators Wynn Resorts and Melco Resorts & Entertainment were down about 2 percent after a report showed lower-than-expected rise in Macau gambling revenue in December.  Abbott Labs jumped more than 3 percent to a record $59.02 after two brokerages upgraded the company\u2019s stock to \u201coverweight\u201d.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,951 to 831. On the Nasdaq, 2,097 issues rose and 730 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"

          "title": "Immune cells linked to very early spread of breast cancer",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - Normal immune cells that live near milk ducts in healthy breast tissue may play a key role in helping early breast cancer cells leave the breast for other parts of the body, researchers say.   This could possibly cause cancer to metastasize, or spread, even before a tumor has developed, according to Dr. Julio Aguirre-Ghiso of The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and colleagues. The study was published online January 2 in Nature Communications.  In previous work, the team identified a group of early cancer cells that get disseminated into the body during the earliest stages of breast cancer, before any cancer can be detected.  In the current study, they report that immune cells called macrophages play an important part in this process. Working in mice and in human cells in the laboratory, the team found that dissemination occurs when macrophages are attracted to the milk ducts, where they trigger a chain reaction that enables the early cancer cells to leave the breast.   \u201cWe show that by disrupting this (process), we can prevent early dissemination and, ultimately, deadly metastasis,\u201d Aguirre-Ghiso said in an email to Reuters Health.  \u201cOur study challenges the dogma that early diagnosis and treatment means sure cure,\u201d he said.  It could also be a \u201cstarting point\u201d for a test that could identify patients with the earliest form of breast cancer, known as ductal cell carcinoma in situ, who may already have disseminated disease, he suggested.  Future work will involve identifying the type of macrophages involved in early dissemination and exactly how the process occurs, which potentially could lead to the development of novel therapies to prevent it.   The kind of large, double-blind clinical trial that could prove this approach is still far in the future, Aguirre-Ghiso noted.  \u201cEven so,\u201d he said, \u201cour findings point to the notion that early treatment of high-risk patients may prevent the formation of deadly metastasis better than the current standard of treating metastatic disease (only after it has appeared).\u201d  Cancer geneticist and researcher Dr. Theodora Ross of UT Southwestern in Dallas told Reuters Health by email, \u201cThe concept that macrophages are assisting in early metastases is so intriguing.\u201d But for now, she cautioned, \u201cthe extension of this hypothesis to humans remains speculative.\u201d  However, \u201cthe point that patients with small \u2018early\u2019 breast cancers are not necessarily cured (by early treatment) is a good one,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if metastases happen way before you ever see the cancer on a screening test?\u201d  (This version of the story fixes date in source link at end of story from 2017 to 2018)      SOURCE: go.nature.com/2A6Funy Nature Communications, online January 2, 2018."

          "title": "Starting new COPD inhaler tied to heart attack risk",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who use long-acting inhaled bronchodilators may have an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes right after they start taking these medicines, a Taiwanese study suggests.   COPD is usually caused by smoking, and symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, and wheezing. While some patients may use short-acting inhalers to quickly relieve occasional shortness of breath, people with more severe and persistent symptoms may be prescribed long-acting inhalers to help expand the airways and keep them open.  Compared to COPD patients who didn\u2019t use long-acting bronchodilators, those who did were 50 percent more likely have cardiovascular problems like a heart attack or stroke within the first 30 days of starting to use these inhalers, the study found.   The absolute risk of problems like stroke, heart attack, rhythm disorders, and heart failure was still very low \u2013 around 1 percent \u2013 and the increased risk associated with long-acting bronchodilators disappeared over time, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.   \u201cPatients should know that their risk for cardiovascular diseases will be increased after initiation of bronchodilators even though the treatment is essential,\u201d said Dr. Tadahiro Goto, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   While patients shouldn\u2019t stop using inhalers, they should be vigilant about seeking medical attention for symptoms that might indicate a heart problem, such as chest pains or a suddenly rapid heart beat, Goto said by email.   To assess the connection between long-acting bronchodilators and heart problems, researchers examined data on 284,220 adults with COPD who had never used these medicines.   At the start of the study, patients were 71 years old on average, and researchers followed them for an average of 2 years. During that time, 37,719 people developed severe heart problems requiring emergency medical care.   Researchers looked at long-acting bronchodilators in two different families of medicines \u2013 beta-agonists and antimuscarinic antagonists \u2013 and didn\u2019t see a difference in the risk of heart disease based on the type of drug or the dose.   The study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how long-acting bronchodilators might influence the odds of severe heart problems in patients with COPD.   While these medicines are designed to widen the airways, they may also accelerate the heart rate, constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure, said lead study author Meng-Ting Wang, of the National Defense Medical Center in Taipei, Taiwan.  Long-acting bronchodilators might also increase inflammation, which then leads to blockage of the blood vessels, Wang said by email.   It\u2019s also possible that heart problems that appear linked to the medications in the study might have been there all along and misdiagnosed in some patients, said Dr. Shawn Aaron, a researcher at the University of Ottawa Medical School who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   Patients should have a follow-up exam after they start using these inhalers to make sure they\u2019re not having symptoms that might be caused by cardiovascular disease, Aaron advised.   \u201cNo one should avoid these drugs if they are prescribed by a physician,\u201d said Dr. Prescott Woodruff, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   \u201cThey are very effective at improving lung function and reducing exacerbations in COPD,\u201d Woodruff said by email. \u201cThe initiation of these drugs, in this instance, can simply be a marker for worsening symptoms of COPD or cardiovascular disease that is mistaken for COPD.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2A6F4NM JAMA Internal Medicine, online January 2, 2018.

Flying rights are currently governed by EU-wide deals and because it is not part of the World Trade Organization, the aviation sector has no natural fallback arrangement to protect flights if there is no deal between Britain and the European Union.  Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest airline by passenger numbers, follows fellow budget airline Wizz Air in applying for a separate licence in Britain via a UK subsidiary.  \u201cA subsidiary company Ryanair UK filed an application on Dec 21 last for an Air Operator\u2019s Certificate (AOC) with the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK.

The $1.4 billion development of Port City, a project of China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) (601800.SS), the parent company of CHEC, began in late 2016 as part of Beijing\u2019s ambitious plans to create a modern-day \u201cSilk Road\u201d across Asia.  \u201cIt will be part of the new financial city,\u201d regional development minister Champika Ranawaka told reporters while accompanying Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on a inspection tour of the Port City development in Colombo.  \u201cThe investment will be $1 billion and we expect to sign the agreements this month in Beijing.\u201d  CHEC officials were not immediately available for comment.

About 60 percent of its total area is reclaimed land from the sea in the commercial heart of Colombo, adjacent to the main port and the historic Galle Face Green park. The rest is expected to be reclaimed by June 2019.  For the overall project, Sri Lanka anticipates an eventual $13 billion of investment in housing, marinas, health facilities, schools and other developments over the next 30 years. The project is expected to create over 83,000 jobs.   CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd, the Sri Lanka company handling the project for CCCC, aims to deliver the first site for construction by the end of 2018.

          "body": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (RYA.I) recently applied for a British air operating licence in a move it said on Tuesday may be required to keep its small domestic UK service operating in the event of a hard Brexit.  Flying rights are currently governed by EU-wide deals and because it is not part of the World Trade Organization, the aviation sector has no natural fallback arrangement to protect flights if there is no deal between Britain and the European Union.  Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest airline by passenger numbers, follows fellow budget airline Wizz Air in applying for a separate licence in Britain via a UK subsidiary.  \u201cA subsidiary company Ryanair UK filed an application on Dec 21 last for an Air Operator\u2019s Certificate (AOC) with the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK. This may be required for Ryanair\u2019s three UK domestic routes in the event of a hard Brexit in March 2019,\u201d the airline said in a statement.  Ryanair said last year that it planned to pivot its growth away from Britain over the next two years as it fears the lack of clarity over Brexit will cause major travel disruption and hit demand.   The Dublin-based airline\u2019s three intra-UK routes only account for around 2 percent of its business.  Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Adrian Croft"

While the team began training in freestyle soccer - a non-competitive art where players perform tricks with a ball - they soon decided to aim higher.  \u201cI started bringing the people in and coach Yousry, the team coach, called me to start training me on freestyle football,\u201d team captain Mahmoud Ibrahim Tawfik, who lost a leg in a road accident more than 20 years ago, told Reuters.  \u201cI told him I have another dream of becoming a real life soccer player not just a freestyle footballer who has skills.\u201d  The team hope to inspire other disabled Egyptians to take up the sport and eventually establish a federation which could regulate a domestic league for the disabled.  \u201cIn each governorate we are asking the players to form a team to spread the game,\u201d said team coach Yousry Mohamed Ibrahim.  Despite their enthusiasm, the team faces a raft of challenges: a lack of funding, a paucity of special playing crutches and difficulties finding a regular pitch for training.  Amputee Football has special rules: seven leg-amputee players play on each opposing team, and the goalkeepers must have one arm. Crutches are not allowed to touch the ball and there is no offside rule or limits to substitutions.   There are 42 nations who now have national amputee football federations, according to the World Amputee Football Federation. The next amputee football World Cup is being held in Mexico later this year.  Reporting by Cairo bureau; Writing by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Peter Graff"

Ireland has kicked off its funding drive with a syndicated sale every year since 2013 and was the first euro zone sovereign out of the traps this year, saying it would issue the new bond \u201cin the near future\u201d \u2014 language it has previously used when selling debt the next day.  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) said in a statement that it had appointed Citi, Danske Bank, Davy Stockbrokers, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Nomura as joint lead managers for the deal.  The debt agency said last month it would issue between 14 and 18 billion euros of long-term debt in 2018, including at least one syndicated deal.  Ireland raised over 17 billion euros on debt markets last year, facilitating the early repayment of some of its loans from a 2010 international bailout while also increasing its scarce pool of debt eligible for the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing stimulus programme.  Borrowing costs across the euro area shot higher on Tuesday as a cut in monthly ECB asset purchases became a reality, with hawkish comments from a top official and strong data hurting sentiment towards bonds on the first trading day of the year.  Irish eight-year bonds \u2014 the closest current issue to a 10-year benchmark bond \u2014 were yielding 0.71 percent on secondary markets near close of trading on Tuesday, giving an indication of how much Ireland may have to pay to borrow. The yield had risen by as much as 3 basis points to 0.72 percent as prices eased slightly after the NTMA\u2019s announcement. (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Catherine Evans)"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain may impose new taxes on tech giants like Google and Facebook unless they do more to combat online extremism by taking down material aimed at radicalizing people or helping them to prepare attacks, the country\u2019s security minister said.  Ben Wallace accused tech firms of being happy to sell people\u2019s data but not to give it to the government which was being forced to spend vast sums on de-radicalization programs, surveillance and other counter-terrorism measures.  \u201cIf they continue to be less than co-operative, we should look at things like tax as a way of incentivizing them or compen\u00adsating for their inaction,\u201d Wallace told the Sunday Times newspaper in an interview.   His quotes did not give further details on tax plans. The newspaper said that any demand would take the form of a windfall tax similar to that imposed on privatized utilities by former Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s government in 1997.  Wallace accused the tech giants of putting private profit before public safety.  \u201cWe should stop pretending that because they sit on beanbags in T-shirts they are not ruthless profiteers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will ruthlessly sell our details to loans and soft-porn companies but not give it to our democratically elected government.\u201d  Facebook executive Simon Milner rejected the criticisms.  \u201cMr Wallace is wrong to say that we put profit before safety, especially in the fight against terrorism,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested millions of pounds in people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content.\u201d  YouTube, which is owned by Google, said it was doing more every day to tackle violent extremism.  \u201cOver the course of 2017 we have made significant progress through investing in machine learning technology, recruiting more reviewers, building partnerships with experts and collaboration with other companies,\u201d a YouTube spokeswoman said.  Britain suffered a series of attacks by Islamic extremists between March and June this year that killed a total of 36 people, excluding the attackers.   Two involved vehicles ramming people on bridges in London, followed by attackers stabbing people. The deadliest, a bombing at a concert in the northern city of Manchester, killed 22 people.  Following the second bridge attack, Prime Minister Theresa May proposed beefing up regulations on cyberspace, and weeks later interior minister Amber Rudd traveled to California to ask Silicon Valley to step up efforts against extremism.  \u201cWe are more vulnerable than at any point in the last 100 years,\u201d said Wallace, citing extremist material on social media and encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp as tools that made life too easy for attackers.  \u201cBecause content is not being taken down as quickly as they could do, we\u2019re having to de-radicalize people who have been radicalised. That\u2019s costing millions. They can\u2019t get away with that and we should look at all the options, including tax.\u201d  Facebook said it removed 83 percent of uploaded copies of terrorist content within one hour of its being found on the social media network.  It also highlighted plans to double the number of people working in its safety and security teams to 20,000 by the end of 2018.  YouTube said that progress in machine learning meant that 83 percent of violent extremist content was removed without the need for users to flag it.

          "title": "Emerging markets sailed through storms in 2017. What next?",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - After a year of double-digit returns, one of the key questions for emerging markets in 2018 is whether they will continue to be insulated from one another\u2019s crises.  Contagion, an intrinsic feature of the sector for years, shrank to such an extent that an almost 10 percent drop in Brazil\u2019s currency in a single day in May had little effect on its emerging market peers.  Was that proof investors now treat individual emerging markets on their own merits, rather than as members of a homogenous poor and crisis-prone bloc? Or was it just a function of central bank money-printing and near-zero interest rates?  Both played a part.  Not too long ago, a selloff like that of Brazil's real currency BRL= on May 18 last year would have sent central banks in distant Asia and Africa scrabbling to defend their markets via interest rate rises or dollar sales.  Instead, its Latin American neighbor Chile cut interest rates with little weakening in its currency, CLP= while in the Middle East, Oman announced plans for a dollar bond.  Earlier that week, as the corruption scandal which exploded on May 18 brewed in Brazil, \u201cjunk\u201d-rated West African state Senegal borrowed $1.1 billion on bond markets.  \u201cBack in 2000, if Philippines sold off in the Asian morning, it meant Russia would sell off in the London morning,\u201d said Steve Cook, co-head of emerging debt at PineBridge Investments.  Cook said his fund did not exit Brazilian markets on May 18, opting instead to shuffle the portfolio towards companies which would benefit from currency weakness.  \u201cBrazil sold off because of political uncertainty but we knew it doesn\u2019t impact Colombia or Peru from a macro perspective.\u201d  But a 2008-style crisis emanating from the United States or China would still spark indiscriminate flight from emerging markets towards \u201csafe\u201d assets such as the Swiss franc, specialists say.  \u201cThe single-largest driver of EM performance is and will continue to be - growth. As we are seeing synchronized growth recovery, that\u2019s what is underpinning relatively low contagion,\u201d said Polina Kurdyavko, co-head of emerging markets at BlueBay Asset Management.  Kurdyavko bought Brazilian bonds after the selloff, judging that recovery from economic recession would continue and that \u201cthe fundamental story in Brazil is unchanged\u201d.  Around half of the May 18 correction reversed over the following week as local and foreign funds snapped up bargains.  Emerging bonds earned double-digit returns this year, shrugging off Venezuela\u2019s expected default, in a striking contrast to crises in Asia in 1997 or Turkey in 2001, shockwaves from which rippled through the developing world.  Change has been building for a while. There was little contagion from the July 2016 attempted coup in Turkey or Russia\u2019s 2014 meltdown and even in 2013, the so-called Fragile Five developing countries were far worse hit than peers when the United States signaled plans to start unwinding its stimulus.  Russia\u2019s decision on Dec 15 to cut interest rates by half a percent, just two days after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates, shows central bank policies are increasingly dictated by their own economic conditions, rather than the Fed.  Mexico and Turkey raised rates a day before Russia\u2019s cut.  Expectations of more U.S. rate rises and the European Central Bank halving its bond buying will test individual emerging economies in 2018, emerging market veterans say.  But the sector as a whole is insulated by sweeping changes within the asset class and its investor base in the past decade.  Improvements made since turn-of-the-century crises are easy to pinpoint - inflation-targeting central banks, floating currencies, and borrowing that is now 80 percent denominated in emerging currencies rather than dollars.  Increasing numbers of investors have also come to view emerging markets as a structural rather than short-term trade.  That includes many Western pension funds which a decade back may have shunned emerging markets as too risky but are now raising exposure to benefit from the high yields on offer.  Thomson Reuters fund research firm Lipper tracks over 13,000 dedicated emerging bond and equity funds, up from about 2,000 back in 2003. And just in emerging debt, the most widely used GBI-EM index is used as a benchmark by funds managing over $200 billion in assets, up ten-fold from 2007,   Because dedicated investors do not tend to bail out wholesale when crisis strikes, \u201ca crisis in one country can be supportive for the other,\u201d said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investments at Millennium Global.  Benson recalled when he started his career 15 years ago, most investment firms would have a tiny allocation to developing economies, just to diversify portfolios, whereas now 5-10 percent of total assets are likely in emerging markets  \u201cSo if there\u2019s a crisis in Turkey, you underweight Turkey and buy Korea,\u201d Benson added.  Other investors highlight the speed at which developing countries\u2019 own savings pools are growing, allowing governments in the more sophisticated Asian, Eastern European or Latin American countries to meet most of their financing needs from local pension and insurance funds.  And these local investors not only stay put during selloffs, they also usually step up to buy when foreigners flee, limiting market falls.  Chris Perryman, a portfolio manager working with Steve Cook at PineBridge, noted for instance that up to 70 percent of new Chinese bonds are now sold within Asia, versus a fifth when he first started trading emerging debt 14 years ago.  \u201cThat\u2019s due to the size of regional asset management capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dedicated flow has become more sticky and less likely to run for the hills.\u201d  To view a graphic on Emerging markets performance, click: reut.rs/2Ca59gP  (This version of the story has been refiled with an updated version of the graphic.)

According to a Harris Interactive survey for RTL radio, 59 percent of the French were optimistic for 2018, the highest level since 2010 and 15 points higher than a trough in 2012.  Supporters of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party were the most optimistic, the poll showed, while those of the far-right National Front were the most pessimistic.  \u201cThere\u2019s probably a bit of a Macron effect,\u201d Harris head of political polling Jean-Daniel Levy said, pointing to renewed hope about European integration, one of Macron\u2019s policy priorities.  \u201cThere is in particular the feeling of having a presidency that holds water, with good prospects on the economic front,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cIt\u2019s not only the end of the Hollande years,\u201d Levy added, referring to the broad sense of malaise that marked the 2012-17 tenure of Macron\u2019s Socialist predecessor Francois Hollande. \u201cThe French hear a lot about a better outlook for growth, for jobs. There are signs that show France is less depressed.\u201d  For the first time in five years, a majority of 51 percent of the French said the past year was a positive one.  That was in contrast with the 54 percent who thought 2015 and 2016 were negative - years that were marked by deadly Islamist militant attacks.

          "title": "Uganda's Museveni signs law removing age cap for president",
          "body": "KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda\u2019s President Yoweri Museveni has signed a law that scraps a 75-year age cap for presidential candidates, a spokesman for parliament said on Tuesday, a move critics say will allow him to remain in power indefinitely.  Museveni, 73, has ruled Uganda for 31 years and could now stand again in the next election, due in 2021, despite increased public anger over corruption, human rights violations and poor social services.  Parliament, controlled by Museveni\u2019s ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM), approved the constitutional amendment on Dec. 22 amid heavy security deployments across the capital Kampala and outside parliament.  \u201cIt has been signed into law,\u201d spokesman Chris Obore said, adding that the president had done so on Dec. 27.   Museveni\u2019s move quickly drew criticism from his political opponents, religious leaders, human rights activists and even some members of the ruling party.  Protests in September by opposition activists against the proposed amendment were quickly put down with detentions, teargas and beatings. At least two people were killed.   Some legislators opposed to the law tried unsuccessfully at various stages to filibuster it and some were suspended from proceedings. During the final debate on the amendment last month, some lawmakers scuffled with police.   Museveni is the latest of a growing list of African leaders  who have either changed the law or used other tactics to thwart opponents and hold onto power long after their tenure has ended.  In Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan, such moves have provoked instability.     Last month\u2019s vote by parliament was the second time the Ugandan legislature has amended the constitution to allow Museveni to stay in power. In 2005 they voted to remove a limit of two five-year terms, which had blocked him from standing again.  Despite the growing cries of autocracy against Museveni, Washington has backed him as a strongman who has turned Uganda into a bulwark of stability in Africa\u2019s troubled Great Lakes region.  The landlocked East African country is eyeing commencement of crude production in 2020 and the construction of a pipeline to export it via neighboring Tanzania is underway.

          "title": "Israel changes law to make it harder to cede Jerusalem control",
          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel\u2019s parliament passed an amendment on Tuesday that would make it harder for it to cede control over parts of Jerusalem in any peace deal with the Palestinians, who condemned the move as undermining any chance to revive talks on statehood.  The legislation, sponsored by the far-right Jewish Home coalition party, raises to 80 from 61 the number of votes required in the 120-seat Knesset to approve any proposal to hand over part of the city to \u201ca foreign party\u201d.  Last month U.S. President Donald Trump angered the Palestinians, Middle East leaders and world powers by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.   As home to major Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites, Jerusalem\u2019s status is one of the most sensitive issues in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump\u2019s Dec. 6 decision sparked regional protests and prompted the Palestinians to rule out Washington as a peace broker in any future talks.  Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described Trump\u2019s policy shift on Jerusalem and the passage of the amendment as \u201ca declaration of war against the Palestinian people\u201d.  \u201cThe vote clearly shows that the Israeli side has officially declared an end to the so-called political process,\u201d Abu Rdainah said, referring to U.S.-sponsored talks on Palestinian statehood that collapsed in 2014.  Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its \u201ceternal and indivisible\u201d capital.  Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.  The amendment, long in the legislative pipeline, was passed with 64 lawmakers voting in favor and 52 against.  Opposition head Isaac Herzog said Jewish Home was leading  Israel \u201ctoward a terrible disaster\u201d. Jewish Home\u2019s leader, Naftali Bennett, said the vote showed that Israel would keep control of all of Jerusalem forever.  \u201cThere will be no more political skulduggery that will allow our capital to be torn apart,\u201d Bennett said on Twitter.  A bid to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations led by the president\u2019s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has so far shown no progress.  On Sunday, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party unanimously urged legislators in a non-binding resolution to effectively annex Israeli settlements built in the West Bank. [L8N1OV0GP]  Political commentators said Likud\u2019s decision might bolster right-wing support for Netanyahu, who could seek a public mandate in an early election while he awaits possible criminal indictments against him on corruption suspicions. He denies wrongdoing.   Parliamentary elections are not due until November 2019 but the police investigations in two cases of alleged corruption against Netanyahu and tensions among coalition partners in his government could hasten a poll.  Some commentators, pointing to an existing law that already sets a similar high threshold for handing over territory in a land-for-peace deal, have said Jewish Home was essentially competing with Likud for support among the right-wing base.

          "title": "Euro zone factory growth surges to record; more uneven in Asia",
          "body": "LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Euro zone factories ended 2017 growing at their fastest pace in more than two decades while performance in Asia was more uneven, with its third-largest economy India leading the field and manufacturing giant China unexpectedly resilient.  With a similar business survey covering the United States forecast to be strong, the synchronized global growth that took hold last year looks set to continue based on the first major economic data releases of 2018.   Euro zone factory activity is handily outpacing its peers, including Britain. That has added to expectations that the European Central Bank, which this month will halve its monthly bond purchases, will shutter the program later this year.   \u201cThe euro zone manufacturing boom gained further momentum in December, rounding off the best year on record and setting the scene for a strong start to 2018,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the surveys.   The December euro zone final manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) was 60.6, matching an earlier preliminary reading, the highest since the survey began in June 1997. Any figure above 50 represents growth.  The euro rose to a three-month high above $1.20.  The factory output index, which feeds into a broader set of data including services due on Thursday, rose to 62.2 from 61.0 in November. That was its highest in over 17 years and a reading exceeded only once in the survey\u2019s more than two decades of history.  Germany and France, the euro zone\u2019s two largest economies look to be expanding in tandem, striking their highest manufacturing PMI numbers on record and for 17 years, respectively. But growth slowed in Italy, the bloc\u2019s third largest economy.  In Britain, which is in the process of negotiating a withdrawal from the European Union, growth tailed off sharply from a four-year high the previous month.  \u201cStrong growth will be hard to sustain in 2018,\u201d noted Samuel Tombs, UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. He pointed out that the UK PMI had underperformed the euro zone\u2019s by the most since June 2008.   \u201cBritish manufacturers ... are failing to make the most of the rebound in global trade,\u201d Tombs wrote.   Factory activity hit a five-year high in India and the best in 6-1/2 years in Taiwan, and also picked up in China. But activity contracted in South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia, a sign that regional interest rate hikes are likely to be gradual.  \u201cRobust external demand and accommodative domestic monetary policy should help keep Asian manufacturing sectors in good shape,\u201d said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics.  In China, manufacturing growth unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December amid a surge in new orders, suggesting continued strength in global trade.  The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 from 50.8 in November, and far outpaced expectations in a Reuters poll for a dip to 50.6.  The China PMI, which pushed Asian shares .MIAPJ0000PUS to their highest in a decade, was somewhat at odds with a much larger official China PMI survey on Sunday. It showed a slowdown in growth amid a crackdown on pollution and measures to curb risky financing and cool the housing market.  The difference, analysts say, stems from the fact that the Caixin/PMI index tracks smaller, private firms, more sensitive to exports.  China is expected to have grown by close to 7 percent in 2017, but the world\u2019s second largest economy is likely to slow in the new year on the back of those measures, highlighted as policy priorities at October\u2019s key Communist Party congress.  Beijing is expected to target 2018 growth of around 6.5 percent.  \u201cWe believe a moderate growth slowdown to be more visible in the first half of 2018, especially on the investment front, due mainly to the tight financial conditions and a cool down of the property market,\u201d BofA Merrill Lynch economists said.  China\u2019s slowdown means that for the rest of Asia, the pace of rate increases is unlikely to match that of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is likely to raise interest rates three times this year, and possibly more.  There will likely be \u201conly a few rate hikes here and there across the region over the coming two years,\u201d HSBC analysts wrote in a note, even as they expect Asian economies to keep chugging along in 2018, led by tech and trade.  India\u2019s PMI showed factory activity expanding at the fastest pace in five years, buoyed by a rise in output and new orders, which allowed firms to raise prices. The data firmed up views that interest rates in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy have probably bottomed.  PMIs for Japan, which surpassed growth expectations in 2017 on the back of the surging tech and trade cycle globally, will be released on Thursday.  The U.S. manufacturing PMI is due later on Tuesday.   Reporting by Jonathan Cable and Marius Zaharia; Editing by Ross Finley and Catherine Evans"

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors on Tuesday flagged 4 percent sales growth in 2018, suggesting a slow recovery from a slump linked to their lack of SUVs in the United States and diplomatic tensions with China.  Hyundai and smaller affiliate Kia said demand was expected to soften in the U.S. and Chinese markets as they unveiled a combined sales target of 7.55 million vehicles this year, from 7.25 million vehicles last year.   \u201cThe market environment is expected to be difficult due to a slowdown in major markets like the U.S. and China, prolonged low growth in the global economy and trade protectionism in major countries,\u201d Hyundai Motor said in a statement.  Sales slumped 7 percent last year from 2016, falling well short of the firms\u2019 target of 8.25 million vehicles and marking their third consecutive annual miss, as buyers in China and the United States increasingly shunned sedans for SUVs.  A diplomatic row between China and South Korea over Seoul\u2019s deployment of a U.S. missile defense system also hit the carmakers\u2019 sales in the world\u2019s biggest auto market, although two countries recently agreed to normalize ties.  \u201cThis year\u2019s target for Hyundai and Kia is lower than expected. It seems to be a conservative target, reflecting a slow recovery in China and ongoing U.S difficulties,\u201d Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities said.    Hyundai Motor shares ended down 4.2 percent on Tuesday, and Kia Motors stocks finished 2.1 percent lower. The broader market rose 0.5 percent.      The grim outlook came as the Korean won strengthened to a more than three-year high against the dollar on Tuesday, threatening the competitiveness of South Korean exporters as their Japanese rivals benefit from the weakening yen.  The expiration of a tax cut on small-engine cars in China also would be a negative for Hyundai\u2019s sedan-heavy line-up, they said.  While Hyundai Motor has plans to offer more SUVs in the United States and China this year, analysts said new models such as the redesigned Santa Fe SUV may come too late in the year to significantly impact sales.  Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong-koo said in a statement it would \u201cactively venture into\u201d new markets like Southeast Asia, as protectionism was expected to grow elsewhere.  South Korea and the United States will hold talks on a trade deal on Jan. 5 although U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the pact.  Chung, 79, skipped his annual New Year speech to employees for a second year in a row. He has not made any public appearances since December, 2016.

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The founder of debt-laden tech conglomerate LeEco has defied orders from Chinese regulators to return to the country before the end of 2017, saying he needed to stay in the United States as a fundraising for his electric car business was making progress.  The Beijing branch of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued a notice last week ordering LeEco CEO Jia Yueting to return to China to address a mounting debt pile linked to his firms and to protect investors\u2019 rights.  Jia said in a statement that he had asked his brother, Jia Yuemin, to meet the regulator face-to-face last Friday to provide a report after the notice was issued.   \u201cI am deeply sorry and blame myself for the negative impact of LeEco\u2019s debt crisis,\u201d he said in the statement that was posted on his official WeChat account on Tuesday.  \u201cThe fundraising for Faraday Future in the United States is making significant progress and there are many tasks I need to push forward in order to ensure the production and timely delivery of the FF91,\u201d he said, referring to a luxury electric vehicle (EV) that LeEco is developing with Faraday Future.   Questions have been raised about the outlook for the FF91, given LeEco\u2019s spiraling cash problems as well as its decision to pull out of a joint project with British sports carmaker Aston Martin to develop the RapidE electric car.   LeEco, an entertainment, electronics and electric vehicles group, has struggled to pay its debts after rapid expansion into multiple sectors sparked a cash crunch, a plunge in the shares of a listed unit and led to multiple defaults. At its peak LeEco owed creditors 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion).  Its main listed unit Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp (300104.SZ) said in a statement on Tuesday that it was trying to settle its debt problems to resolve liquidity issues and resume normal business operations.  Leshi\u2019s Tianjin unit is trying to get 3 billion yuan ($462 million) worth of funding from new and existing investors, as well as creditors, Leshi said in another statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange. That unit\u2019s main business is marketing smart and Internet TVs.  Struggling to support goals that included beating Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) in premium EV making, Jia has been trying to ride out the cash crunch by taking measures such as cutting staff numbers and selling assets.  Jia said he had asked his wife, Gan Wei, and brother to represent him at Leshi in exercising shareholder rights and handling the sale of assets. Jia stepped down as CEO of the group\u2019s main listed unit in May last year.  He also cited a single late payment in July as being one of the key causes of LeEco\u2019s cash-flow problems, saying it led to the freezing of his assets and prompted a slew of early loan recoveries. He said \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d reports had impacted the business.   Jia was placed on an official blacklist of debt defaulters in early December, a move taken by Chinese courts to put pressure on people and entities to repay debts.

          "body": "SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After a year of making threats and weapons advances, North Korea\u2019s leader appears to be using the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in South Korea as a tool to blunt growing international pressure on Pyongyang while leaving his nuclear arsenal untouched.  Kim Jong Un, in his annual New Year\u2019s Day speech, called for reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and flagged the North\u2019s possible participation in the Games next month, just across the border in Pyeongchang.  South Korea has been eager to involve North Korea to ensure the Games are not disrupted by any further nuclear or missile tests and as a way of re-establishing dialogue with the reclusive state.  Analysts say Kim\u2019s gambit is aimed at driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington, which has advocated a strategy of maximum pressure and insisted that all options, including military ones, are on the table.   But the move also targets the broader international consensus involving major players China, Russia and Japan that has tightened sanctions and deepened isolation for North Korea in recent months.  \u201cA major part of the Kim family playbook is to exploit and to widen the divergences in the interests, in the first instance between the U.S. and South Korea, but more broadly among the five major neighbors,\u201d said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until last April and now at the Asia Society Policy Institute.  North Korea has long followed such a strategy of intense provocations followed by conciliatory phases aimed at exposing rifts, he said.  \u201cThis is a classic united we stand, divided we fall situation,\u201d Russel said. \u201cIt\u2019s always easier to maintain five party solidarity when North Korea is behaving badly.\u201d  U.S. President Donald Trump has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea as it seeks to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.  On Tuesday, Trump said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea but he withheld judgment on Pyongyang\u2019s offer to talk.  \u201cRocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time,\u201d Trump wrote in a Twitter post, using his nickname for Kim. \u201cPerhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!\u201d  Washington says the full cooperation of China, Russia and other countries is vital to the success of this effort, which includes significant restrictions on trade and other ties with North Korea.  China, which remains North Korea\u2019s major partner, has curtailed trade in line with United Nations sanctions, but Washington has called for it to do more to isolate Pyongyang.  For a multimedia coverage of North Korea, click www.reuters.com/north-korea/  South Korea\u2019s government publicly welcomed Kim\u2019s overture, and President Moon Jae-in has pushed to ease tensions ahead of the Games by postponing joint military drills with American troops until after the Olympics.  Moon also said on Tuesday the improvement of inter-Korean ties was linked to resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.  The White House has yet to make a detailed response. However, powerful Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the United States would boycott the Games if North Korea attends.  \u201cAllowing Kim Jong Un\u2019s North Korea to participate in Winter Olympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet,\u201d Graham said on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m confident South Korea will reject this absurd overture and fully believe that if North Korea goes to the Winter Olympics, we do not.\u201d  The participation of North Korean athletes and officials in Olympic events may create some awkward moments for international leaders who have spent months painting the country as a pariah state, said Robert Kelly, a professor at South Korea\u2019s Pusan National University.    \u201cIt puts the South Koreans in a weird position because it potentially creates tension between U.S. and Japan who have gone to lengths to isolate the regime,\u201d he said.  Japan\u2019s relationship with South Korea is already seen as under some strain, with one former Japanese diplomat saying Tokyo was suffering from \u201cfatigue\u201d with Seoul and lacking confidence in Moon.   Still, analysts were skeptical Kim\u2019s gambit would do lasting damage to the alliance between Seoul and Washington, or to the international push for sanctions.  \u201cI doubt that there will be a substantial reversal in global economic and political isolation measures in the near term,\u201d said Scott Snyder, director of U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.     At the heart of analysts\u2019 scepticism is Kim\u2019s apparent lack of appetite for compromise on the main points of nuclear weapons, missile testing, or human rights.  \u201cParticipation in things like the Olympics are pseudo-concessions, because the North doesn\u2019t actually have to give up anything,\u201d Kelly said.  In his speech, Kim vowed he would spend 2018 \u201cmass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles\u201d to \u201cgive a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action.\u201d  That means further missile tests are almost certain, with more focus on \u201crealistic\u201d exercises than developmental tests, said Joshua Pollack, a senior researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.  \u201cThe major theme here for strategic forces is shifting from development to serial production, deployment, and increased readiness,\u201d he said.  If the United States wants to take advantage of any possible easing in tensions, it needs to drop its demands for a halt in testing as a precondition for talks, said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project in New York.  \u201cThe most important reciprocal step would be to scale back - not (just) postpone - the spring joint exercises,\u201d he said. \u201cFailure to try these steps will only ensure that unbridled North Korean weapons development continues.\u201d  Reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington and Josh Smith in Seoul; Additional reporting by Linda Sieg in Tokyo and Susan Heavey in Washington; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Alistair Bell"

          "body": "(Reuters) - The government of Curacao said it has scrapped a preliminary agreement with Guangdong Zhenrong Energy to operate the island\u2019s aging Isla refinery, saying the Chinese firm misrepresented itself and was unable to take on such a large endeavor.  The two sides signed a deal in 2016 to invest some $10 billion in upgrading the facility.  Curacao\u2019s government said Guangdong Zhenrong does not have the muscle to invest in the refinery and lacks \u201cunconditional support\u201d from the Chinese government.  \u201cGZE turned out to be the contrary of what it said at the time of signing the MoU (memorandum of understanding),\u201d Curacao said on its government website in a statement dated Sunday.  \u201cCuracao is looking for a viable alternative to guarantee the future of the refinery,\u201d it added.  Guangdong Zhenrong was not immediately available for comment.  Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] has for decades operated the refinery, which opened in 1918, under a lease agreement. But cash-poor PDVSA has been reluctant to invest some $1.5 billion that Curacao authorities requested several years ago to modernize the 335,000 barrel-per-day facility.

          "body": "KHARTOUM, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Sudanese pound\u2019s black market value dropped on Jan. 1, the same day as the country devalued the currency, trading at 28.7 SDG per U.S. dollar compared to 27 the day before, traders said.  Sudan devalued the pound to an official rate of 18 SDG per dollar from 6.7 SDG per dollar, effective from Jan. 1, after the International Monetary Fund urged it in December to float its currency to boost foreign investment.  \u201cThe (U.S.) dollar exchange rate jumped today to 28.7 against the (Sudanese) pound,\u201d a trader on the black market told Reuters, adding that the dollar was epxected to appreciate further.  \u201cThe low exchange rate of the pound and the fluctuation in its price are the real problems that face our economy at the moment,\u201d Finance Minister Mohamed Othman Rukabi told a news conference on Tuesday.  In November the pound had dropped sharply in value after the United States lifted 20 years of economic sanctions, encouraging traders to expand activity, which put pressure on already-scarce foreign currency.  Washington lifted the sanctions and a trade embargo in October, saying Sudan had made progress on counter-terrorism cooperation and in resolving internal conflicts.  Sudan is seeking to increase the supply of foreign currency and decrease demand, central bank governor Hazem Abdul-Kader said.  The import-dependent country has suffered both from the sanctions and from the secession of the south in 2011, when it lost three-quarters of its oil output, its main source of foreign currency.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Roger Federer subdued a feisty Karen Khachanov while Belinda Bencic outlasted Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to help Switzerland beat Russia 3-0 in the Hopman Cup on Tuesday.  Federer won 6-3 7-6(8) as his Australian Open preparation gained momentum but the 19-times grand slam champion was pushed hard in the second set by the 21-year-old in front of a record crowd of 13,943 at the Perth Arena.  Playing with little inhibition and plenty of power, Khachanov broke Federer early on before the Swiss switched gears to march ahead and take the opening set in 29 minutes.  Federer, who beat Khachanov in straight sets at Halle last year in their only previous meeting, showed his experience in the second-set tie breaker that swung back and forth and clinched the contest on his third match point.  \u201cIt was nice to see him free swinging the entire match, which isn\u2019t easy to do,\u201d Federer said of his opponent.  \u201cI remember those days, match point down, you go for it, you don\u2019t care. That is what you have to remind yourselves sometimes when you\u2019re older, to go for it. He mixed up the play well, so it was a tough match for me.  \u201cThe tiebreak was close, it was good to play that early on in the season, to play those nervy situations with the pulse up high, you\u2019re sweating loads. The match had a bit of everything, so I\u2019m very happy with the performance.\u201d  Bencic had a tougher outing against world number 15 Pavlyuchenkova but prevailed 6-1 3-6 6-3 before teaming up with Federer to win the mixed doubles dead rubber.  Earlier, the United States scored a 2-1 win over Japan after Naomi Osaka was too ill to participate. Osaka\u2019s withdrawal gave CoCo Vandeweghe a 6-0 6-0 victory in their singles match.  Japan drew level after Jack Sock retired while trailing against Yuichi Sugita but Osaka\u2019s absence meant the Americans were awarded a 4-0 4-0 win in the deciding mixed doubles rubber.

          "title": "Airbus delivered over 700 jets in 2017, met target: sources",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) delivered over 700 aircraft in 2017, breaking company records and meeting its core industrial target for the year, industry sources said.  Exact figures have been kept under wraps ahead of an  announcement on January 15, but the sources said Airbus handed over a record monthly total of jets in December, surpassing the previous monthly peak of 111 seen in the closing weeks of 2016.  Coming on top of 591 deliveries posted between January and November last year, that implies deliveries of at least 703 aircraft in 2017 as a whole, up at least 2 percent from 2016.  A spokesman for Airbus declined comment.  Airbus stuck throughout 2017 to an official target of more than 700 deliveries for the year, but abandoned a more ambitious informal goal of more than 720 deliveries in October due to continued delays in engine deliveries for the A320neo family.  Airbus officials have said the delays have now eased, following a two-year wrangle with supplier Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) over late engines for the company\u2019s fastest-selling jet.  It is the second year in a row that Airbus has been forced to accelerate sharply in December, with that month\u2019s deliveries accounting for at least 16 percent of the annual total.  Without disclosing numbers, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier thanked staff in a memo for \u201chuge collective efforts\u201d that had seen the company break records for deliveries logged both in one month and in one year, industry sources said.  Still, insiders said the strong industrial performance would be seen by many as a personal coup for Bregier, weeks before he is due to leave the company after losing a bid to succeed Chief Executive Tom Enders, who is himself leaving in 2019.    Airbus is bracing for more internal changes this year as it emerges from a top-level power struggle and rows over the handling of corruption investigations, but ended 2017 with what appears to be a grand slam performance from its current regime.  Besides ending the year on record output, Airbus is also heading for a record December in new business after soon-to-retire sales chief John Leahy announced the firming up of more than 700 orders, equivalent to a year\u2019s production.  Both Leahy and Bregier are leaving Airbus in coming weeks, handing their responsibilities to executives from outside the planemaking inner circle: Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury, who will replace Bregier as head of the planemaking division, and Rolls-Royce (RR.L) civil engines head Eric Schulz, who will replace Leahy after he retires later this month.  Airbus will remain in second place on deliveries in 2017 behind the world\u2019s largest planemaker, Boeing (BA.N), but analysts say the outcome of the order race depends on how many of the new sales make it into the end-year tally of net orders.

          "title": "Gold hits three-month peak after late December rally",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Gold hit its highest since late September on Tuesday, extending a year-end rally that saw the metal rise 4.4 percent in the last three weeks of 2017, as a further retreat in the dollar drove prices above $1,310 an ounce.  Palladium prices meanwhile bounced to a new 17-year high,  within $5 of their all-time peak, as tightening emissions controls and a swing away from diesel cars in Europe fuelled fears of a shortage of the metal after years of market deficit.  Spot gold was up 0.8 percent at $1,312.52 an ounce at 1505 GMT, while U.S. gold futures for February delivery were up $4.90 an ounce at $1,314.20.  The weaker dollar, which posted its biggest annual drop since 2003 last year, helped to lift gold by more than 13 percent in 2017. The metal surged $55 an ounce in the last three weeks of the year alone.   While technical analysts warn that gold\u2019s rally is now looking overstretched, spot prices rose to a peak of $1,313.88 an ounce earlier on Tuesday.   \u201cGold starts 2018 at the highest level since September, and the highest January opening since 2013,\u201d Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said. \u201cIt is only the fourth time ever that gold has opened the year above $1,300.\u201d  \u201cThe key questions for gold in 2018 will be how quickly developed economies can normalise interest rates after more than a decade of monetary largesse; how much further global equity market rallies can extend; what the longer-term impact of the Trump tax reforms will be on corporates and on U.S. government debt levels; and when inflation will finally start to pick up.\u201d  Further dollar weakness could support gold in the near term, he said. The U.S. currency slipped to a four-month low against the euro on Tuesday on optimism over a brightening economic picture in the euro zone, while stocks had a groggy start to the year. [FRX/] [MKTS/GLOB]  Gold has benefited from technical strength over the past two weeks, but the bulk of its rally came during the holiday period with much lower-than-normal average daily volumes, Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, said, adding that the metal is looking overbought.  Among other precious metals, spot silver was up 1.1 percent at $17.13. Spot platinum was 1.2 percent higher at $937.   Palladium was up 2.3 percent at $1,084.95. Earlier it reached $1,090.60, its highest since Jan. 2001, when it peaked at a record $1,095. It was the standout performer among major precious metals last year, rising 56 percent to hit a series of multi-year highs.   \u201cThe fundamentals are strong, it\u2019s true... but this has the mark of a spec squeeze especially given today\u2019s thin trading, right at the start of the year with many market participants still enjoying holidays,\u201d Mitsubishi\u2019s Butler said.

The shells came from an area of Syria controlled by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Anadolu said, adding that there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties after the shells hit a rural area of the border district of Yayladagi.  Last week, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called Syrian President Assad a terrorist and said it was impossible for peace efforts in Syria to continue if he did not leave power.  Turkey has demanded the removal of Assad from power and backed rebels fighting to overthrow him, but it had toned down its rhetoric since it started working with Assad\u2019s allies Russia and Iran for a political resolution.  Turkey now says its main concerns in Syria are combating both Islamist militants and Kurdish YPG militia fighters it considers allies of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) which has fought a decades-long insurgency in southeastern Turkey.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia\u2019s transport safety investigation agency said on Tuesday it plans to raise a seaplane that crashed into a Sydney river on New Year\u2019s Eve, killing six people, including the chief executive of British catering giant Compass Group Plc.  Australian Transport Safety Bureau Executive Director Nat Nagy said investigators would probe several lines of inquiry to piece together what happened, including a close look at the plane\u2019s avionics and maintenance record and the pilot\u2019s background and experience.  It was hoped the plane would be raised by the end of the week, Nagy said. A crane, airbags, or a combination of the two, would be used to raise the plane from the riverbed as gently as possible.  The plane is submerged in 13 meters of water near Cowan, about 40 km (25 miles) north of Sydney.  Nagy said investigators would also look for any other electronic devices, including iPads or iPhones, that may have been on board when the plane crashed on Sunday, killing Compass chief executive Richard Cousins, 58, and four members of his family. The pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, was also killed.  A preliminary report into the crash will be made public in about a month, although authorities have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened.  \u201cIf we do identify any critical safety issues throughout the course of the investigation, we will immediately notify the relevant authorities ... to remedy any issues,\u201d Nagy said.  \u201cThis particular aircraft, I understand was manufactured in 1963, it\u2019s not unusual to have aircraft of that sort of age flying around ... we haven\u2019t seen any systemic issues around this aircraft,\u201d he added.  Australian police have identified those killed with Cousins as Emma Bowden, 48, Heather Bowden, 11, Edward Cousins, 23, and William Cousins, 25.  Family members and media reports identified four of the victims Cousins\u2019 two sons, his fianc\u00e9e and her daughter.  Cousins, who led Compass over the past 11 years, was due to step down in March after being widely credited with turning the company\u2019s business around and making it into one of the Financial Times Stock Exchange\u2019s best-performing firms.   The seaplane was part of the Sydney Seaplanes business that has operated since 2005 with no previous record of mishap.  Seaplane flights have been canceled until further notice.

Major stock indexes closed out 2017 with their best performance since 2013, powered by a combination of strong economic growth, solid corporate earnings, low interest rates and hopes of corporate tax cuts.  \u201cThe first week of trading usually suggests the overall trend of the markets which we expect to be positive,\u201d Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York, wrote in a note.  Oil prices hovered near their mid-2015 highs on Tuesday amid large anti-government rallies in major exporter Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.  Gold and copper prices continued their upward march, but the greenback began the year on the back foot, with the dollar index slipping to its weakest level since September.  \u201cWhile we don\u2019t expect the Iranian unrest to reach a full blown political situation just yet, the protest will add to an already positive uptrend in oil and gold prices,\u201d Cardillo said.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Asian spot LNG prices held above three-year highs on Tuesday as cold temperatures across Japan and continued strong demand from Chinese importers buoyed the market.  Spot prices for February delivery steadied at $11.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).  Japanese utilities have been actively buying cargoes in recent weeks as cold weather sweeping the country has fueled demand for replenishing depleted stocks.  Although long-range forecasts for Japan signal a return to normal for the coming few weeks, temperatures are seen to plunge well below normal in the South Korean capital Seoul which is expected to add to pre-existing demand, traders and analysts said.   China, which surpassed South Korea as the world\u2019s second-biggest LNG importer, continues to attract spot cargoes following rapid consumption growth in 2017 when imports grew 48.4 percent.  China\u2019s rapid shift to gas from coal this year has squeezed domestic grids and led to supply shortages as well as price spikes, prompting the central government to roll back some restrictions on coal use in a bid to ease the gas supply crunch.   On the supply side, Australia\u2019s Wheatstone export facility returned from more than a month-long shutdown with the Asia Excellence tanker currently loading at the port, and two more vessels due at the port in early January.   Exports from the Gorgon plant in western Australia picked up this week after a production unit at the facility likely resumed output on Dec. 25.  Furthermore, Indonesia\u2019s Bontang LNG put 11 cargoes up for sale between February and December via a tender which closes on Jan. 8.   New supplies are also emerging from Russia\u2019s new Yamal LNG project in the Arctic.   The first shipment aboard the Christoph de Margerie arrived at Britain\u2019s Isle of Grain terminal and, in line with long-standing expectations, is currently being re-exported using the Gaselys tanker for onward delivery.   The ice-class tankers carrying volumes from Yamal cannot stray too far from the plant due to rigid shipping schedules and therefore must deposit cargoes at north-west European terminals in winter, where standard vessels can pick them up for delivery to Asia or other premium markets.   The second shipment from Yamal aboard the Boris Vilkitsky dropped off its cargo at the Gate terminal in the Netherlands and has since been re-exported.   PetroChina controlled that cargo.   Commodity traders Vitol, Trafigura and B.B. Energy submitted the most competitive prices in a tender to supply Pakistan with four LNG cargoes in March.  Editing by David Evans"

          "body": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Cash cannot be king for the people of Bakasi camp.  Instead, a small bundle of firewood can be traded for some milk. An unwanted bowl of baby fish is good in exchange for cooking oil. Peanuts are always in high demand.  With little money to hand at the best of times, and struggling to find the goods they need, bartering is key to getting by for Bakasi\u2019s more than 21,000 displaced people.  The eight-year Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria\u2019s northeast has displaced around 2 million people, some in Nigeria and some overseas. The United Nations calls it one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.  More than 670,000 of those people live in camps in Nigeria\u2019s northeast, where cash is hard to come by, opportunities for work are rare and the food and aid they get is often not what they want.  The dusty Bakasi camp sits on the outskirts of the city of Maiduguri in Borno, the spiritual home of the Islamist Boko Haram movement, which wants to establish a caliphate in the region surrounding Lake Chad.  In Bakasi, the displaced frequently swap the little they have for their preferred goods, whether it\u2019s herbs and spices to make soup, groundnut to help a breastfeeding mother produce milk or laundry detergent for a family\u2019s clothes.  \u201cWe don\u2019t get money, that\u2019s why we do this,\u201d said Umaru Usman Kaski, hoping to trade a small bundle of firewood worth about 50 naira (0.12 pounds) to support his family of eight.  While many would prefer money, cash distribution in Nigeria\u2019s northeast is fraught with risk.  Reports of corruption in the humanitarian crisis relief efforts are rife. Those involved, such as government officials, aid workers and soldiers, are alleged to skim from the top before distributing aid.  Many of those responding to the crisis are also concerned that with economic prospects dim for the foreseeable future, millions of people will become dependent on the aid, the vast majority of it coming from overseas.  Until then, Nigeria\u2019s displaced are finding their own ways to balance what they receive with their needs.  Abdulwahal Abdulla, a 50-year-old living in Bakasi for three years, hoped to trade his bowl of young tilapia worth roughly 150 naira for cooking oil.   Abdulla, no fan of the fish, had bought them because products were scarce and it was the only thing he could buy at the time, he said.  Nasiru Buba was trading packets of laundry detergent. He had bought them after working as a porter in the city, pushing a cart loaded with people\u2019s belongings, and wanted to trade them for groundnuts.  \u201cMy wife has just delivered a baby and the breast is not coming out with milk,\u201d said Buba.   \u201cI needed to get groundnuts for her to eat so she will produce sufficient breast milk, and I don\u2019t have any money. When I got the detergent I was not in need of anything, but that changed.\u201d  Reporting by Paul Carsten, eiting by Larry King"

          "body": "MOSS, Norway (Reuters) - Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg began negotiations on Tuesday to add the small Liberal Party to her cabinet, emphasizing jobs creation and energy policy among top priorities for the talks.  Adding the Liberals to her coalition of the Conservatives and the anti-immigration Progress Party may make day-to-day governing easier for Solberg. But the three parties together would hold only 80 seats in Norway\u2019s 169-seat assembly.  Solberg would still need the backing of another small party, the Christian Democrats, who hold eight seats. She had initially tried to form a majority government by including both Liberals and Christian Democrats, but the Christian Democrats have so far rejected the offer.  \u201cNorway\u2019s economy is improving, unemployment is coming down and we have won a competitiveness that it is essential to maintain in the coming years,\u201d Solberg told reporters as the talks started. They are provisionally scheduled to last until Jan. 19.  The comments echoed recent speeches by the prime minister, in which she praised labor unions and employers for agreeing to moderate wage increases that helped keep inflation low and the crown, Norway\u2019s currency, weak against the euro.  While Norway is western Europe\u2019s largest exporter of oil and gas, the country also supports the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to end the fossil fuel era this century.  \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we can come to an agreement on policies that will help us tackle the new challenges our country is facing,\u201d Solberg said, adding that a gradual shift to a greener economy was necessary.  Energy policy may be a stumbling block for the talks, though. The Liberals want to curtail exploration, while the Progress Party and Solberg\u2019s own Conservatives both intend to continue drilling for hydrocarbons.  Solberg narrowly retained power in a September election by promising further tax cuts and economic progress for Norway, which has only partly recovered from a 2015-2016 downturn caused by a plunge in the price of oil.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus delivered over 700 aircraft in 2017, reaching a company record and meeting its core output target for the year, industry sources said.  Exact figures have been kept under wraps ahead of an announcement on January 15, but the sources said Airbus handed over a record monthly total of jets in December, surpassing the previous monthly peak of 111 seen in the closing weeks of 2016.  Coming on top of 591 deliveries posted between January and November last year, that implies deliveries of at least 703 aircraft in 2017 as a whole, up at least 2 percent from 2016.  A spokesman for Airbus declined comment.  Airbus stuck throughout 2017 to an official target of more than 700 deliveries for the year, but abandoned a more ambitious informal goal of more than 720 deliveries in October due to continued delays in engine deliveries for the A320neo family.  Airbus officials have said the delays have now eased, following a two-year wrangle with supplier Pratt & Whitney over late engines for the company\u2019s fastest-selling jet.

In a memo to staff on Tuesday, Theodor Weimer said: \u201cMay it be for our house - Deutsche Boerse - a good year after a turbulent 2017. I\u2019m confident that we as a team will achieve this.\u201d  Weimer\u2019s comments are the first to staff after the former head of UniCredit\u2019s business in Germany took the helm on Monday.

It hopes to profit from Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union by capturing a portion of the lucrative euro clearing market that is currently centered in London.

          "body": "* Dec PMI indices show continuing strong economic growth  * Zloty is strongest against euro since August 2015  * Industrial output powers ahead, labour shortage may fuel CPI (Adds further currency rise, new comments)  By Sandor Peto and Bartosz Chmielewski  BUDAPEST/WARSAW, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Central European currencies jumped on Tuesday, buoyed by strong Czech, Hungarian and Polish manufacturing surveys that  indicated the region\u2019s economies were continuing to power ahead.  Hungary\u2019s Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) was the highest ever recorded for the month of December, coming in at 60.  The Czech and Polish PMIs, at 59.8 and 55 respectively, were also well above the 50 mark which separates economic expansion from contraction, and beat analysts\u2019 forecasts.  The Hungarian forint firmed half a percent against the euro to two-month highs at 308.6 by 1400 GMT. The zloty gained 0.3 percent and the Czech crown 0.2 percent.  The crown and the forint set multi-week highs, and the zloty reached its strongest level since August 2015, at 4.1605  Polish manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in 34 months.  ING senior economist Piotr Poplawski said the figures suggested that fourth-quarter annual economic growth was above 5 percent.  \u201cHowever, the effect (on the zloty) may be short-lived, given the moderate chance that the data would encourage the NBP (Polish central bank) to hike rates,\u201d he said.  \u201cClearly, the dollar\u2019s weakness translates into higher flows into our region, supporting the euro as well as us,\u201d he added.  The zloty set a 3-year high against the dollar at 3.4483.  Trade was slow in the region as several markets, including the Polish stock exchange, stayed closed after the long New Year weekend.  The regional PMI data indicated robust demand from abroad and at home, fuelled by a fast rise in wages due to a region-wide labour shortage, after millions of workers moved to richer Western European countries.  \u201cIt is still a fact that manufacturers have a difficult time with finding workers, which can hinder further growth,\u201d Komercni Banka analyst Viktor Zeisel said in a note.  Economic output figures may raise questions later this year about a possible rise in inflation pressures related to the labour shortage, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.  \u201cEconomic overheating, that is not a question right now, at least not yet,\u201d the trader said.  Hungarian government bonds were little changed on Tuesday.  Long-term yields may drop further from current near-record-lows when the National Bank of Hungary launches long-term interest rate swap auctions later this month.  The facility and a scheme to buy mortgage notes are aimed at boosting mortgage lending at low fixed interest rates.  The Hungarian central bank has not showed any sign of worrying about inflation, which remains well within its target range, or a trend towards higher bond yields in core developed markets.

          "body": "OTTAWA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The pace of growth in the Canadian manufacturing sector picked up at the end of last year as companies boosted their operating capacity amid an increase in backlogs of work and new orders, data showed on Tuesday.  The Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.7 in December from 54.4 the previous month. A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.   The measure of output rose to 54.1 from 53.7, while new orders increased to 54.6 from 53.9. Companies said the increased demand was partly due to spending in the energy sector, which is recovering from the oil price crash more than two years ago.  New orders for exports also saw modest growth, rising to 50.6 from 49.4, with manufacturers pointing to improving global economic conditions.  Meanwhile, backlogs of work continued to grow, with the index at a nearly three-and-a-half-year high of 52.4 from November\u2019s 51.8.   Manufacturers were somewhat upbeat about the year ahead with 36 percent of those surveyed expecting output volumes to rise in 2018, compared to 7 percent who anticipate a decline.

          "body": "KIEV (Reuters) - Moldovan President Igor Dodon on Tuesday rejected a decision by the country\u2019s constitutional court to suspend his powers temporarily due to a wrangle between him and the pro-Western government over ministerial appointments.   Dodon had earlier blocked the government\u2019s choice of new ministers in a reshuffle, accusing the nominees of incompetence and saying some had links to a notorious scandal in which around $1 billion was siphoned out of the banking system.  In retaliation, the ruling coalition appealed to the constitutional court to suspend Dodon\u2019s powers so that the government could push through its choice of ministers.    The Moscow-backed Dodon has frequently locked horns with the Chisinau government, especially during a series of spats between Moldova and Russia in 2017 that culminated in Moldova recalling its ambassador to Moscow in December.  \u201cThe court once again confirmed its image of an obedient political instrument, not a constitutional body. This is a shameful and regrettable fall for a state that claims to be democratic,\u201d Dodon said in a Facebook post.  \u201cAs for my position, I decided not to give in. It\u2019s better that than to spend years explaining why some or other of the compromised ministers were appointed to the post.\u201d  Reporting by Matthias Williams and Pavel Polityuk; editing by Mark Heinrich"

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - The light-grey suit and matching tie that North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un donned for his New Year\u2019s address was likely carefully calculated to project a softer, more relaxed image to go with his surprise offer for talks with Seoul.  Departing from his usual black or navy suits, Kim gave his televised speech wearing black-rimmed glasses and slicked back hair, speaking fluently and rarely looking down to read as he raised the possibility of sending a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea.   \u201cIn this New Year\u2019s address, North Korea seems to have taken great pains with the image portrayed by Kim Jong Un,\u201d said an analysis by the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification after Kim\u2019s speech.   \u201cThe change from the previous dark Maoist suits to a softer toned grey Western-style suit likely aimed to underpin peace, which Kim stressed in his address,\u201d the institute said.   It added that Kim\u2019s style \u201creflected a relaxed state of mind\u201d that likely resulted from his previous announcement that North Korea had achieved its nuclear ambitions.  After a year dominated by fiery rhetoric and escalating tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, Kim declared Monday that his country was \u201ca peace-loving and responsible nuclear power\u201d and called for lowering military tensions and improving ties with the South.  Kim also said he was open to dialogue with Seoul, prompting South Korea on Tuesday to propose high-level talks between the two countries on Jan. 9 at the border truce village of Panmunjeom.  Analysts said the North Korean leader\u2019s speech on Monday showed more confidence compared to previous years, his old habit of swaying from side to side while making speeches nearly undetectable. In his first New Year\u2019s address as North Korea\u2019s leader in 2013, Kim frequently sounded short of breath, his voice wavering from time to time.  Kim made his maiden public address in April 15, 2012 at a parade marking the centenary of his grandfather\u2019s birth. This year, there was none of the uneasiness that marked that speech and his subsequent public addresses.  His voice, his hair shaved on the side, as well as his light-colored Western-style suit and glasses, were also reminiscent of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, according to defectors and analysts. Kim Il Sung had a more gregarious and popular image than Kim Jong Un\u2019s reclusive father, Kim Jong Il.  Kim Jong Un has embraced New Year addresses as a chance to outline his policies and rally the North Korean people. Last year, he used his speech to declare that North Korea was in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of perfecting an intercontinental ballistic missile.   Kim Gun-hee, a consultant on image making and leadership, said the grey suit may have been designed to deflect some of the negative global attention Kim\u2019s nuclear and missile tests have prompted.  \u201cWhen we advise clients who are in tough situations or are surrounded by unfavourable rumours, we tell them to wear either white or grey,\u201d she said.  \u201cIn the study of color psychology, white imbues innocence while grey tends to take attention away from you. Kim may have felt some pressure from being at the centre of global focus and turned to grey after sticking to dark tones for several years.\u201d  Reporting by Christine Kim, additional reporting by Hyonhee Shin,; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Lincoln Feast"

In a memo to staff on Tuesday, Theodor Weimer said: \u201cMay it be for our house - Deutsche Boerse - a good year after a turbulent 2017. I\u2019m confident that we as a team will achieve this.\u201d  Weimer\u2019s comments are the first to staff after the former head of UniCredit\u2019s business in Germany took the helm on Monday.   He succeeded Carsten Kengeter, who resigned last year amid an investigation into alleged insider trading that had its roots in the failed merger with the London Stock Exchange. Kengeter denied any wrongdoing.  \u201cWe have everything that we need: a one-of-a-kind business model, technology that is valued by others, and a motivated and superbly educated team - to the extent I\u2019ve been able to experience it so far,\u201d Weimer wrote in the memo seen by Reuters.  The changing of the guard comes at an important moment for Deutsche Boerse. It hopes to profit from Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union by capturing a portion of the lucrative euro clearing market that is currently centered in London.   Weimer said he would hold a town hall meeting with staff in January. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that this office that is being transferred to me requires a blend of leadership and instinct, a mix of giving direction and active listening,\u201d he said.

          "body": "SOFIA (Reuters) - President Rumen Radev on Tuesday vetoed anti-graft legislation passed by Bulgaria\u2019s parliament, saying the bill failed to offer the means to effectively investigate corruption networks.  Radev acted only a day after Bulgaria, the European Union\u2019s poorest country, assumed the six-month, rotating presidency of the bloc for the first time since it joined the EU in 2007.  Bulgaria has made scant progress towards stamping out graft and organized crime, and the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive, has repeatedly rebuked the Black Sea country for failing to prosecute and sentence allegedly corrupt officials.  According to Transparency International, Bulgaria is the EU\u2019s most corrupt country.   The legislation, approved by parliament on Dec. 20, entailed the creation of a special anti-graft unit meant to investigate persons occupying high public office as well as assets and conflicts of interest.  But analysts said the unit\u2019s objectivity could be limited by the fact its management would be appointed by parliament under the legislation, and it therefore might not be truly independent and could by used by those in power to persecute opponents.  \u201cI believe that the adopted law not only does not create an adequate legal basis for tackling corruption but will even make it difficult to fight it,\u201d Radev, who was elected in November 2016, said in a statement.  \u201cNo doubt, the president has strong arguments (to veto the law),\u201d political analyst Petar Cholakov said.  Some analysts, however, expect parliament to overturn Radev\u2019s veto.  Kornelia Ninova, leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, endorsed Radev\u2019s veto saying it gave \u201ca golden chance\u201d for the government and its majority in parliament to produce effective anti-corruption legislation.  \u201cIf we do not tackle corruption, we cannot solve any of the other problems - poverty, health, education, demography,\u201d Ninova said. Officials from the ruling center-right coalition had no immediate comment on Radev\u2019s move.  The new law also focuses on improving control and accountability of law-enforcement agencies, and the government in Sofia is hoping Bulgaria will be able to change opinions and remove its tarnished image during its EU presidency.  Corruption has deterred foreign investment since communism collapsed in Bulgaria in 1989, and the EU has kept Sofia as well as neighboring Romania - for the same rule-of-law failings - outside its Schengen zone of passport-free travel.

          "body": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi state minister Ibrahim al-Assaf was seen attending a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, according to a photograph published on official media, almost two months after the veteran official was reported detained in a crackdown on corruption.  There was no immediate comment from Saudi officials, but a Saudi source familiar with the matter said Assaf retained his positions as minister of state and adviser to the king.   Assaf, who was also a former finance minister and a board member of national oil giant Saudi Aramco, was among people detained and under investigation by a new anti-corruption body in November, a senior Saudi official had told Reuters.  He was released from the Ritz last month after being cleared of wrongdoing and without making any payment to the state, the source said. Local media also reported his release.  Saudi security forces rounded up about 200 princes, ministers and business leaders and converted the Ritz-Carlton into a luxurious prison for them in early November in what Riyadh said was a crackdown on corruption.   The move was also widely seen by analysts as helping Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman consolidate his grip on power, after he ousted his cousin as heir to the throne in the summer.  The most powerful of King Abdullah\u2019s sons, former National Guard chief Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, was released last month after agreeing to pay the government $1 billion.   Prince Miteb had been the last member of Abdullah\u2019s Shammar branch of the family to retain a key position in the Saudi power structure, after Prince Meshaal and Prince Turki were relieved of their posts as governors in 2015.  Assaf had been accused of embezzlement related to the expansion of Mecca\u2019s Grand Mosque and taking advantage of his position and inside information to purchase lands, according to a Saudi official.   Several detainees have been freed after agreeing to settlements in which they hand over assets to the state.  Saudi authorities see the settlements not as blackmail but as an obligation to reimburse money taken illegally from the world\u2019s top oil producer over several decades.

          "body": "GENEVA (Reuters) - United Nations human rights experts called on Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to end \u201crepression\u201d of rights activists and release dozens detained since September for peacefully exercising their civil and political rights.  More than 60 prominent clerics, writers, journalists, academics and activists are reported to have been detained in a wave of arrests since September, they said in a joint statement.   The crackdown on dissent has been denounced by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, but strong criticism by the U.N. of the oil giant is rare.  There was no immediate reaction from the Saudi government. Riyadh says it does not have political prisoners, but senior officials have said monitoring of activists is needed to maintain social stability.  \u201cWe are witnessing the persecution of human rights defenders for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, assembly, association and belief, as well as in retaliation for their work,\u201d the five independent experts said.  They decried a \u201cworrying pattern of widespread and systematic arbitrary arrests and detention\u201d through the kingdom\u2019s use of counter-terrorism and security-related laws.  Prominent Islamist preacher Salman al-Awdah, whom the U.N. experts described as a \u201creformist\u201d and an influential religious figure who has urged greater respect for human rights within Sharia, is among those held, they said.  They also named academic and writer Abdullah al-Maliki, entrepreneur Essam al-Zamel, and Abdulaziz Al Shubaily and Issa bin Hamid al-Hamid of the banned Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association as detainees.  \u201cDespite being elected as member of the Human Rights Council at the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia has continued its practice of silencing, arbitrarily arresting, detaining and persecuting human rights defenders and critics,\u201d the experts said.  The U.N. investigators have global mandates on arbitrary detention, human rights defenders, the right to freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of religion or belief, and protection of human rights while countering terrorism.  The statement did not mention the arrests in November of some 200 princes, ministers and business leaders who were then held in the luxurious Ritz-Carlton hotel in what Riyadh said was a crackdown on corruption.

          "title": "Iran's leader blames enemies for deadly unrest, U.S. calls that 'nonsense'",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iran\u2019s supreme leader accused the country\u2019s enemies on Tuesday of being behind days of street unrest, as the death toll from anti-government demonstrations rose to 21.  Riot police were out in force in several cities on the sixth day of protests, which spread to the northwestern city of Tabriz, according to social media posts, as security forces scrambled to contain the boldest challenge to Iran\u2019s leadership since 2009.  More than 450 protesters have been arrested in the capital in the last three days, Tehran\u2019s deputy provincial governor said, and hundreds of others were detained around the country. A judicial official said some could face the death penalty.  In the southwestern city of Ahvaz, police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators.  \u201cPolice shot tear gas and later went around asking shops on two main streets to close, to completely clear the area,\u201d a resident told Reuters by telephone.  Nine people were killed in Isfahan province during protests on Monday night, including two members of the security forces, state TV said. Six protesters were killed during an attack on a police station in the town of Qahderijan in that province. The local governor said the protesters were armed.    Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Iran\u2019s foes of fomenting the unrest, which began as protests about economic hardship and corruption but have grown into political rallies, some of which have criticized him by name.  \u201cIn recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic,\u201d he said, in his first reaction to the unrest.   He did not name the enemies but Ali\u00a0Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia were behind the riots.   \u201cSaudis will receive Iran\u2019s unexpected response and they know how serious it can be,\u201d Shamkhani was quoted by Tasnim news as saying in an interview with Beirut-based\u00a0Al Mayadeen TV.      Khamenei said on his website that he would address the nation about the events \u201cwhen the time is right\u201d.  The United States rejected the suggestion that the protests were the work of foreign powers.  \u201cWe all know that\u2019s complete nonsense,\u201d said Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.   \u201cThe demonstrations are completely spontaneous. They are virtually in every city in Iran. This is the precise picture of a long oppressed people rising up against their dictators.\u201d   Washington will seek emergency sessions at the United Nations to express support for the protesters, Haley said, adding that the international community had failed to support reformist protests in 2009 that were crushed by Tehran.  \u201cWe must not make that mistake again,\u201d she said.  The U.S. State Department urged Tehran to restore access to any social media sites that had been restricted and urged Iranian security forces to exercise restraint.  A U.S. official told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that U.S. intelligence officials think the protests have little chance of toppling the government.  Responding to President Donald Trump\u2019s daily tweets praising the protesters, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iranians enjoyed the right to peaceful protest that was denied to citizens of U.S. allies in the Middle East.  \u201cThese hard-earned rights will be protected, and infiltrators will not be allowed to sabotage them through violence and destruction,\u201d Zarif tweeted.  French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said a planned trip by Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to Tehran this week had been postponed. Macron also told Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a telephone call that Tehran must respect Iranians\u2019 right to free speech and to protest.  Russia, which is allied with Iran in its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said \u201cunacceptable\u201d external interference was destabilizing the situation in Iran, the RIA news agency reported.   Turkey, which, along with the United States and Saudi Arabia, supports Syrian rebel groups, called for restraint.  \u201cWe believe it is necessary to avoid violence and not succumb to provocations,\u201d the Turkish Foreign Ministry said, adding that it hoped foreign intervention would be avoided.      Earlier on Tuesday, Trump had tweeted: \u201cThe people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime ... The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!\u201d  The head of Tehran\u2019s Revolutionary Court, Musa Ghazanfarabadi, said protesters would be tried soon and the ringleaders could be charged with \u201cmoharebeh\u201d \u2014 an Islamic term meaning warring against God \u2014 which carries the death penalty.   Deputy Interior Minister Hossein Zolfaghari said 90 percent of the detainees were under 25, showing the younger generation\u2019s frustration at economic hardships and lack of social freedoms.  Iran is an OPEC oil producer and regional power deeply involved in Syria and Iraq as part of a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia, foreign interventions resented by many Iranians who want their leaders to pour more resources into cutting youth unemployment, which reached 29 percent last year.  President Rouhani, seen as a pragmatist who is at odds with hardliners, deflected criticisms of his economic record.  \u201cPeople on the streets do not ask for bread and water, but for more freedom,\u201d he said in televised comments on Monday, implying that the protesters were not targeting his government but the more rigid clerical establishment.        Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said both protesters and the security forces should follow the law.  \u201cEven those who are confronting the rioters should act within the framework of law,\u201d he told a news conference.  State television reported that protesters who set ablaze four mosques in villages in Savadkuh County in northern Iran on Monday had been arrested.

The Dubai index had a poor 2017, falling 4.6 percent, but it rose 1.2 percent on Tuesday as stocks in the blue-chip Emaar group, which were beaten down last year by the slump in Dubai\u2019s real estate market, surged in particular.  Flagship Emaar Properties, which had been trading near 12-month lows, climbed 3.6 percent in modest trading volume. Emaar Development, which had sunk from November\u2019s initial public offer price of 6.03 dirhams to a record low of 5.02 dirhams, rebounded 3.9 percent to 5.29 dirhams, while Emaar Malls added 2.8 percent.  \u201cThe recent sell-off in the UAE markets has brought up some interesting value buying opportunities,\u201d Dubai\u2019s Al Mal Capital said in a weekly report.  \u201cDecember has seen high quality companies like Emaar and Aramex retreat more than 10 percent, each of them for their own specific reason. As we move to the New Year, we believe that investors will take a fresh look at the market and re-value these companies,\u201d it said. Aramex edged down 0.2 percent on Tuesday.  A Reuters poll of leading Middle East fund managers, published on Sunday, found 54 percent expect to raise their allocations to regional equities over the next three months and none expects to reduce them, the most positive balance since August.  Gulf Navigation sank 3.9 percent after its board decided to raise issued and paid-up capital by 448.3 million dirhams ($122.2 million) to 1 billion dirhams through a rights issue of new shares.  Abu Dhabi\u2019s index gained 1.0 percent on the back of banks, with First Abu Dhabi adding 2.0 percent, while Qatar climbed 1.1 percent as Masraf Al Rayan, the most heavily traded stock, surged 2.4 percent.  But Saudi Arabia fell 0.3 percent; it had dropped 0.5 percent on Monday after the government raised domestic gasoline prices. Riyadh was the only major regional market to trade on Monday.  Medical insurer Bupa Arabia climbed 2.1 percent after signing a services deal with national oil firm Saudi Aramco.  Kuwait\u2019s general index, which contains many second-tier and speculative stocks, dropped 1.5 percent, but the Kuwait 15 index of blue chips slipped only 0.3 percent.  * The index fell 0.3 percent to 7,172 points.  * The index rose 1.2 percent to 3,411 points.  * The index gained 1.0 percent to 4,442 points.  * The index climbed 1.1 percent to 8,620 points.  * The index edged up 0.1 percent to 15,035 points.  * The index dropped 1.5 percent to 6,313 points.  * The index fell 0.7 percent to 1,322 points.  * The index rose 0.2 percent to 5,094 points.

The rent-to-own furniture retailer has been under pressure from activist hedge funds Engaged Capital and Marcato Capital to sell itself.

Ivory Coast\u2019s cocoa season started on Oct. 1. The country is currently in the dry season, which runs from mid-November to March.

Major stock indexes closed out 2017 with their best performance since 2013, powered by a combination of strong economic growth, solid corporate earnings, low interest rates and hopes of corporate tax cuts.  \u201cThe first week of trading usually suggests the overall trend of the markets which we expect to be positive,\u201d Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York, wrote in a note.

          "body": "SINGAPORE/BERLIN (Reuters) - A Vietnamese tycoon detained in Singapore is seeking passage to Germany to avoid being sent back home where he could face the death penalty, his lawyers said on Tuesday.  Phan Van Anh Vu, 42, who media say is wanted in Vietnam for revealing state secrets, was detained in Singapore on Thursday as he tried to leave for Malaysia, said Remy Choo, one of at least three lawyers engaged by Vu\u2019s family to represent him.  Vu\u2019s lawyer in Germany said that he was a senior officer in Vietnam\u2019s secret police as well as a property developer.  His case adds a new international dimension to a Vietnamese corruption crackdown that has brought the arrest of dozens of officials and business figures and is entangled with political intrigues in the single-party communist state.  One of Vu\u2019s lawyers said his rank in the secret service meant he could give details of an operation in which Germany says a Vietnamese oil executive was kidnapped in a Berlin park last summer and bundled home to face trial.  Vietnamese media quoted police as saying Vu was wanted for revealing state secrets. They did not say what these related to or whether that was linked to his role as a property developer.  German lawyer Victor Pfaff, told Reuters that as a senior employee in Vietnam\u2019s secret police Vu would have known about the disappearance of Trinh Xuan Thanh from Berlin. He is facing corruption-related charges in Vietnam and potentially the death penalty.  Pfaff said it was \u201ca matter of life and death\u201d for Vu as well and he had filed an application to German authorities to allow the embassy in Singapore issue him a visa allowing him to travel to Germany.  \u201cI have made an application for Germany to accept him,\u201d said Pfaff, adding that this was not an asylum application but rather made use of rules that allow a foreign national to enter the country \u201cto protect German interests\u201d.  It is not possible to apply for asylum from abroad.       Germany\u2019s foreign office declined to comment.   Singapore has no extradition treaty with Vietnam, but its immigration authority has the power to repatriate people under certain circumstances, according to the city-state\u2019s Immigration Act.   \u201cMy client\u2019s family is concerned there is an imminent risk of repatriation to Vietnam,\u201d said Choo.  Choo and another lawyer in Singapore, Foo Chow Ming, said they had been unable to contact Vu, and on Tuesday filed an application in Singapore\u2019s High Court to try to gain access to their client.  Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Public Security said last month it was seeking the arrest of Vu, a developer in the communist state\u2019s central city of Danang, where the local leadership was shaken up after corruption accusations last year.  A spokesperson for Singapore\u2019s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said Vu was arrested on Dec. 28 \u201cfor committing offences under the Immigration Act\u201d.  Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Vu\u2019s detention in Singapore and whether Hanoi had sought his extradition.  Serious security offences, such as revealing state secrets, can carry the death penalty in Vietnam. Singapore also has the death penalty for some crimes.  Singapore has close diplomatic and trade ties to Vietnam. This year, Singapore is also chairing the regional Association of Southeast Asian Nations grouping, which has sought to strengthen regional cooperation.  Dozens of Vietnamese officials and business figures have been arrested in a crackdown on corruption that has gathered pace since the security establishment gained greater sway in the ruling Communist Party in 2016.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Television host Hoda Kotb was named the new co-anchor of the NBC News \u201cToday\u201d show on Tuesday, replacing former co-host Matt Lauer several weeks after the longtime anchor was fired for inappropriate sexual behavior, according to a network statement.   Kotb will join Savannah Guthrie during the first two hours of the popular program, starting at 7 a.m. EST (noon GMT), and become the first pair of women to host the show along with weatherman Al Roker and Orange Room host Carson Daly. Kotb will continue co-hosting the 10 a.m. hour of \u201cToday\u201d with Kathie Lee Gifford.  \u201cIt\u2019s 2018 and we are kicking off the year right because Hoda is officially the co-anchor of Today,\u201d said Guthrie, 46, who announced the news during the program\u2019s opening moments.   Kotb, 53, quickly filled in as co-host when Lauer was fired on Nov. 28 after a female colleague complained to NBC officials about a pattern of inappropriate sexual behavior that began while they were on assignment at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia, according to the network.   At least two other women went to NBC with similar complaints against Lauer following the first allegation. None of the women has been publicly identified.  \u201cRepairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I\u2019m committed to beginning that effort,\u201d Lauer said after he was fired.  Reuters has not independently verified the accusations.   Kotb joined NBC News in 1998 as a correspondent and has co-hosted the fourth hour of \u201cToday\u201d with Gifford since 2008. She also hosts a program on Sirius XM satellite radio.  \u201cOver the past several weeks, Hoda has seamlessly stepped into the co-anchor role alongside Savannah, and the two have quickly hit the ground running,\u201d NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said in an email to staff, according to Today.com.  #SavannahHodaTODAY was a top-trending topic on Twitter following the announcement as fans and NBC News colleagues congratulated the host on her new position.

          "body": "* Finnish retailer plans sale of $120 million property  * Booming market for commercial property in Helsinki  * Shares rise 8 pct  * Stockmann could cut profit outlook again - analyst (Adds profit outlook, bullets, updates shares)  HELSINKI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Department store chain Stockmann plans to sell a well-known Helsinki building to cash in on the Finnish capital\u2019s booming commercial property market and bolster its finances.  A sale of the \u201cBook House\u201d in the heart of Helsinki, together with a long-planned property sale in St Petersburg, would help the indebted company which posted a core quarterly loss for the third quarter.  \u201cValues in Helsinki are record high at the moment, and as we don\u2019t practise retail business in this property any longer, we will start investigating a possible divestment,\u201d said Bjorn Teir, director for real estate at Stockmann.  Teir did not give a book value for the Book House, designed by architect Alvar Aalto and built in 1969. Analyst Sauli Vilen from research firm Inderes gave a rough estimate of around 100 million euros ($120 million).  Stockmann used to sell books there itself but sold that business to Sweden\u2019s Bonnier in 2015.  Shares in Stockmann, which fell about 40 percent last year, were up 7.7 percent at 4.685 euros by 1325 GMT.  The company has struggled in recent years due to economic slowdowns in Finland and Russia as well as the rise on online shopping. Its interest-bearing liabilities at the end of September were 843 million euros, or about 95 percent of equity.  Stockmann has been negotiating with investment company O1 Group over the sale of its St Petersburg department store property, which has a book value of 181 million euros. That process continues, it added.  In November, the company put its real estate assets including the Book House forward as collateral for a new refinancing package.  The total fair value of its real estate assets is 950 million euros, the majority of which is estimated to be made up of the company\u2019s Helsinki flagship department store.  Stockmann cut its profit outlook in September and Vilen said it could do so again ahead of its 2017 results due on Feb. 14.  The company has forecast full-year comparable core operating profit to be in line or slightly down from 2016. In the first nine months of the year, the loss widened to 12 million euros from 4 million a year earlier.  \u201cThe fact that no new warning has been given yet means their Christmas sales have been rather good. But Stockmann was far from the guidance after nine months so a mild warning is still likely,\u201d said Vilen, who has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock.  $1 = 0.8309 euros\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl; Editing by Keith Weir and Mark\nPotter"

          "title": "Gold hits three-month peak after late December rally",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Gold hit its highest since late September on Tuesday, extending a year-end rally that saw the metal rise 4.4 percent in the last three weeks of 2017, as a further retreat in the dollar drove prices above $1,310 an ounce.  Palladium prices meanwhile bounced to a new 17-year high,  within $5 of their all-time peak, as tightening emissions controls and a swing away from diesel cars in Europe fuelled fears of a shortage of the metal after years of market deficit.  Spot gold was up 0.8 percent at $1,312.52 an ounce at 1505 GMT, while U.S. gold futures for February delivery were up $4.90 an ounce at $1,314.20.  The weaker dollar, which posted its biggest annual drop since 2003 last year, helped to lift gold by more than 13 percent in 2017. The metal surged $55 an ounce in the last three weeks of the year alone.   While technical analysts warn that gold\u2019s rally is now looking overstretched, spot prices rose to a peak of $1,313.88 an ounce earlier on Tuesday.   \u201cGold starts 2018 at the highest level since September, and the highest January opening since 2013,\u201d Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said. \u201cIt is only the fourth time ever that gold has opened the year above $1,300.\u201d  \u201cThe key questions for gold in 2018 will be how quickly developed economies can normalise interest rates after more than a decade of monetary largesse; how much further global equity market rallies can extend; what the longer-term impact of the Trump tax reforms will be on corporates and on U.S. government debt levels; and when inflation will finally start to pick up.\u201d  Further dollar weakness could support gold in the near term, he said. The U.S. currency slipped to a four-month low against the euro on Tuesday on optimism over a brightening economic picture in the euro zone, while stocks had a groggy start to the year. [FRX/] [MKTS/GLOB]  Gold has benefited from technical strength over the past two weeks, but the bulk of its rally came during the holiday period with much lower-than-normal average daily volumes, Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, said, adding that the metal is looking overbought.  Among other precious metals, spot silver was up 1.1 percent at $17.13. Spot platinum was 1.2 percent higher at $937.   Palladium was up 2.3 percent at $1,084.95. Earlier it reached $1,090.60, its highest since Jan. 2001, when it peaked at a record $1,095. It was the standout performer among major precious metals last year, rising 56 percent to hit a series of multi-year highs.   \u201cThe fundamentals are strong, it\u2019s true... but this has the mark of a spec squeeze especially given today\u2019s thin trading, right at the start of the year with many market participants still enjoying holidays,\u201d Mitsubishi\u2019s Butler said.

          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - After a year that saw democracy advocates in Hong Kong jailed and ousted from public office, thousands marched through the streets of Hong Kong on New Year\u2019s Day to warn China not to meddle further in the city\u2019s affairs and undermine its autonomy.  Over the past year, Hong Kong, a former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, has experienced what critics and pro-democracy activists describe as an intensifying assault on its autonomy by China\u2019s Communist Party leaders.  This is despite Beijing\u2019s promises to grant the city wide-ranging freedoms including an independent judiciary, under a so-called \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework.  Besides the controversial jailing of several prominent young activists for unlawful assembly over the massive 2014 \u201cOccupy\u201d pro-democracy protests, authorities also ejected six pro-democracy lawmakers from the legislature for failing to take proper oaths of office.  The city\u2019s reputation as one of Asia\u2019s most robust legal jurisdictions has also come under a cloud amidst accusations of a politicization of certain legal cases.   The protesters, who included many middle-aged and elderly citizens, held up banners and chanted the march\u2019s main theme to \u201cProtect Hong Kong\u201d during a walk of several kilometers to the city\u2019s government headquarters.   Others decried an unprecedented move by China\u2019s parliament last week that said part of a high-speed railway station being built in Hong Kong would be regarded as mainland territory governed by mainland laws.  \u201cWe are here to tell the government that we will not give up,\u201d said Joshua Wong, one of the democracy activists jailed last year, but who is now out on bail pending an appeal.  \u201cWe have encountered many difficulties last year, including some of us being sued and jailed, but we will stand with Hong Kong people. We will fight for the rule of law, fight for Hong Kong, fight for the future, fight for the next generations.\u201d  Two protesters who dressed up as People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers said they were concerned about the reach of China\u2019s security apparatus. Others called for full democracy as the only lasting means to safeguard the city\u2019s way of life.   The organizers of the march said some 10,000 people had showed up. Police, however, put the figure at 6,200.  The demonstration was largely peaceful, though some protesters who tried to later gather in a forecourt of the government\u2019s headquarters skirmished briefly with security guards.  The so-called \u201cCivic Square\u201d was where the 2014 pro-democracy protests first kicked off when a group of protesters stormed over a fence and faced off with local police.  Despite the defiance on show, some said they feared Hong Kong would continue to be squeezed by Beijing.  \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing what they can,\u201d said Andy Lau who was among the marchers. \u201cIf we have the right to demonstrate then we should. But I\u2019m not feeling positive. I think things will get worse.\u201d   The Hong Kong government, in a statement, said it \u201cfully respects the right of Hong Kong people to take part in processions and their freedom of expression\u201d.  China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping has said that while Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy under \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, Beijing still holds supreme authority over the city and won\u2019t tolerate any challenge to its authority.

          "body": "OFER PRISON, West Bank (Reuters) - A 16-year-old Palestinian girl who slapped an Israeli officer two weeks ago will face assault charges in an Israeli military court, prosecutors said on Thursday.  The Dec. 15 incident in the occupied West Bank was captured on video and posted on the Internet, drawing attention on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide.  Palestinians hailed the teenager, Ahed Tamimi, as a hero. Israelis debated whether the officer, who along with another soldier was also kicked by her, had done the right thing by opting not to strike back.  The incident occurred at the entrance to Tamimi\u2019s family home in Nabi Saleh, a village in the West Bank, during what the army said was stone-throwing at soldiers. Weekly protests against Israeli settlement policy have been held there for years.  The military said in a statement that the officer \u201cacted professionally\u201d but right-wing Israeli politicians described his behavior as humiliating.  Three days after a video clip of the confrontation was broadcast on Israeli television, Tamimi - who can be heard on the video clip shouting at the soldiers to leave - was arrested.   At Thursday\u2019s hearing, in a military courtroom in Ofer prison near the Palestinian city of Ramallah, prosecutors said they intended to indict the teenager on charges that include aggravated assault and insulting a soldier.  Prosecutors asked the court to extend her detention for several days to give them time to prepare the charge sheet.  Tamimi made news two years ago when she was pictured biting a soldier who tried to arrest her younger brother.  Writing by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Andrew Bolton"

The protest came a day after celebrations by Dalits in Pune, 150 km (95 miles) from Mumbai, of the 200th anniversary of a battle they won, fighting alongside British colonial forces, against an upper caste ruler, were marred by clashes with right-wing Hindu groups.  Those clashes resulted in the death of a 28-year-old man, according to the Maharashtra state government. It was not immediately clear which side the man was on.  Tuesday, Dalit protesters threw stones at buses in various parts of Mumbai, while rail services on a main line across the city were disrupted, said a senior police official who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media.  \u201cTraffic has been disrupted in the eastern part of the city after protesters blocked a few roads,\u201d the official said.  More than 100 protesters were arrested, and Dalit leaders have called for more protests in Mumbai and elsewhere in Maharashtra state on Wednesday.  Government authorities appealed for calm.  Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has ordered a judicial inquiry into the clashes in Pun.

          "title": "Column: Hedge funds gamble OPEC will tighten oil market too much - Kemp",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds are the most bullish about oil prices in years, expecting further gains even as prices touch multi-year highs and ignoring the risk linked to such a large concentration of positions.  A record net long position has been accumulated by hedge funds and other money managers, amounting to 1,183 million barrels in the five biggest futures and options contracts covering crude, gasoline and heating oil.  Portfolio managers held a record 1,328 million barrels of long positions in Brent, WTI, U.S. gasoline and U.S. heating oil on Dec. 26, according to data published by regulators and exchanges.  By contrast, hedge funds held only 145 million barrels of short positions, the lowest level for 10 months and among the lowest at any point since the start of 2013.  Fund managers now hold more than nine long positions for every short position, the most bullish picture for at least five years (tmsnrt.rs/2CduGpC).  There are record net long positions in Brent crude (561 million barrels), WTI (461 million barrels) and U.S. heating oil (82 million barrels).  There are also large, if not quite record, net long positions in U.S. gasoline (79 million barrels) and European gasoil (131 million barrels).  In many of these contracts hedge fund positioning appears extremely stretched, with the ratio of long to short positions at multi-year highs.  The concentration of so many bullish positions poses a significant downside risk to prices if and when portfolio managers decide to close them out and realize some of their paper profits.  For the time being, however, most fund managers are ignoring the liquidation risk and focusing on the prospect of further price increases first.  There are plenty of reasons to be bullish about the outlook in 2018. The global economy is in a synchronized upswing and world trade is growing at the fastest rate since the start of the decade.  Stocks of crude and products have fallen significantly since the middle of 2017. Oil demand is growing rapidly while OPEC and its allies have extended their production pact until at least the middle of the year.  History suggests OPEC is more likely to tighten the oil market too much and allow prices to overshoot on the upside than rather than relax production cuts too early and risk prices falling back.  Such was the case after both the previous oil market slumps in 1997/98 and 2008/09, with prices overshooting the producer group\u2019s initial targets.  OPEC\u2019s tightening bias probably explains why many hedge funds remain bullish despite benchmark Brent prices moving towards $70 a barrel.  The main downside risk comes from a resurgence of U.S. shale oil production, with WTI prices now above $60 a barrel.  If shale output starts to climb faster than expected OPEC could be forced to halt production cuts earlier than currently envisaged.  The existence of so many hedge fund long positions could eventually magnify the downside risk posed by U.S. shale.  However, most hedge fund managers seem to have concluded that the risk is some way off and prices have more scope to climb before the inevitable correction.   Editing by David Goodman"

          "body": "* Asia shares ex-Japan cheered by upbeat China survey  * Dollar downtrodden after suffering worst year since 2003  * Commodities benefit from dollar weakness, China demand  * Oil prices hover at highest since mid-2015  * European shares squeezed down by currency strength  * Wall Street expected to start 0.3 percent higher  By Marc Jones  LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The ailing dollar fell to its lowest in over three months on Tuesday, while surprisingly upbeat Chinese manufacturing data ensured there was no serious new year hangover for world shares despite a groggy start for Europe.  Wall Street was expected to get 2018 off the mark with a small gain, with sentiment also helped by news that North Korea had offered an olive branch to South Korea. Kim Jong Un said he was \u201copen to dialogue\u201d with Seoul.  MSCI's broadest index of world shares climbed 0.2 percent, having set scores of record highs and risen by one-fifth in value last year. reut.rs/2zLv6kT  The driver overnight had again been Asia and its emerging markets.  Shanghai blue chips climbed 1.4 percent and MSCI\u2019s 24-country EM index jumped to a 5-1/2 year high after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline.  The reading pointed to resilience in the world\u2019s second-largest economy even as Beijing cracks down on industrial pollution and engineers a cooling property market.  \u201cManufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,\u201d said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.  In currency markets, the dollar remained out of favour having already hit a three-month low against a basket of its peers on Friday. That brought its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worse performance since 2003.  Its pain was the euro\u2019s gain though, with the single currency enjoying its strongest year against the dollar in 14 years.  On Tuesday, it jetted to a near-four-month top of $1.2081 as data showed that euro zone manufacturers ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.  It had already sliced through major resistance on the yen in Asia, reaching highs not seen since late 2015 at 135.45 yen . The rally against dollar meanwhile meant euro bulls were now eyeing the September peak of $1.2092, a break of which would take the currency to ground last trodden in late 2014.  \u201cForward-looking indicators bode well for the new year,\u201d Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit which compiled the manufacturing data, pointing to a near record pace of new orders and job creation by euro zone firms.  The pound, Swiss franc and Scandinavian currencies were also up solidly against the struggling dollar.  That combined with a two-month high in bond yields in Germany and Italy, two of the euro zone\u2019s biggest debt markets, pushed stock markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris 0.4-0.7 percent into the red.  Carmaker stocks caused the biggest dent, skidding 1.4 percent on weaker new car registrations data from France and forecasts that those in Britain would see as much as a 5 percent drop later in the week.  U.S. traders were gearing up for what was expected to be a steady first session of 2018, having seen the S&P 500 leap 22.5 percent last year but the dollar dive almost 10 percent.  A major hurdle for the U.S. currency will be Wednesday\u2019s release of minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting, when it raised interest rates. Two policymakers voted against the move amid doubts inflation would accelerate as hoped.  With the market now pricing in a 68 percent chance of a March hike and two hikes for 2018, there will be close inspection to assess just how shaky their confidence is for any pick-up in inflationary trends said Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at broker IG in Sydney.  \u201cThat said, the U.S. dollar is underloved and oversold and it won\u2019t take much to promote a bout of profit-taking from the shorts.\u201d  The skid in the dollar, combined with strength in Chinese demand, has benefited commodities priced into the currency.  Copper dipped back a little on Tuesday to $7,235.50 a tonne, but that follows a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top. Aluminium amassed gains of 34 percent.  Gold was 0.7 percent firmer at $1,311 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.  Brent crude oil futures ended the year with a 17 percent rise, while U.S. crude climbed 12 percent on strong demand and declining global inventories.  On Tuesday, Brent added another few cents at $66.92 a barrel, while U.S. crude firmed 7 cents to $60.48.  Alongside the upbeat China data, factory activity had also hit a five-year high in India and the best in 6-1/2 years in Taiwan.  In emerging Europe, Hungary\u2019s Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) recorded its strongest December on record, Czech data was at the highest since 2011 while Turkey\u2019s reading rose for a 10th straight month.  \u201cSome of the PMIs have been really strong and in central/eastern Europe we have seen some of the strongest numbers on record. So it looks like 2017 ended on a strong note in growth terms and that\u2019s translating into better sentiment on markets,\u201d said William Jackson at Capital Economics.

          "body": "CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - High school teacher Rajkumar Kotal had run out of ideas.  News about his students being pushed into early marriage and lured by traffickers reached him, but often too late to stop it.  But when police officials put a letter box in a discreet corner of the Ramgarhat High School in east Indian state of West Bengal, the problem was suddenly solved.  \u201cThe anonymity of that box gave students the confidence to ask questions, alert authorities and slowly we built a campaign around it to stop child marriages and prevent trafficking,\u201d Kotal, who teaches English, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  West Bengal accounted for 44 percent of human trafficking cases reported in India in 2016 and also had the most missing children reports, according to government data.  Young girls from poor families are lured with promises of marriage or jobs and trafficked to cities where they are sold to brothels or into domestic slavery, campaigners said.  The state government and charities working to prevent human trafficking have initiated a host of measures, including efforts to create a database of known traffickers.  The letter box scheme is part of a larger initiative by the West Bengal police which has proved so successful that now more than 20,000 students across 200 schools in the most vulnerable districts of the state have \u201cshared secrets\u201d and sought help.  Recognising the impact of the initiative, the U.N. children\u2019s agency UNICEF has now partnered with the police to expand the scope of the program across the state.   \u201cGirls from the state were being trafficked and then dumped on the streets of Delhi to die,\u201d said police officer Ajey Ranade, who is heading the initiative that is largely targeting school girls in vulnerable districts.  Police officers in plain clothes first started visiting schools in South 24 and North 24 Parganas districts - identified as trafficking hotspots - in 2016 to talk to students.  Many policemen had been on rescue missions and had been \u201cemotionally moved\u201d by the plight of trafficking survivors as they saw the impact it was having on young girls, Ranade said.   In schools, adolescents were at first reluctant to engage.  \u201cWe started playing a game called share your secret and suddenly information was flowing,\u201d said Suravi Sarkar of non-profit banglanatak.com which helped the police reach students.  Under the program, the police set up committees in schools to educate students about trafficking traps.  \u201cGirls appear to be more alert now and information has started flowing in,\u201d Ranade said.  \u201cStudents are telling us if a classmate has missed school for a few days, strangers hanging around the school route are being reported and some of this information has even led to arrests.\u201d  Kotal, who has been a teacher for 10 years, said he found courage to confront his students\u2019 problems with police backing.  \u201cEarlier some students would ask for help but we couldn\u2019t do much. This initiative has brought students, law enforcement, parents and teachers on the same platform,\u201d he said.

          "title": "Faster, lighter, springier: the quest for the perfect ski",
          "body": "ALTENMARKT, Austria (Reuters) - It is not just American hopes that will be riding on the performance of Mikaela Shiffrin when the world\u2019s top woman alpine skier takes to the slopes at the Winter Olympics in South Korea next month.  Half a world away in the small Austrian town of Altenmarkt, the marketing and tech teams at ski manufacturer Atomic will be closely watching the medal count in Pyeongchang, the culmination of about 18 months of internal company planning.  Of 900 staff based at the company south of Salzburg, 38 are part of a team of international specialists, whose job is to develop ever-sleeker and more manoeuvrable skis for everything from racing to backcountry touring.  Whereas in the early 1990s design was revolutionised by switching from long, straight racing skis to a side-cut \u2018parabolic\u2019 shape, and later shifts focused on the camber, or arch, of the ski, the trend in recent years has been towards more advanced materials such as titanium.  Atomic General Manager Wolfgang Mayrhofer said the thinner, less dense materials, including lighter wood cores, and the deeper sidecuts permitted under new giant slalom rules have made a big difference to the skis.  \u201cThe skis are easier to turn,\u201d said Austria\u2019s Marcel Hirscher, the six-times overall World Cup champion who is bidding for his first Olympic gold medal in Pyeongchang.  \u201cBut now with the new materials they can ski different lines, they keep the same stability and rigidity but they are much more flexible, much more dampening.  \u201cSo it\u2019s big progress since the Sochi days, since the last Olympics.\u201d   In the speed events of downhill and super-G there has been no fundamental change to ski design in the past 10 years, according to Matt Humphreys, winter sports boss at HEAD UK, but new materials have changed their composition.  Austria-based HEAD, whose skis are used by Olympic champions Lindsey Vonn, Ted Ligety, Kjetil Jansrud and Aksel Lund Svindal, have said it is the only manufacturer to incorporate graphene, a super-thin, super-strong form of carbon that was isolated by scientists only in 2004.  The point is not to make racing skis lighter, as a heavier ski provides more stability for a downhill racer hitting speeds around 90 miles/hour (145 km/h) but to improve the flexibility and the distribution of power.  \u201cWith us using graphene, we can get the flex pattern exactly how we want it to be ... the more we put in, the stiffer and stronger the ski becomes,\u201d said Humphreys.  That cutting edge design does not end with the ski.  Minute, detailed effort goes into the fit and comfort of boots as well as their \u2018canting\u2019 - the slight inward- or outward-tilting angle of the shoe that is tailored to match the angle of the skier\u2019s knees.  \u201cWhere we try and get ahead of the game is with some of our top athletes,\u201d Humphreys said.   \u201cWe do have casts of their feet and their lower legs so we can work on them in terms of pressure points and customisation without the athlete having to be there.\u201d   For Atomic, their top athletes are local product Hirscher, who lives close to Altenmarkt, and Shiffrin, who won the slalom gold in Sochi and became the overall World Cup women\u2019s champion this year.  \u201cI started skiing on Atomic when I was 12 and have skied Atomic skis, boots, and bindings since then,\u201d the American told Reuters.  \u201cIt was just a natural progression for me to stick with the skis that I had been so confident on as I started racing on the World Cup.\u201d  Atomic, like the other manufacturers HEAD and Frances\u2019 Rossignol, send their technical experts to accompany the top racers at every event, working closely with their coaches and national federations, to tune and service their gear like a Formula One team to suit the conditions.  \u201cThey\u2019re athletes, they\u2019re champions, they\u2019re demanding,\u201d Mayrhofer added.  \u201cTherefore you need a team. For Hirscher, for Shiffrin you have a dedicated team with ski makers, boot specialists, you have all the experts there.\u201d  With the event now in sight, Mayrhofer said he felt quietly confident all of their planning would pay off.   \u201cI have a good feeling we are nicely prepared. I feel good we will have everything we need,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it\u2019s always (necessary) of course to be a bit lucky also.  \u201cBut we have great athletes, we have all the stuff together which is needed to win.\u201d  Reporting by Leonhard Foeger from Altenmarkt and Mark Trevelyan from London; additional reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Greg Stutchbury"

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The founder of debt-laden tech conglomerate LeEco has defied orders from Chinese regulators to return to the country before the end of 2017, saying he needed to stay in the United States as a fundraising for his electric car business was making progress.  The Beijing branch of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued a notice last week ordering LeEco CEO Jia Yueting to return to China to address a mounting debt pile linked to his firms and to protect investors\u2019 rights.  Jia said in a statement that he had asked his brother, Jia Yuemin, to meet the regulator face-to-face last Friday to provide a report after the notice was issued.   \u201cI am deeply sorry and blame myself for the negative impact of LeEco\u2019s debt crisis,\u201d he said in the statement that was posted on his official WeChat account on Tuesday.  \u201cThe fundraising for Faraday Future in the United States is making significant progress and there are many tasks I need to push forward in order to ensure the production and timely delivery of the FF91,\u201d he said, referring to a luxury electric vehicle (EV) that LeEco is developing with Faraday Future.   Questions have been raised about the outlook for the FF91, given LeEco\u2019s spiraling cash problems as well as its decision to pull out of a joint project with British sports carmaker Aston Martin to develop the RapidE electric car.   LeEco, an entertainment, electronics and electric vehicles group, has struggled to pay its debts after rapid expansion into multiple sectors sparked a cash crunch, a plunge in the shares of a listed unit and led to multiple defaults. At its peak LeEco owed creditors 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion).  Its main listed unit Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp (300104.SZ) said in a statement on Tuesday that it was trying to settle its debt problems to resolve liquidity issues and resume normal business operations.  Leshi\u2019s Tianjin unit is trying to get 3 billion yuan ($462 million) worth of funding from new and existing investors, as well as creditors, Leshi said in another statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange. That unit\u2019s main business is marketing smart and Internet TVs.  Struggling to support goals that included beating Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) in premium EV making, Jia has been trying to ride out the cash crunch by taking measures such as cutting staff numbers and selling assets.  Jia said he had asked his wife, Gan Wei, and brother to represent him at Leshi in exercising shareholder rights and handling the sale of assets. Jia stepped down as CEO of the group\u2019s main listed unit in May last year.  He also cited a single late payment in July as being one of the key causes of LeEco\u2019s cash-flow problems, saying it led to the freezing of his assets and prompted a slew of early loan recoveries. He said \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d reports had impacted the business.   Jia was placed on an official blacklist of debt defaulters in early December, a move taken by Chinese courts to put pressure on people and entities to repay debts.

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Hollywood stars including Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Chastain and Natalie Portman have backed a campaign against sexual harassment called Time\u2019s Up as donations flood in for a multi-million dollar legal fund to fight abuse cases in the workplace.  In an open letter in the New York Times, they said they particularly wanted to \u201clift up the voices\u201d of women in low-wage industries whose lack of financial stability left them vulnerable to exploitation.  \u201cI stand with ALL WOMEN across every industry to say #TIMESUP on abuse, harassment, materialization and underrepresentation,\u201d tweeted Witherspoon who won an Oscar for the Johnny Cash biopic \u201cWalk the Line\u201d.  The campaign comes after a slew of allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein last year sparked the #MeToo campaign, with women and men using social media to talk about their experiences of harassment.  More than 300 show business figures including actors, writers and directors launched the Time\u2019s Up initiative with a full page advert in the New York Times on New Year\u2019s Day, pledging to support workers in all industries fight sexual misconduct.  \u201cLet\u2019s all make this resolution for the year: No more accepting sexual harassment and inequality at work as normal.\u00a0It\u2019s NOT normal,\u201d tweeted actress Jessica Biel.  By early Tuesday the initiative, also backed by Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, had raised nearly $14 million of a $15 million target for a legal fund to help victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.  \u201cWe stand with all those who have endured sexual harassment: those who have come forward and those who have decided to remain quiet. It\u2019s time for change, and we must act now,\u201d the group said on their gofundme page.  \u201cThe voices of those affected in every industry have been silenced for too long.\u201d   They said harassment often continued because those responsible and employers never faced consequences and because of systematic gender inequality.   \u201cThe struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard and acknowledged in male-dominated workplaces must end; time\u2019s up on this impenetrable monopoly,\u201d they said.  The campaign with hashtag #timesup will also push for legislation to penalize companies that tolerate harassment and to discourage the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence victims, according to the New York Times.      \u201cTime\u2019s up on silence. Time\u2019s up on waiting. Time\u2019s up on tolerating discrimination, harassment or abuse,\u201d Oscar winner Portman wrote on Instagram.  Actors are being encouraged to wear black at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday to protest against sexual harassment.

          "title": "The Swiss mountain man who sets the ultimate test",
          "body": "(Reuters) - It\u2019s the ninth time he\u2019s designed the Olympic downhill ski course, but Bernhard Russi will still feel his nerves tauten when racing gets under way in South Korea next month.  The 69-year-old Swiss knows better than most the excitement  of competing at the highest level. He won the Olympic title in 1972 and was narrowly beaten by Austria\u2019s Franz Klammer four years later - the closest any men\u2019s downhill champion has come to making a successful defense of his crown.  Further playing on his nerves, though, is the knowledge of the extreme risks faced by the men and women trying to conquer the course he has set.  \u201cListen, I used to be a downhiller myself. This will never go away,\u201d Russi told Reuters. \u201cI will always be nervous because somewhere I am always also a little bit afraid, because I know too good that bad things can happen every moment, every time, every day.\u201d  The run-up to these Olympics has highlighted that danger, with the deaths of Frenchman David Poisson and German teenager Max Burkhart in the space of just several weeks in November and December.  While Russi sees the timing as a tragic coincidence, the risk inherent in the sport is a constant.   As he talks about the job of designing courses, it\u2019s clear he sees one of his most vital roles as building in a safety margin for the athletes at the same time as guaranteeing a thrilling spectacle.  \u201cI think in a good downhill I need at least three good jumps. I have to count that the jumps are probably 50 meters long, so I have to be careful that the landing zone is probably 70, 80 meters,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf I calculate that with the speed, and the edge and the steepness the racers will jump 50 meters, I have to give them an additional space of 10 to 20 meters for safely landing in case somebody misses the jump completely - then instead of jumping 45 meters he will fly for 70, and I have to make sure that if he makes this mistake he\u2019s not landing on the flat.\u201d  The complexity of the course designer\u2019s task varies hugely from one Olympics to the next, depending on whether there is existing ski infrastructure on the mountain.  The Jeongseon site in South Korea is one of several where Russi has started from zero - when he first went there in 2001, there was \u201cnothing at all. There was a forest road until maybe half-way up and from there nothing, not even a cat walk.\u201d  It was after the Koreans were finally awarded the Games in 2011, at their third attempt, that the Swiss set to work. Since then, he estimates he has visited about 30 times.  The first step is to study the maps, assessing the contours and judging the steepness of the various possible descents.    The second is to get his hiking boots on.  \u201cI always say I walk the mountain in order to be able to listen to what the mountain is telling me... Especially in this case, I felt that here is a mountain which has a lot of changing terrains.\u201d  Through his exploration, Russi gets to know the steep and flatter portions, discover the edges and ridges.   \u201cAfter I know that, I try to build up the story of the mountain. Is it a wild one, or is it a more technical one, or is it more speed or is it more air?\u201d  Sometimes he needs to modify the terrain, for example by filling in a hole or moving some earth to create an adequate landing zone.  But generally he aims to touch the mountain as little as possible. He\u2019s proud that for these Olympics, in the interest of sustainability, agreement was reached to build a single downhill course for men and women - something that hasn\u2019t been done before, but will be repeated when China hosts the Games in 2022.  After years of work, the time comes to test the course with the world\u2019s best skiers. Norway\u2019s Kjetil Jansrud won a men\u2019s World Cup downhill here in 2016, and Italy\u2019s Sofia Goggia pipped American Lindsey Vonn in a women\u2019s race last March - victories that should boost their confidence heading into the Games.  But the course will include some new tweaks for the Olympics.  \u201cIt has been tested very well but after the test there are always some small changes in course-setting and I think we can add a little bit of difficulty towards the Olympics - so I would say that the course will be more difficult than in 2016,\u201d said Russi.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very challenging downhill, a very difficult downhill, a very attractive downhill.\u201d  If he\u2019s done his job well, he will have set the stage next month - as he has so many times before - for what many see as the purest, most thrilling form of winter sports competition.  \u201cYou have the top of the mountain, you have the bottom of the mountain, and in between - that\u2019s the challenge,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe downhill is the mountain and the man.\u201d  Reporting by Mark Trevelyan; editing by Sudipto Ganguly"

Nine Iranians were killed in Isfahan province during anti-government protests on Monday night as security forces struggled to contain the boldest challenge to the clerical leadership since unrest in 2009.  Police have arrested more than 450 protesters in the capital Tehran over the past three days, the deputy provincial governor said.

          "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Television host Hoda Kotb was named the new co-anchor of the NBC News \u201cToday\u201d show on Tuesday, replacing former co-host Matt Lauer several weeks after the longtime anchor was fired for inappropriate sexual behavior, according to a network statement.  Kotb will join Savannah Guthrie during the first two hours of the popular program, starting at 7 a.m. EST (noon GMT), and become the first pair of women to host the show along with weatherman Al Roker and Orange Room host Carson Daly. Kotb will continue co-hosting the 10 a.m. hour of \u201cToday\u201d with Kathie Lee Gifford.  \u201cIt\u2019s 2018 and we are kicking off the year right because Hoda is officially the co-anchor of Today,\u201d said Guthrie, 46, who announced the news during the program\u2019s opening moments.  Kotb, 53, quickly filled in as co-host when Lauer was fired on Nov. 28 after a female colleague complained to NBC officials about a pattern of inappropriate sexual behavior that began while they were on assignment at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia, according to the network.  At least two other women went to NBC with similar complaints against Lauer following the first allegation. None of the women has been publicly identified.  \u201cRepairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I\u2019m committed to beginning that effort,\u201d Lauer said after he was fired.  Reuters has not independently verified the accusations.  Kotb joined NBC News in 1998 as a correspondent and has co-hosted the fourth hour of \u201cToday\u201d with Gifford since 2008. She also hosts a program on Sirius XM satellite radio.  \u201cOver the past several weeks, Hoda has seamlessly stepped into the co-anchor role alongside Savannah, and the two have quickly hit the ground running,\u201d NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said in an email to staff, according to Today.com.

          "title": "Alpine skiing: Snow chance? Outsiders compete against the odds",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Most of the top Alpine skiers have grown up on snow, which is something of a disadvantage for those whose countries see little of the stuff.  But that does not mean all of those \u2018outsiders\u2019 have no chance of success.  \u201cWe\u2019re always going to be behind the Austrians, French or whatever because they were on these mountains when they were four years old,\u201d says Britain\u2019s leading Alpine skier Dave Ryding.  \u201cWe don\u2019t learn the terrain, the snow, and you have to refine the skill of skiing on snow,\u201d the 31-year-old, who learnt to ski on dry slopes around England and Wales, told Reuters in an interview.  And yet Ryding finished second in the Kitzbuehel World Cup slalom last January, the best finish by a Briton in 35 years, and led the first leg of the season opener in Levi, Finland, in November before missing a gate in the second run.  He was sixth in the Madonna di Campiglio slalom in December and fourth in a parallel slalom city event in Oslo on New Year\u2019s Day.  \u201cI always believed I can catch them up, eventually,\u201d said the veteran of two Olympics.  Talk of a level playing field, even metaphorically, sits ill with a sport whose stars race down steep and icy pistes, over bumps and jumps and through the tight twists and turns of a rutted slalom slope.  The Austrians, Swiss and other \u2018snow powers\u2019 receive an avalanche of funding for the national sport, along with world class training facilities, while those without mountains on their doorstep look on enviously.  The Olympic men\u2019s downhill, the sport\u2019s blue riband event, has only ever been won by skiers from Alpine nations or the United States.  The World Cup has been hosted in 25 countries, from Australia to Argentina, but the only ones from outside that group to have won an Olympic Alpine medal are Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.  Luxembourg features on the list only because Austrian Marc Girardelli, who went on to become a five times overall World Cup champion, fell out with his national federation as a teenager and found another.  Ryding first trained on snow at 12, after starting on dry slopes, and moved to Austria at 18 to improve his technique. It has not been easy but his determination is paying off.  \u201cThey have it cushy,\u201d said the Briton of some of his Austrian rivals.  He recognized, however, that they were also more likely to suffer burnout from the pressure of competing from a much younger age.  Ryding is now well-funded, compared to previous British athletes, and has shown he can compete with the best. He has his own coach, service man, physio and assistant but it was not always thus.  \u201cIn the past, say three years ago, it was literally me and my coach and I was doing my own skis, I was doing everything myself so that was also very hard,\u201d he said.  \u201cBack then it was costing me personally 15-20,000 (euros)  ($23,719.78) a year... but my whole team budget back then was less than 100,000.  \u201cThe Austrian slalom team, their budget will be around six million. That\u2019s just for their season.\u201d  Marcel Hirscher, the Austrian who has been overall World Cup champion for the past six seasons and who beat Ryding in that Kitzbuehel slalom, can count on far greater support and resources.  Ski maker Atomic, who employ Hirscher\u2019s brother, will have a team of their own experts working with team coaches to ensure the equipment meets his every requirement.  The same goes for other top medal contenders on the World Cup circuit.   Team GB\u2019s Pyeongchang Chef de Mission Mike Hay pointed to Norway, also an Alpine force to be reckoned with, as another country making sure their athletes have every possible advantage.  \u201cThey\u2019re like a Formula One team,\u201d he said of their Nordic skiing investment. \u201cThey pull up to World Cup events with massive double-decker buses all fitted out for their wax techs below.\u201d  Yet Ryding\u2019s results have brought new respect from the established powers, more used to non-Alpine no-hopers turning up as colorful also-rans, as well as more than a few questions.  \u201cWhen I\u2019m sitting down at the chef de missions seminar a year out before the Games, the Swiss and Austrian guys around the table are going \u2018What are you guys doing there to have somebody coming up and taking a podium?\u2019,\u201d said Hay.  \u201cWe\u2019re a lot more professional than we used to be, when we turned up in a battered old car having driven 250km or more from the last race overnight.\u201d  ($1 = 0.8438 euros)  Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Sudipto Ganguly"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Five new platforms and a large concourse opened at London Bridge station on Tuesday as the development of the busy commuter hub in Britain\u2019s capital nears completion.      The station reopened after ten days of engineering work over Christmas and New Year, and the latest milestone in the work allowed busy commuter trains to London\u2019s Cannon Street station to stop at London Bridge once more.  London Bridge is Britain\u2019s fourth-busiest rail station, with 56 million passengers arriving into the city each year.  It serves as a major hub for arrivals from southeast England, and the north-south \u201cThameslink\u201d service will restore the station\u2019s link with London\u2019s Luton airport when the redevelopment is completed, scheduled for May.  The latest progress came as unions protested at London Bridge and dozens of other UK stations on Tuesday against the introduction of higher ticket prices for the New Year.  On average, train fares have gone up 3.4 percent, the steepest price increase in five years. Britain\u2019s Network Rail said the average rise was below inflation, though campaigners say that fares should be pegged to a different measure of prices.

          "title": "Alpine skiing: Speed merchants still kings of the hill",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Olympic downhills have a special allure, with the fastest and bravest Alpine skiers going full tilt for gold and a place in history.  Pyeongchang will see no change there but newer events more targeted at millenials and younger audiences may be muscling in on the limelight enjoyed by the traditional blue riband races.  The mixed team event, run already at world championships and featuring male and female skiers in a parallel slalom format with races lasting some 25 seconds, should be a hit on its   Olympic debut.  \u201cI think it will be one of the highlights of the Olympics,\u201d women\u2019s Alpine race director Atle Skaardal, a two times men\u2019s Super-G world champion for Norway, said before the season started.  Freestyle skiing, slopestyle and big air snowboarding \u2014 another eye-catching 2018 Olympic newcomer \u2014 have the added appeal of proving more accessible to skiers from non-Alpine nations.  Traditional Alpine skiing has been woven into the fabric of the Games since 1936, even if the men\u2019s downhill did not appear until 1948, and a core element for broadcasters and the commercial sector alike.   That remains the case, despite the increasing range of media platforms and fragmentation of the audience as a whole.  \u201cAlpine is always going to be the blue riband,\u201d Matt Humphreys, winter sports boss at the UK division of ski suppliers Head told Reuters.  \u201cWhen you look at these other events like slopestyle, skicross, the younger sports, they do capture the imagination probably a little bit better than Alpine because it\u2019s newer and fresher.  \u201cBut ... I think it\u2019s always going to be the Alpine that wins out.\u201d  Reflecting its big ticket status, the men\u2019s downhill will be held on the opening Sunday of the Games at the Jeongseong Alpine centre.  About as extreme as it gets, the dangerous and daunting discipline sees racers hurtling in excess of 130kph down the mountain \u2014 and the winner often a surprise from far down the list of favorites.   For U.S. audiences the women\u2019s race on Feb. 21 could be an even bigger deal than the men\u2019s, with American speed queen Lindsey Vonn and all-rounder Mikaela Shiffrin two of the more recognizable names on the slopes.  Vonn, the most successful women\u2019s World Cup ski racer of all-time with a record 78 victories, has a portfolio of sponsors that includes Under Armour, Red Bull and Head and was ranked by Forbes as the third highest earning athlete at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.  NBC television said Pyeongchang, 14 hours ahead of U.S. Eastern Time (ET), will be their \u201cmost live primetime\u201d Winter Games yet and live Alpine skiing will feature on 11 of the 18 nights.  The U.S. network has already reported increased viewing figures for the North American rounds of the World Cup season.  Eurosport Chief Executive Peter Hutton said his broadcaster was also seeing increased viewing figures across snow sports, with all the Olympic competitions to be available on mobile devices.  \u201cSports such as snowboarding are doing a great job to attract younger audiences,\u201d he added.  Eurosport will also, for the first time, have a dedicated \u2018Radical Van\u2019 mobile social media studio at the PyeongChang Snowpark and other venues to cater for new audiences.  The growth of the newer sports, however, was not cannibalizing the traditional Alpine events and was in fact benefiting them, according Rob Prazmark, founder and chief executive of 21 Sports and Entertainment Marketing Group.  \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, for the Olympic Winter Games, that they are able to change up the sport to appeal to a younger and a different demographic,\u201d he told Reuters in a telephone interview.  \u201cI think interest in Alpine grows because of the addition of different or extreme sports \u2014 or sports that are really most popular with a younger demographic. The whole business of Alpine is growing.  \u201cDownhill Alpine is still extreme,\u201d added Prazmark, who has been involved in every Olympics since 1984 as a consultant and rights negotiator.  That said, he was aware from his own family how the recreational landscape was changing.  \u201cI\u2019ve got four kids. They run in ages from 34 to 21. My 21-year-old has never been on skis. She\u2019s only been on a snowboard,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t quite understand the attraction of skis.   \u201cSo that\u2019s where there\u2019s a big shift into the extreme sports, I believe.  \u201cIt\u2019s a generational, millennial thing as well.\u201d  Additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan, editing by Greg Stutchbury"

          "title": "The Swiss mountain man who sets the ultimate test",
          "body": "(Reuters) - It\u2019s the ninth time he\u2019s designed the Olympic downhill ski course, but Bernhard Russi will still feel his nerves tauten when racing gets under way in South Korea next month.  The 69-year-old Swiss knows better than most the excitement  of competing at the highest level. He won the Olympic title in 1972 and was narrowly beaten by Austria\u2019s Franz Klammer four years later - the closest any men\u2019s downhill champion has come to making a successful defense of his crown.  Further playing on his nerves, though, is the knowledge of the extreme risks faced by the men and women trying to conquer the course he has set.  \u201cListen, I used to be a downhiller myself. This will never go away,\u201d Russi told Reuters. \u201cI will always be nervous because somewhere I am always also a little bit afraid, because I know too good that bad things can happen every moment, every time, every day.\u201d  The run-up to these Olympics has highlighted that danger, with the deaths of Frenchman David Poisson and German teenager Max Burkhart in the space of just several weeks in November and December.  While Russi sees the timing as a tragic coincidence, the risk inherent in the sport is a constant.   As he talks about the job of designing courses, it\u2019s clear he sees one of his most vital roles as building in a safety margin for the athletes at the same time as guaranteeing a thrilling spectacle.  \u201cI think in a good downhill I need at least three good jumps. I have to count that the jumps are probably 50 meters long, so I have to be careful that the landing zone is probably 70, 80 meters,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf I calculate that with the speed, and the edge and the steepness the racers will jump 50 meters, I have to give them an additional space of 10 to 20 meters for safely landing in case somebody misses the jump completely - then instead of jumping 45 meters he will fly for 70, and I have to make sure that if he makes this mistake he\u2019s not landing on the flat.\u201d  The complexity of the course designer\u2019s task varies hugely from one Olympics to the next, depending on whether there is existing ski infrastructure on the mountain.  The Jeongseon site in South Korea is one of several where Russi has started from zero - when he first went there in 2001, there was \u201cnothing at all. There was a forest road until maybe half-way up and from there nothing, not even a cat walk.\u201d  It was after the Koreans were finally awarded the Games in 2011, at their third attempt, that the Swiss set to work. Since then, he estimates he has visited about 30 times.  The first step is to study the maps, assessing the contours and judging the steepness of the various possible descents.    The second is to get his hiking boots on.  \u201cI always say I walk the mountain in order to be able to listen to what the mountain is telling me... Especially in this case, I felt that here is a mountain which has a lot of changing terrains.\u201d  Through his exploration, Russi gets to know the steep and flatter portions, discover the edges and ridges.   \u201cAfter I know that, I try to build up the story of the mountain. Is it a wild one, or is it a more technical one, or is it more speed or is it more air?\u201d  Sometimes he needs to modify the terrain, for example by filling in a hole or moving some earth to create an adequate landing zone.  But generally he aims to touch the mountain as little as possible. He\u2019s proud that for these Olympics, in the interest of sustainability, agreement was reached to build a single downhill course for men and women - something that hasn\u2019t been done before, but will be repeated when China hosts the Games in 2022.  After years of work, the time comes to test the course with the world\u2019s best skiers. Norway\u2019s Kjetil Jansrud won a men\u2019s World Cup downhill here in 2016, and Italy\u2019s Sofia Goggia pipped American Lindsey Vonn in a women\u2019s race last March - victories that should boost their confidence heading into the Games.  But the course will include some new tweaks for the Olympics.  \u201cIt has been tested very well but after the test there are always some small changes in course-setting and I think we can add a little bit of difficulty towards the Olympics - so I would say that the course will be more difficult than in 2016,\u201d said Russi.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very challenging downhill, a very difficult downhill, a very attractive downhill.\u201d  If he\u2019s done his job well, he will have set the stage next month - as he has so many times before - for what many see as the purest, most thrilling form of winter sports competition.  \u201cYou have the top of the mountain, you have the bottom of the mountain, and in between - that\u2019s the challenge,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe downhill is the mountain and the man.\u201d  Reporting by Mark Trevelyan; editing by Sudipto Ganguly"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Most of the top Alpine skiers have grown up on snow, which is something of a disadvantage for those whose countries see little of the stuff.  But that does not mean all of those \u2018outsiders\u2019 have no chance of success.  \u201cWe\u2019re always going to be behind the Austrians, French or whatever because they were on these mountains when they were four years old,\u201d says Britain\u2019s leading Alpine skier Dave Ryding.  \u201cWe don\u2019t learn the terrain, the snow, and you have to refine the skill of skiing on snow,\u201d the 31-year-old, who learnt to ski on dry slopes around England and Wales, told Reuters in an interview.  And yet Ryding finished second in the Kitzbuehel World Cup slalom last January, the best finish by a Briton in 35 years, and led the first leg of the season opener in Levi, Finland, in November before missing a gate in the second run.  He was sixth in the Madonna di Campiglio slalom in December and fourth in a parallel slalom city event in Oslo on New Year\u2019s Day.  \u201cI always believed I can catch them up, eventually,\u201d said the veteran of two Olympics.  Talk of a level playing field, even metaphorically, sits ill with a sport whose stars race down steep and icy pistes, over bumps and jumps and through the tight twists and turns of a rutted slalom slope.  The Austrians, Swiss and other \u2018snow powers\u2019 receive an avalanche of funding for the national sport, along with world class training facilities, while those without mountains on their doorstep look on enviously.  The Olympic men\u2019s downhill, the sport\u2019s blue riband event, has only ever been won by skiers from Alpine nations or the United States.  The World Cup has been hosted in 25 countries, from Australia to Argentina, but the only ones from outside that group to have won an Olympic Alpine medal are Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.  Luxembourg features on the list only because Austrian Marc Girardelli, who went on to become a five times overall World Cup champion, fell out with his national federation as a teenager and found another.  Ryding first trained on snow at 12, after starting on dry slopes, and moved to Austria at 18 to improve his technique. It has not been easy but his determination is paying off.  \u201cThey have it cushy,\u201d said the Briton of some of his Austrian rivals.  He recognized, however, that they were also more likely to suffer burnout from the pressure of competing from a much younger age.  Ryding is now well-funded, compared to previous British athletes, and has shown he can compete with the best. He has his own coach, service man, physio and assistant but it was not always thus.  \u201cIn the past, say three years ago, it was literally me and my coach and I was doing my own skis, I was doing everything myself so that was also very hard,\u201d he said.  \u201cBack then it was costing me personally 15-20,000 (euros)  ($23,719.78) a year... but my whole team budget back then was less than 100,000.  \u201cThe Austrian slalom team, their budget will be around six million. That\u2019s just for their season.\u201d  Marcel Hirscher, the Austrian who has been overall World Cup champion for the past six seasons and who beat Ryding in that Kitzbuehel slalom, can count on far greater support and resources.  Ski maker Atomic, who employ Hirscher\u2019s brother, will have a team of their own experts working with team coaches to ensure the equipment meets his every requirement.  The same goes for other top medal contenders on the World Cup circuit.   Team GB\u2019s Pyeongchang Chef de Mission Mike Hay pointed to Norway, also an Alpine force to be reckoned with, as another country making sure their athletes have every possible advantage.  \u201cThey\u2019re like a Formula One team,\u201d he said of their Nordic skiing investment. \u201cThey pull up to World Cup events with massive double-decker buses all fitted out for their wax techs below.\u201d  Yet Ryding\u2019s results have brought new respect from the established powers, more used to non-Alpine no-hopers turning up as colorful also-rans, as well as more than a few questions.  \u201cWhen I\u2019m sitting down at the chef de missions seminar a year out before the Games, the Swiss and Austrian guys around the table are going \u2018What are you guys doing there to have somebody coming up and taking a podium?\u2019,\u201d said Hay.  \u201cWe\u2019re a lot more professional than we used to be, when we turned up in a battered old car having driven 250km or more from the last race overnight.\u201d  ($1 = 0.8438 euros)  Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Sudipto Ganguly"

          "body": "ALTENMARKT, Austria (Reuters) - It is not just American hopes that will be riding on the performance of Mikaela Shiffrin when the world\u2019s top woman alpine skier takes to the slopes at the Winter Olympics in South Korea next month.  Half a world away in the small Austrian town of Altenmarkt, the marketing and tech teams at ski manufacturer Atomic will be closely watching the medal count in Pyeongchang, the culmination of about 18 months of internal company planning.  Of 900 staff based at the company south of Salzburg, 38 are part of a team of international specialists, whose job is to develop ever-sleeker and more manoeuvrable skis for everything from racing to backcountry touring.  Whereas in the early 1990s design was revolutionised by switching from long, straight racing skis to a side-cut \u2018parabolic\u2019 shape, and later shifts focused on the camber, or arch, of the ski, the trend in recent years has been towards more advanced materials such as titanium.  Atomic General Manager Wolfgang Mayrhofer said the thinner, less dense materials, including lighter wood cores, and the deeper sidecuts permitted under new giant slalom rules have made a big difference to the skis.  \u201cThe skis are easier to turn,\u201d said Austria\u2019s Marcel Hirscher, the six-times overall World Cup champion who is bidding for his first Olympic gold medal in Pyeongchang.  \u201cBut now with the new materials they can ski different lines, they keep the same stability and rigidity but they are much more flexible, much more dampening.  \u201cSo it\u2019s big progress since the Sochi days, since the last Olympics.\u201d   In the speed events of downhill and super-G there has been no fundamental change to ski design in the past 10 years, according to Matt Humphreys, winter sports boss at HEAD UK, but new materials have changed their composition.  Austria-based HEAD, whose skis are used by Olympic champions Lindsey Vonn, Ted Ligety, Kjetil Jansrud and Aksel Lund Svindal, have said it is the only manufacturer to incorporate graphene, a super-thin, super-strong form of carbon that was isolated by scientists only in 2004.  The point is not to make racing skis lighter, as a heavier ski provides more stability for a downhill racer hitting speeds around 90 miles/hour (145 km/h) but to improve the flexibility and the distribution of power.  \u201cWith us using graphene, we can get the flex pattern exactly how we want it to be ... the more we put in, the stiffer and stronger the ski becomes,\u201d said Humphreys.  That cutting edge design does not end with the ski.  Minute, detailed effort goes into the fit and comfort of boots as well as their \u2018canting\u2019 - the slight inward- or outward-tilting angle of the shoe that is tailored to match the angle of the skier\u2019s knees.  \u201cWhere we try and get ahead of the game is with some of our top athletes,\u201d Humphreys said.   \u201cWe do have casts of their feet and their lower legs so we can work on them in terms of pressure points and customisation without the athlete having to be there.\u201d   For Atomic, their top athletes are local product Hirscher, who lives close to Altenmarkt, and Shiffrin, who won the slalom gold in Sochi and became the overall World Cup women\u2019s champion this year.  \u201cI started skiing on Atomic when I was 12 and have skied Atomic skis, boots, and bindings since then,\u201d the American told Reuters.  \u201cIt was just a natural progression for me to stick with the skis that I had been so confident on as I started racing on the World Cup.\u201d  Atomic, like the other manufacturers HEAD and Frances\u2019 Rossignol, send their technical experts to accompany the top racers at every event, working closely with their coaches and national federations, to tune and service their gear like a Formula One team to suit the conditions.  \u201cThey\u2019re athletes, they\u2019re champions, they\u2019re demanding,\u201d Mayrhofer added.  \u201cTherefore you need a team. For Hirscher, for Shiffrin you have a dedicated team with ski makers, boot specialists, you have all the experts there.\u201d  With the event now in sight, Mayrhofer said he felt quietly confident all of their planning would pay off.   \u201cI have a good feeling we are nicely prepared. I feel good we will have everything we need,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it\u2019s always (necessary) of course to be a bit lucky also.  \u201cBut we have great athletes, we have all the stuff together which is needed to win.\u201d  Reporting by Leonhard Foeger from Altenmarkt and Mark Trevelyan from London; additional reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Greg Stutchbury"

          "title": "Alpine skiing: Speed merchants still kings of the hill",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Olympic downhills have a special allure, with the fastest and bravest Alpine skiers going full tilt for gold and a place in history.  Pyeongchang will see no change there but newer events more targeted at millenials and younger audiences may be muscling in on the limelight enjoyed by the traditional blue riband races.  The mixed team event, run already at world championships and featuring male and female skiers in a parallel slalom format with races lasting some 25 seconds, should be a hit on its   Olympic debut.  \u201cI think it will be one of the highlights of the Olympics,\u201d women\u2019s Alpine race director Atle Skaardal, a two times men\u2019s Super-G world champion for Norway, said before the season started.  Freestyle skiing, slopestyle and big air snowboarding \u2014 another eye-catching 2018 Olympic newcomer \u2014 have the added appeal of proving more accessible to skiers from non-Alpine nations.  Traditional Alpine skiing has been woven into the fabric of the Games since 1936, even if the men\u2019s downhill did not appear until 1948, and a core element for broadcasters and the commercial sector alike.   That remains the case, despite the increasing range of media platforms and fragmentation of the audience as a whole.  \u201cAlpine is always going to be the blue riband,\u201d Matt Humphreys, winter sports boss at the UK division of ski suppliers Head told Reuters.  \u201cWhen you look at these other events like slopestyle, skicross, the younger sports, they do capture the imagination probably a little bit better than Alpine because it\u2019s newer and fresher.  \u201cBut ... I think it\u2019s always going to be the Alpine that wins out.\u201d  Reflecting its big ticket status, the men\u2019s downhill will be held on the opening Sunday of the Games at the Jeongseong Alpine centre.  About as extreme as it gets, the dangerous and daunting discipline sees racers hurtling in excess of 130kph down the mountain \u2014 and the winner often a surprise from far down the list of favorites.   For U.S. audiences the women\u2019s race on Feb. 21 could be an even bigger deal than the men\u2019s, with American speed queen Lindsey Vonn and all-rounder Mikaela Shiffrin two of the more recognizable names on the slopes.  Vonn, the most successful women\u2019s World Cup ski racer of all-time with a record 78 victories, has a portfolio of sponsors that includes Under Armour, Red Bull and Head and was ranked by Forbes as the third highest earning athlete at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.  NBC television said Pyeongchang, 14 hours ahead of U.S. Eastern Time (ET), will be their \u201cmost live primetime\u201d Winter Games yet and live Alpine skiing will feature on 11 of the 18 nights.  The U.S. network has already reported increased viewing figures for the North American rounds of the World Cup season.  Eurosport Chief Executive Peter Hutton said his broadcaster was also seeing increased viewing figures across snow sports, with all the Olympic competitions to be available on mobile devices.  \u201cSports such as snowboarding are doing a great job to attract younger audiences,\u201d he added.  Eurosport will also, for the first time, have a dedicated \u2018Radical Van\u2019 mobile social media studio at the PyeongChang Snowpark and other venues to cater for new audiences.  The growth of the newer sports, however, was not cannibalizing the traditional Alpine events and was in fact benefiting them, according Rob Prazmark, founder and chief executive of 21 Sports and Entertainment Marketing Group.  \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, for the Olympic Winter Games, that they are able to change up the sport to appeal to a younger and a different demographic,\u201d he told Reuters in a telephone interview.  \u201cI think interest in Alpine grows because of the addition of different or extreme sports \u2014 or sports that are really most popular with a younger demographic. The whole business of Alpine is growing.  \u201cDownhill Alpine is still extreme,\u201d added Prazmark, who has been involved in every Olympics since 1984 as a consultant and rights negotiator.  That said, he was aware from his own family how the recreational landscape was changing.  \u201cI\u2019ve got four kids. They run in ages from 34 to 21. My 21-year-old has never been on skis. She\u2019s only been on a snowboard,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t quite understand the attraction of skis.   \u201cSo that\u2019s where there\u2019s a big shift into the extreme sports, I believe.  \u201cIt\u2019s a generational, millennial thing as well.\u201d  Additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan, editing by Greg Stutchbury"

          "body": "BERLIN, Jan 2 (Reuters) - German police have asked prosecutors to investigate a far-right lawmaker for possible incitement to hatred after she criticised a police force for tweeting in Arabic \u201cto appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hoards of men\u201d.  Police in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) posted a New Year\u2019s Eve greeting in Arabic as well as German, English and French. Cologne, a city where groups of mainly Arab immigrants were accused of sexual assaults at New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations two years ago, is located in the state.  \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with this country? Why is the official page of police in NRW tweeting in Arabic,\u201d Beatrix von Storch, a member of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), wrote in a Dec. 31 tweet that was later deleted by Twitter after receiving complaints from members of the public.  \u201cAre they seeking to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hoards of men?\u201d she added.  Twitter suspended her account for some 12 hours after she posted the message, saying it breached the micro-blogging website\u2019s rules that bar users from posting hateful messages.  Social media platforms face hefty fines in Germany if they fail to remove hateful postings swiftly, and companies like Facebook and Twitter have hired extra staff to monitor such messages.  The NRW police deployed large numbers of officers to secure New Year\u2019s street parties in large cities this year and said celebrations were largely peaceful.  Prosecutors in NRW must first decide whether they should deal with the police complaint against von Storch or transfer the case to Berlin authorities given that her constituency is in the capital.  If prosecutors deem there is sufficient grounds to launch an official criminal investigation against von Storch, they would first have to ask parliament to suspend her immunity before proceeding with a case.  Cologne Chief Prosecutor Ulf Willuhn said prosecutors must now decide whether von Storch\u2019s message amounted to \u201cinciting people to commit violence against a certain section of society\u201d.  Twitter also deleted a message by AfD member Alice Weidel in which she said German authorities wanted Germans to live with criminal mobs of migrants.  The AfD won seats in parliament for the first time in September, riding a wave of discontent against Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision in 2015 to open Germany\u2019s borders to more than a million asylum-seeking migrants.  The AfD, which says Islam is incompatible with the German constitution, is the third largest party in parliament. It has upended German politics by stealing voters from Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats, making coalition building more difficult.  AfD leaders reacted angrily to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete the two postings under a new law passed by parliament in June that authorises fines of up to 50 million euros against social media networks if they don\u2019t promptly remove hateful content.  \u201cThe censorship law of (Justice Minister) Heiko Maas has already showed on the first day of the year its ability to curtail freedom of expression,\u201d said AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland. \u201cI call on every social media user to take action against such oppression by reposting the deleted comments again and again!\u201d (Additional reporting by Hans-Edzard Busemann and Reuters TV; Editing by Peter Graff)"

Oil prices hovered near their mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.

It finished 2017 with its best year against the dollar since 2003 as European economies strengthened and expectations the European Central Bank will wind down its monetary stimulus grew, boosting demand for the single currency.  The euro started the year by adding to those gains, and climbing as much as 0.6 percent to a four-month high of $1.2081, within sights of the $1.2092 it hit in September, the highest since early 2015.  The single currency was also higher against the Japanese yen at 135.64, reaching levels not seen since late 2015.  Euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high.  \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of dollar weakness and euro strength. The euro strength is underpinned by some hawkish comments from the ECB\u2019s Coeure,\u201d said Commerzbank currency strategist Thu Lan Nguyen in Frankfurt, referring to comments made by the European Central Bank\u2019s Benoit Coeure  Coeure said on the weekend he saw a \u201creasonable chance\u201d the bank\u2019s bond purchases would not be extended beyond September.  Nguyen said the euro was approaching levels where the ECB might start to signal some discomfort with its rise.  The euro gained as the dollar was broadly weak. The dollar\u2019s index against a basket of six major currencies slipped to 91.75, its weakest level since September.  For the whole of 2017, the dollar index slid more than 9.8 percent, the greenback\u2019s worst annual performance since 2003.  Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London, said the end of a dollar funding squeeze typical of December and a rally in commodity prices, had reduced demand for dollars since the holiday season, but that the euro was also gaining because of the better economic performance of its member states.  \u201cFundamentally, what is helping the euro is the brightening economic outlook in the euro area. The momentum should continue,\u201d he said.  Tan said Societe Generale forecasts the euro will strengthen to $1.25 by the middle of the year.  Some foreign exchange strategists said traders were wary of taking on big positions ahead of the introduction on Wednesday of the wide-ranging EU financial markets directive known as MiFID II, which is aimed at making European markets more transparent and providing better value for investors.

The largest tax overhaul since the 1980s cuts the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.  Following is a list of European companies impacted by the changes (in alphabetical order):  ** Barclays (BARC.L) expects to take a writedown of about 1 billion pounds ($1.34 billion) on the British bank\u2019s 2017 post-tax profit.  ** BMW (BMWG.DE) expects tax benefits to lift the German carmaker\u2019s 2017 net profit by between 950 million and 1.55 billion euros.  ** BP (BP.L) will take a one-off, non-cash $1.5 billion charge in the energy company\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings, although it expects the new tax rules to positively impact its U.S. earnings in the long run.  ** Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) expects to take a writedown of 2.3 billion Swiss francs ($2.3 billion) during its fourth quarter after the U.S. tax changes.  ** Daimler (DAIGn.DE) expects an income tax benefit of about 1.7 billion euros in the German carmaker\u2019s 2017 results.  ** Iberdrola (IBE.MC) expects the changes to produce income of 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2017\u200d\u200b, the Spanish utility said.  ** Qiagen (QIA.DE)QGEN.O will take an extraordinary post-tax charge on net income of about $110-120 million in the fourth quarter related to deferred tax assets, revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and other tax provisions, the biotech company said.  ** Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) will incur a charge to earnings of $2 billion to $2.5 billion on the basis of its third-quarter statements, the energy company said, but added it expected the tax legislation to have a \u201cfavorable\u201d impact on its operations in the future.  ** UBS (UBSG.S) expects a 2.8 billion Swiss franc ($2.88 billion) writedown in the fourth quarter because of the U.S. tax changes, newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Johanna Konta was pushed to the brink for the second time in as many rounds before advancing to the quarter-finals while world number two Garbine Muguruza of Spain succumbed to leg cramps in her opening clash at the Brisbane International on Tuesday.  Konta, who overcame local hope Ajla Tomljanovic 4-6 6-1 6-4 in two hours and 26 minutes at the Pat Rafter Arena, set up a meeting with the winner of the match between Ukraine\u2019s Elina Svitolina and Croatia\u2019s Ana Konjuh.  The Briton faced 13 break points in the first set and struggled with her rhythm as the big-hitting Tomljanovic stormed into an early lead.  Konta, who had similar struggles with her serve in her opening match against American Madison Keys, a U.S. Open finalist, on Monday, responded with a better performance to level the contest.  The world number nine raced to a 5-2 lead in the deciding set before Tomljanovic showed signs of fighting back. However, Konta held on to finish the job.  \u201cShe made that very difficult, so that\u2019s a credit to her and she played incredibly freely at the end of the third set,\u201d Konta said after the match. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot in it so I\u2019m very happy to have just stayed tough and just come through that.  \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s a great thing to have two tough matches early on. It\u2019s a boost, the match fitness, and it boosts a lot of the competitive scenarios that we\u2019re going to face the whole year. I\u2019m sure my next match will be the same.\u201d  Muguruza\u2019s wretched run of injury problems at Brisbane extended to a fourth consecutive year with the Spaniard unable to continue while leading 2-1 in the deciding third set against Serbia\u2019s Aleksandra Krunic.  Meanwhile, France\u2019s Alize Cornet defeated Croatia\u2019s Mirjana Lucic-Baroni 6-1 7-5 to move into the quarter-finals and was joined by seventh seed Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia who beat Romania\u2019s Sorana Cirstea 6-2 6-1.

Mihai Alexandru Isvanca and Eveline Cismaru were arrested in Romania on Dec. 15 over the incident, which compromised Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department camera computers as part of a ransomware scheme, the Justice Department said in a statement.  \u201cThis case was of the highest priority due to its impact on the Secret Service\u2019s protective mission and its potential effect on the security plan for the 2017 Presidential Inauguration,\u201d the statement said.   U.S. officials said the alleged conspiracy compromised the city police department\u2019s camera computers between Jan. 9 and Jan. 12 but did not threaten anyone\u2019s physical security.   It did, however, store two ransomware variants called \u201ccerber\u201d and \u201cdharma\u201d on police computers, the statement said.   The two Romanians also intended to email the ransomware to 179,000 email addresses, according to the statement. \u201cThe investigation also identified certain victims who had received the ransomware or whose servers had been accessed during the scheme,\u201d it said.  Isvanca and Cismaru were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit various forms of computer fraud, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, the Justice Department said.

          "body": "SOFIA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Bulgaria\u2019s anti-monopoly watchdog has rejected a demand by Ukrainian arms company Ukrinmash to stop the Balkan country\u2019s 81.3 million levs ($50.2 million) fighter jet deal with Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG.  Bulgaria last month asked the Russian company to overhaul and maintain 15 of its ageing MiG fighter jets. The country was about to sign a four-year deal, but had to put that on hold following an appeal by Ukrinmash.  The decision of the Commission for the Protection of Competition can be appealed within three days of notification, the watchdog said in a statement.  The Black Sea country considered the MiG maker as the only company capable of providing reliable support for the aircraft and did not invite other bidders for the deal.  Relations between Ukraine and Russia are at a low ebb after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its backing for separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Bulgaria, which joined the EU in 2007 and NATO three years earlier, says it needs to keep its Soviet-era aircraft operational after plans to buy eight new fighter jets hit another snag. That process is expected to start almost from scratch sometime this year.  $1 = 1.6205 leva\nReporting by Angel Krasimirov; Editing by Mark Potter"

The French equivalent jumped by 56.4 percent to 58.5 euros.  * Thomson Reuters data showed demand in Germany is expected to average 68.5 gigawatts (GW) next week, compared with 67.6 GW expected for Tuesday. In temperature-sensitive France, demand is forecast to jump to 71 GW next week from 60.3 GW on Tuesday.  * Average temperatures are predicted to fall to 0.6 degrees Celsius in Germany next week from the current 5.2 degrees. In France, they may fall to 4.1 degrees from 9 degrees.  * Wind volumes are expected to double on Wednesday in Germany to 32.2 GW, driving down the day-ahead price by 67 percent to 10.9 euros, while the equivalent in France lost 33.3 percent to 25 euros, with more nuclear capacity available.  * German day 2 and 3 positions were even negative, meaning consumers are paid to take power, as networks are overloaded and storage is minimal.  * French nuclear availability has improved by 1.4 percentage points since Friday to stand at 90.2 percent of capacity.  * Among distant contracts, the German year-ahead Cal\u2019 19 delivery contract lost 30 cents to 37 euros. The 2018 contract had traded around 37.9 euros before its expiry at the end of 2017.  * Traders said forwards were responding to heavy falls in carbon emissions rights prices although coal, another important generation input, gained sharply and oil also pointed higher.  * December 2018 expiry carbon fell 1.47 percent to 8.06 euros a tonne.  * Cif Europe coal for 2019 was up 1.4 percent at $86.3 a tonne. The 2018 delivery contract had hit $90.7 on Dec. 13, the highest price of a year-ahead position since May 2013.  * Elsewhere, Germany\u2019s biggest generator, utility RWE, announced a reorganisation of its gas, hard coal and biomass production in the RWE Generation unit and the RWE Power business. The latter is to focus on brown coal operations and remaining nuclear plants. ($1 = 0.8288 euros) (Reporting by Vera Eckert; Editing by Mark Potter)"

          "body": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt has hanged four men convicted by a military court of killing three military students in a bombing in 2014, security sources said on Tuesday.  It was the second reported multiple execution of convicted Islamist militants in a week. A week ago Egypt hanged 15 men  accused of deadly attacks in the Sinai peninsula, believed to be the largest number of people executed in a single day since President Abdel Fateh al-Sisi took power.  The latest executions were carried out in the Borg al-Arab prison, west of the coastal city of Alexandria, after the military appeals court rejected appeals by the defendants, the sources said.  The four were hanged for their role in a bombing in the Nile Delta town of Kafr al-Sheikh that took place during violence that followed the ouster of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Sisi, then the military chief, removed Mursi in mid-2013 after mass protests against Mursi\u2019s rule.  The court also sentenced three others in absentia to death, and jailed eight others, including Salah al-Feki, head of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s administrative office in Kafr al-Sheikh.  Authorities banned the Brotherhood and declared it a terrorist organization after Mursi was deposed, arresting thousands of its members and supporters.  Since then, Egypt has faced a growing insurgency from Islamic State fighters in the Sinai Peninsula.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China has eased restrictions on coal imports by quickening the customs clearing process, sources in the trade and at utilities said on Tuesday, dampening record high prices as cheaper foreign supply lands at ports.  The country tightened imports by banning small ports from receiving foreign coal cargoes and delaying the process of issuing quality reports for imports from July 1.   Traders said it took as many as 40 days to clear customs  compared with one to two weeks previously.   Prices of the most-active thermal coal futures have fallen more than 5 percent from a record high of 641 yuan ($98.77) per ton hit on Dec. 18.   Sources said authorities at major coal import hubs have shortened the time it has taken to issue a quality inspection report for foreign coal cargoes and have cut random checks  since late December.  \u201cMore supplies are arriving at ports as utilities ready to stock up cheaper foreign coal,\u201d a Beijing-trader said.  A campaign to switch millions of households from using coal to natural gas has created a shortage of natural gas, forcing factories and many gas power plants to shut.   The campaign also unexpectedly boosted demand from coal-fired power plants, which are operating at higher rates to provide electricity for winter heating.  \u201cPower plants signed a large amount of import contracts for January and reduce consumption of high-price domestic thermal coal,\u201d another trader said.  In December, China temporarily halted imports by delaying customs clearance after the total import volume exceeded an unofficial government target, two trade sources said.  Market players, however, expect the curbs to make a comeback as early as next month on weakening demand.

          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Iran spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually to help allies fighting elsewhere in the Middle East and this outlay  appears to be rising, Israel\u2019s armed forces chief said on Tuesday.  Lieutenant-General Gadi Eizenkot\u2019s remarks coincided with almost a week of Iranian street protests that initially focused on economic hardships but have turned overtly political - though he did not comment directly on that unrest.  Eizenkot accused Iran, Israel\u2019s arch-foe, of working to forge a \u201cShi\u2019ite crescent\u201d of influence running through Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Bahrain and Palestinian-ruled Gaza.   \u201cJust glance at the scale of Iranian investment in order to achieve regional hegemony - it adds up to giving (Lebanese militia) Hezbollah between $1 billion and $700 million each year,\u201d he said in a speech to the IDC Herzliya university.   \u201cIn recent months, investment in the Palestinian arena has also been growing out of a desire to influence it - with an increase in the (annual) funding in the Gaza Strip for (militant groups) Hamas and Islamic Jihad to $100 million.\u201d  Iran is a Middle East big power deeply involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and supportive of Houthi forces in Yemen\u2019s war, as part of a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia. Many Iranians, however, resent the foreign interventions and want their leaders to create more jobs at home, where youth unemployment reached 29 percent last year.  Eizenkot did not give sources for his data on Iranian spending. Generally such statements are based on the estimates of Israel\u2019s intelligence services.  In mid-2017, Israeli defense officials assessed Iran was spending $800 million annually on Hezbollah, and $70 million on Hamas - Gaza\u2019s dominant faction - and the smaller Islamic Jihad.        Both Palestinian groups acknowledged Iranian backing last month, which suggested Tehran is reorienting its regional efforts as the Syrian civil war winds down in favor of President Bashar al-Assad, whom it reinforced.  Islamic Jihad said that Qassem Soleimani, a senior Iranian general, spoke to its leadership to \u201cstress Iran\u2019s support for the Palestinian resistance\u201d. Hamas said it received a pledge from Iranian President Hassan Rouhani that Tehran would \u201cspare no effort in supporting the Palestinian people\u201d.  Since U.S. President Donald Trump infuriated Palestinians by recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital on Dec. 6, there have been almost nightly militant rocket and mortar bomb attacks from Gaza on Israel, which has responded with air strikes.  Israel says Hamas bears overall responsibility although the launches were carried out by rival Islamist factions, and it accuses Iran of arming these groups as well.  Citing this alleged Iranian involvement, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Tuesday that avoiding escalation in Gaza was in order.   \u201cThe Israeli interest is that the international community\u2019s attention be entirely on Iran, and not to launch an all-out campaign in Gaza which would distract attention from Iran,\u201d Lieberman told Army Radio.  Eizenkot further said that since 2012 Iran had also spent \u201cbillions\u201d of dollars on Syria. He said Iran currently had around 2,000 military advisers in Syria deployed alongside 10,000 foreign Shi\u2019ite militiamen and 8,000 Hezbollah fighters.  Iran spends \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars more on allies in Iraq and Yemen, Eizenkot added.

          "body": "NEW DELHI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Electricity tariffs across India are expected to rise by 62 to 93 paise ($0.0098-$0.0146) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) during the first year of upgrades to coal-fired power plants, Power Minister R.K. Singh told lawmakers on Tuesday.  The estimate of tariff increases of up to nearly 20 percent on average power fees comes amid rising levels of smog in the capital and other major cities, which has put pressure on the government and generators to tackle a growing public health crisis.  Power tariffs are a politically sensitive issue in India, where more than three quarters of the electricity is generated by coal-fired power plants. The average power tariff in India is around 5 rupees per kWh.  Reuters reported in November that India was considering letting power companies pass on costs of installing emission-cutting equipment to consumers.  India, which is looking to facilitate loans to power producers through state-run financial institutions to fund one-time costs, aims to make all coal-fired power plants comply with emission-cutting norms by 2022, Central Electrical Authority (CEA) Chairman Ravindra Kumar Verma told Reuters in November.  CEA has prepared a phase-in plan for implementing new environmental norms to ensure minimum disruption while plants are shut down for retrofitting, Singh told the upper house of India\u2019s parliament in a written reply.  Thermal power companies account for 80 percent of all industrial emissions of lung-damaging particulate matter, sulphur and nitrous oxides in India.  $1 = 63.5300 Indian rupees\nReporting by Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Tom Hogue"

          "body": "SAO PAULO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Tie-up talks between Boeing Co and Embraer SA do not contemplate a change of control at the Brazilian planemaker and are focused on joint ventures and joint business agreements, a Brazilian newspaper reported on Tuesday.  Citing sources familiar with the talks, Valor Econ\u00f4mico said the companies were looking at forming joint business agreements in which they divide costs and income in certain areas, or JVs, in which both companies enter independently into a partnership.  Among the areas Boeing was looking to focus on, the paper said, was complementing its aircraft portfolio, expanding sales platforms, and developing new products.  Such an arrangement would likely ease regulatory pressure surrounding the deal, as Brazil\u2019s government has repeatedly said it is opposed to Boeing gaining control over Embraer due to the planemaker\u2019s key role in Brazil\u2019s defense sector. However, it may point to limits to the ambitions of a potential tie-up.  Neither Boeing nor Embraer immediately responded to a request for comment.  On Dec. 21, the two planemakers said they were discussing a \u201cpotential combination,\u201d in a move that could consolidate a global passenger jet duopoly.  The talks are widely seen as a way for Boeing to strengthen its position in the regional jetliner market, in which Embraer is strong, thanks largely to its 70- to 130-seat E-Jets.  Less than three months ago, Boeing\u2019s European arch-rival Airbus SE agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc\u2019s 100- to 130-seat CSeries jet, putting pressure on the U.S. planemaker to seek a similar partnership.  The Boeing-Embraer talks involve Embraer\u2019s defense business, as well as its passenger business, sources have said.  In the Tuesday report, Valor said Boeing was confident it could convince Brazil\u2019s government that it could safely operate in Brazil\u2019s defense sector, partially by pointing to defense deals the U.S. planemaker has made in countries such as Australia.

The five-times grand slam champion fired 34 winners and saved seven out of 10 break points to get past her spirited opponent and set up a quarter-final clash with Kazakhstan\u2019s Zarina Diyas who beat local hope Zhang Shuai 6-3 6-7(5) 6-4.  Twice a finalist at Shenzhen, Riske used power and precision to breeze through the first set and went up 2-1 in the second to leave Sharapova in trouble. The Russian then reeled off five of the next six games to level the contest at one set apiece.  Sharapova did not let the momentum slip in the deciding set, winning the final four games of the match to prevail in two hours and 22 minutes.  \u201cI\u2019m glad I got this kind of match,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cThese are the kind of matches you need, especially with such a short preparation going into the Australian Open in terms of match play.\u201d  Earlier, Kristyna Pliskova, the twin of former world number one Karolina Pliskova, stunned French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko 6-1 6-4 and stormed into the second round.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks surged one percent on Tuesday to the highest in 5-1/2 years, lifted by a weak dollar, data indicating robust economic growth and bullish commodities.  Many emerging market country currencies also hit multi-week peaks.  The first trading day of the year saw emerging stocks and bonds extend the previous year\u2019s gains, especially after purchasing manager surveys in Asia showed Chinese December manufacturing at the strongest in four months. Those in some other markets such as India and Taiwan hit multi-year highs .  In emerging Europe, Hungary\u2019s PMI recorded its strongest December, Czech data was at the highest since 2011 while Turkey\u2019s rose for a 10th straight month.  \u201cSome of the PMIs have been really strong and in central/eastern Europe we have seen some of the strongest numbers on record. So it looks like 2017 ended on a strong note in growth terms and that\u2019s translating into better sentiment on markets,\u201d said William Jackson at Capital Economics.  Most emerging currencies firmed, led by the yuan which approached a four-month high to the weak dollar while in emerging Europe, the Turkish lira, Russian rouble, Polish zloty, Hungarian forint all hit multi-month highs to the greenback , rising by half a percent or more.  Asian shares rose to a new decade-high and Turkish markets jumped more than 1 percent.  Jackson said, however, the strength of the data indicated more central banks would move towards policy tightening, emulating countries such as the Czech Republic and South Korea which have already raised rates. That could signal that emerging stocks have already peaked in dollar terms, he warned.  \u201cWe have seen a slow shift in that direction already, I think Poland will need to follow suit this year. But on the other hand inflation is still fairly low, with some exceptions,\u201d Jackson added.  That should be confirmed later in the day in Poland where inflation is expected to slip back after a rise in November caused by food prices. Turkish inflation due on Wednesday may also show price growth had peaked in November.

          "body": "LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Euro zone factories ended 2017 growing at their fastest pace in more than two decades while performance in Asia was more uneven, with its third-largest economy India leading the field and manufacturing giant China unexpectedly resilient.  With a similar business survey covering the United States forecast to be strong, the synchronized global growth that took hold last year looks set to continue based on the first major economic data releases of 2018.   Euro zone factory activity is handily outpacing its peers, including Britain. That has added to expectations that the European Central Bank, which this month will halve its monthly bond purchases, will shutter the program later this year.   \u201cThe euro zone manufacturing boom gained further momentum in December, rounding off the best year on record and setting the scene for a strong start to 2018,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the surveys.   The December euro zone final manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) was 60.6, matching an earlier preliminary reading, the highest since the survey began in June 1997. Any figure above 50 represents growth.  The euro rose to a three-month high above $1.20.  The factory output index, which feeds into a broader set of data including services due on Thursday, rose to 62.2 from 61.0 in November. That was its highest in over 17 years and a reading exceeded only once in the survey\u2019s more than two decades of history.  Germany and France, the euro zone\u2019s two largest economies look to be expanding in tandem, striking their highest manufacturing PMI numbers on record and for 17 years, respectively. But growth slowed in Italy, the bloc\u2019s third largest economy.  In Britain, which is in the process of negotiating a withdrawal from the European Union, growth tailed off sharply from a four-year high the previous month.  \u201cStrong growth will be hard to sustain in 2018,\u201d noted Samuel Tombs, UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. He pointed out that the UK PMI had underperformed the euro zone\u2019s by the most since June 2008.   \u201cBritish manufacturers ... are failing to make the most of the rebound in global trade,\u201d Tombs wrote.   Factory activity hit a five-year high in India and the best in 6-1/2 years in Taiwan, and also picked up in China. But activity contracted in South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia, a sign that regional interest rate hikes are likely to be gradual.  \u201cRobust external demand and accommodative domestic monetary policy should help keep Asian manufacturing sectors in good shape,\u201d said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics.  In China, manufacturing growth unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December amid a surge in new orders, suggesting continued strength in global trade.  The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 from 50.8 in November, and far outpaced expectations in a Reuters poll for a dip to 50.6.  The China PMI, which pushed Asian shares .MIAPJ0000PUS to their highest in a decade, was somewhat at odds with a much larger official China PMI survey on Sunday. It showed a slowdown in growth amid a crackdown on pollution and measures to curb risky financing and cool the housing market.  The difference, analysts say, stems from the fact that the Caixin/PMI index tracks smaller, private firms, more sensitive to exports.  China is expected to have grown by close to 7 percent in 2017, but the world\u2019s second largest economy is likely to slow in the new year on the back of those measures, highlighted as policy priorities at October\u2019s key Communist Party congress.  Beijing is expected to target 2018 growth of around 6.5 percent.  \u201cWe believe a moderate growth slowdown to be more visible in the first half of 2018, especially on the investment front, due mainly to the tight financial conditions and a cool down of the property market,\u201d BofA Merrill Lynch economists said.  China\u2019s slowdown means that for the rest of Asia, the pace of rate increases is unlikely to match that of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is likely to raise interest rates three times this year, and possibly more.  There will likely be \u201conly a few rate hikes here and there across the region over the coming two years,\u201d HSBC analysts wrote in a note, even as they expect Asian economies to keep chugging along in 2018, led by tech and trade.  India\u2019s PMI showed factory activity expanding at the fastest pace in five years, buoyed by a rise in output and new orders, which allowed firms to raise prices. The data firmed up views that interest rates in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy have probably bottomed.  PMIs for Japan, which surpassed growth expectations in 2017 on the back of the surging tech and trade cycle globally, will be released on Thursday.  The U.S. manufacturing PMI is due later on Tuesday.   Reporting by Jonathan Cable and Marius Zaharia; Editing by Ross Finley and Catherine Evans"

          "title": "Breakingviews - Italy will go back to its old ways in 2018",
          "body": "MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - It\u2019s a sunny spring day and Italians are waking up to a new legislature. None of the country\u2019s political parties has won enough seats in the previous day\u2019s election to safely control parliament, yet each claims victory. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement earned the largest number of votes, Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia and its Northern League ally form the biggest political group, while the centre-left Democratic Party secured the most parliamentary seats. A flawed electoral law means a coalition - a regular feature of Italian politics - seems inevitable.  This is the imagined scenario the euro zone\u2019s third-largest economy could face in early 2018. As of late December, polls suggested each of the three main political groupings will attract between 24 percent and 35 percent of the vote. The risk is that gridlock tips Italy back into its old bad habits.  The new government\u2019s economic inheritance is positive. Growth is at its highest rate since 2010, exports and manufacturing activity are rising and the number of Italians in work is back at pre-crisis levels. Italian banks appear to have escaped a financial meltdown, despite being saddled with around 175 billion euros of bad loans.  Previous prime ministers have pushed through some reforms. Mario Monti overhauled pensions in 2011 while Matteo Renzi overcame a long-held taboo by partly liberalising labour laws. The insolvency code has also been simplified. However, Italy is still grappling with hefty debt and a byzantine administrative system.  None of the key political parties is offering solutions to lower the country\u2019s public debt, which at 132 percent of GDP is the highest in the European Union after Greece. Pre-electoral promises could make the problem worse: 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio wants to introduce a universal basic income, while Berlusconi is offering to raise the minimum pension to 1,000 euros a month. Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party and the Northern League are promising tax cuts.  The parties are also skirting Italy\u2019s dysfunctional bureaucracy and complex legal system - the biggest hurdle to luring capital. While well-run cities like Milan are attracting investment and high-value employees, the south struggles with unacceptably high levels of unemployment, poverty and crime.  The worry is that Italians disillusioned by their current political class turn away from elections. Turnout for national polls is falling towards 70 percent, from close to 90 percent 25 years ago. In recent regional elections in Sicily, less than half of the voters cast a ballot. If that trend is replicated on a national scale, apathy could be the election\u2019s unwelcome winner.

          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong bankers are eyeing a slew of blockbuster IPOs from Chinese technology firms with a total market capitalization of some $500 billion over the next two years, in a sharp contrast to 2017 - the city\u2019s worst year for raising equity in a decade.  If bankers\u2019 expectations are met, it would set up Hong Kong for a showdown with New York, the traditional host for the world\u2019s hottest new-economy companies and Hong Kong\u2019s closest rival for the global IPO crown.  Companies such as smartphone maker Xiaomi [IPO-XMGP.HK] and wealth management platform Lufax are among those mulling multi-billion dollar listings in Hong Kong next year, encouraged by a late-2017 rush of tech floats.  Bankers estimate Xiaomi\u2019s IPO could value the company at up to $100 billion, while Lufax was valued at $18.5 billion in its last funding round.  \u201cThe expectation is that over the next couple of years there is probably upwards of $500 billion of market capitalization just in the tech sector in China that could go public,\u201d said Tucker Highfield, head of equity capital markets syndicate for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse.  Some firms will still head to New York, whose acceptance of dual-class share structures is attractive for many technology companies. Meituan-Dianping, a Chinese online platform for ordering food and booking movies, is expected to choose New York for a float that could raise $3 billion.   But Hong Kong, the world\u2019s biggest equity capital-raising center for four of the last 10 years, is looking to revive its appeal and this month announced plans to allow dual-class shares as it tries to attract Chinese tech listings.  Hong Kong raised $32.8 billion in equity capital in 2017, Thomson Reuters data shows, the lowest since 2008 when fundraising dried up during the global financial crisis.   Of this, IPOs accounted for $10.9 billion or just more than half 2016 levels, leaving Hong Kong ranking fourth globally for 2017, behind the New York Stock Exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange and Mumbai\u2019s National Stock Exchange.  Bankers and investors said the dominance of Wall Street in the first half of the year, when a series of record closes for benchmark indices grabbed headlines, distracted global investors from an even stronger rally in Asian emerging markets stocks.   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index .HSI has gained 35 percent this year - its best performance since 2009. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS has risen over 32 percent. [MKTS/GLOB]   The city was also hit by the timing of some giant floats, such as an IPO of up to $10 billion by China Tower, the world\u2019s largest collection of telecoms towers, that was expected in 2017 but is now seen happening in early 2018.      Spurring the current optimism are a series of recent hot tech floats. China Literature (0772.HK) raised $1.1 billion in November and jumped more than 80 percent on its debut - the best opening pop by any big IPO worldwide this year.   \u201cThe backlog is strong,\u201d said Aaron Arth, head of the financing group for Asia excluding Japan at Goldman Sachs.  \u201cThere are a number of big deals likely to come to market that are backed by strong business dynamics and exposure to China - all at a time when people are reallocating to the region,\u201d Arth added.  Equity-raising across Asia-Pacific slipped 2 percent this year to $236.3 billion, its lowest since 2013, as sales of additional equity by listed groups fell 14 percent.  Morgan Stanley (MS.N), UBS (UBSG.S) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) led the equity league tables for the region with $13.6 billion and $12.4 billion and $12.3 billion of deals to their credit respectively. Citic Securities (600030.SS) and Citigroup (C.N) rounded out the top five.   Reporting by Jennifer Hughes; Editing by Himani Sarkar"

          "title": "New drug approvals hit 21-year high in 2017",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. drug approvals hit a 21-year high in 2017, with 46 novel medicines winning a green light \u2014 more than double the previous year \u2014 while the figure also rose in the European Union.  The EU recommended 92 new drugs including generics, up from 81, and China laid out plans to speed up approvals in what is now the world\u2019s second biggest market behind the United States.  Yet the world\u2019s biggest drugmakers saw average returns on their research and development spending fall, reflecting more competitive pressures and the growing share of new products now coming from younger biotech companies.  Consultancy Deloitte said last month that projected returns at 12 of the world\u2019s top drugmakers were at an eight-year low of only 3.2 percent.  Many of the drugs receiving a green light in 2017 were for rare diseases and sub-types of cancer, which often target very small populations, although they can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. (tmsnrt.rs/2hGom21)  Significantly, the U.S. drug tally of 46 does not include the first of a new wave of cell and gene therapies from Novartis, Gilead Sciences and Spark Therapeutics that were approved in 2017 under a separate category.  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has hailed these products as \u201ca whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases\u201d. However, there is debate as to how cash-strapped healthcare systems will pay for them.  Under Gottlieb, the FDA has taken advantage of policy changes implemented in recent years to accelerate the drug approval process.   Procedures such as the agency\u2019s \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d designation have cut review times and helped to stimulate competition by adding multiple new drugs that often work in a similar way.   A wide choice of medicines with the same mechanism of action can be a double-edged sword for manufacturers, since it gives insurers and governments ammunition to drive down prices.  Pfizer and Merck\u2019s new diabetes drug Steglatro, for example, was the fourth product of its kind to win a green light in the United States, while Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic was the sixth of its type. Both were approved in December.   In cancer, AstraZeneca\u2019s Imfinzi was the fifth medicine to target a key protein found on the body\u2019s immune cells when it won approval last May.  For the current year, companies have more new products waiting in the wings, although the pace of FDA approvals may be tempered by the fact that several drugs that had been expected to be cleared in the first quarter of 2018 were actually approved in 2017.  In Europe, meanwhile, the focus will be on any disruption or delays to the approval process as the European Medicines Agency prepares to relocate from London to Amsterdam as a result of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.

          "body": "SIDON, Lebanon (Reuters) - A prominent Palestinian militant whose followers have fought other factions in a refugee camp in Lebanon has traveled to Syria, he said, removing one of the main combatants in one of Lebanon\u2019s most volatile settlements.  A statement by Bilal Badr, who led a hardline Sunni Islamist faction against mainstream Palestinian groups in the Ain el-Hilweh refugee camp at Sidon, did not say when or how he had traveled to Syria.   The rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad has drawn militant Sunnis from across the region. After fighting in Ain el-Hilweh in August, Palestinian groups urged wanted security suspects to leave the camp.   Badr\u2019s statement addressed his supporters \u201cfrom the land of jihad and glory, from Assad\u2019s lair in Syria, to which we migrated to support the religion of God\u201d.   The statement was circulated on social media inside the camp and its authenticity was confirmed by a source close to Badr.   Although his statement revealed his presence in Syria, it was issued to thank followers for helping his wife, who had been briefly detained, rather than to describe his whereabouts.  Islamist sources in Ain el-Hilweh said Badr had gone to Idlib province which borders Turkey in northwest Syria and is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance spearheaded by the former al Qaeda affiliate in the country.   Badr fighters have repeatedly battled the mainstream Fatah and other factions in Ain el-Hilweh, leading to more than a dozen deaths in 2017.   Lebanon\u2019s Palestinian camps mainly fall outside the jurisdiction of the Lebanese security forces. There are 170,000 Palestinian refugees living in 12 camps in Lebanon, according to a recent census announced by Lebanese authorities.   Writing by Angus McDowall, Editing by William Maclean"

          "body": "MUMBAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - India\u2019s gold imports surged 67 percent in 2017 from the previous year to 855 tonnes as jewellers replenished inventory amid a rebound in retail demand, provisional data from precious metals consultancy GFMS showed.  The rebound in purchases by India, the world\u2019s second-biggest consumer of gold after China, could support global prices, which are already near their highest levels in three months. Spot gold values gained more than 13 percent last year, their best annual performance since 2010.  \u201cJewellers were replenishing inventory in the first half of 2017 after demonetization in the last quarter of 2016,\u201d Sudheesh Nambiath, a senior analyst with GFMS, a division of Thomson Reuters, said on Tuesday.  In November 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 500- and 1,000-rupee banknotes, which accounted for 86 percent of the value of cash in circulation, part of a crackdown on corruption, tax evasion and the financing of militant groups.  The move created a cash crunch and dampened gold purchases in the last quarter of 2016. As cash became available over 2017, jewellers and dealers started restocking bullion.  Good monsoon rains in 2017 also helped to revive farmers income and retail demand in rural areas, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bank.  Rural demand takes up two-thirds of India\u2019s total.  In mid-December, global gold prices fell to their lowest level in five months in anticipation of a hike in interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve.  \u201cThe price correction encouraged trading houses and banks to increase imports last month,\u201d said a Mumbai-based bullion dealer with a private bank.  The country\u2019s overseas gold purchases in December stood at 70 tonnes, up 40 percent from a year ago, GFMS data showed.  India\u2019s gold imports this month could be higher than last January\u2019s 50 tonnes, but lower than the December imports as demand has been softening due to the recent price rise, said the dealer in Mumbai.  Spot gold rose 0.6 percent to $1,310.48 an ounce at 1029 GMT, having hit its highest since Sept. 26 at $1,312.34 earlier in the session.  Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav; Editing by Tom Hogue"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Former world number one Andy Murray\u2019s lingering hip issues forced him to withdraw from the Brisbane International on Tuesday with the Briton admitting he was unsure whether he could recover in time for the Australian Open later this month.  Murray has not played a competitive match since a Wimbledon quarter-final loss last July due to the complaint and despite coming through a one-set exhibition in Abu Dhabi last week, he was unable to train on Tuesday and announced his withdrawal.  \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed to be withdrawing from the Brisbane International,\u201d Murray, seeded second in Brisbane, told tournament organizers before going into further detail of his predicament in an emotional post on social media.   \u201cHaving been recommended to treat my hip conservatively since the U.S. Open, I have done everything asked of me from a rehab perspective and worked extremely hard to try get back on the court competing,\u201d Murray said on his Instagram account.   \u201cHaving played practice sets here in Brisbane with some top players unfortunately this hasn\u2019t worked yet to get me to the level I would like so I have to reassess my options. Continuing rehab is one option and giving my hip more time to recover.  \u201cSurgery is also an option but the chances of a successful outcome are not as high as I would like which has made this my secondary option and my hope has been to avoid that. However, this is something I may have to consider but let\u2019s hope not.\u201d  The world number 16 had been due to play his first tournament match of the season on Thursday with a second-round encounter against American Ryan Harrison at Pat Rafter Arena. He will be replaced by German lucky loser Yannick Hanfmann.  Murray, who said on Sunday that he planned to trim his schedule in 2018 to prevent a recurrence of his injury issues, will remain in Brisbane for the rest of the week before planning his next move.  \u201cIn the short term I\u2019m going to be staying in Australia for the next couple of days to see if my hip settles down a bit and will decide by the weekend whether to stay out here or fly home to assess what I do next,\u201d the 30-year-old added.  \u201cSorry for the long post but I wanted to keep everyone in the loop and get this off my chest as it\u2019s really hurting inside.\u201d  Brisbane tournament director Cameron Pearson wished the three-times grand slam winner well.  \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed for Andy, as I know how much he was looking forward to getting his season started in Brisbane,\u201d he said.  \u201cAs a two-time former champion, he has great memories of playing on Pat Rafter Arena and thrilling his fans. I wish him all the best to be ready to play the Australian Open.\u201d  Murray\u2019s latest injury setback will also come as a blow to Australian Open organizers ahead of the year\u2019s first major in Melbourne starting on Jan. 15, along with those of fellow \u201cBig Four\u201d members Rafael Nadal (back) and Novak Djokovic (elbow).

The PBOC said in a statement published on Tuesday that it lent 476 billion yuan to financial institutions via its medium-term lending facility (MLF) in December.  Outstanding MLF was 4.5215 trillion yuan at the end of December compared with 4.4205 trillion yuan at the end of November, implying a net injection of 101 billion yuan last month.  The PBOC also extended 134.06 billion yuan of loans to local financial institutions in December via its standing lending facility (SLF), it said.

          "body": "LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Euro zone factories ended 2017 growing at their fastest pace in more than two decades while performance in Asia was more uneven, with its third-largest economy India leading the field and manufacturing giant China unexpectedly resilient.  With a similar business survey covering the United States forecast to be strong, the synchronized global growth that took hold last year looks set to continue based on the first major economic data releases of 2018.   Euro zone factory activity is handily outpacing its peers, including Britain. That has added to expectations that the European Central Bank, which this month will halve its monthly bond purchases, will shutter the program later this year.   \u201cThe euro zone manufacturing boom gained further momentum in December, rounding off the best year on record and setting the scene for a strong start to 2018,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the surveys.   The December euro zone final manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) was 60.6, matching an earlier preliminary reading, the highest since the survey began in June 1997. Any figure above 50 represents growth.  The euro rose to a three-month high above $1.20.  The factory output index, which feeds into a broader set of data including services due on Thursday, rose to 62.2 from 61.0 in November. That was its highest in over 17 years and a reading exceeded only once in the survey\u2019s more than two decades of history.  Germany and France, the euro zone\u2019s two largest economies look to be expanding in tandem, striking their highest manufacturing PMI numbers on record and for 17 years, respectively. But growth slowed in Italy, the bloc\u2019s third largest economy.  In Britain, which is in the process of negotiating a withdrawal from the European Union, growth tailed off sharply from a four-year high the previous month.  \u201cStrong growth will be hard to sustain in 2018,\u201d noted Samuel Tombs, UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. He pointed out that the UK PMI had underperformed the euro zone\u2019s by the most since June 2008.   \u201cBritish manufacturers ... are failing to make the most of the rebound in global trade,\u201d Tombs wrote.   Factory activity hit a five-year high in India and the best in 6-1/2 years in Taiwan, and also picked up in China. But activity contracted in South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia, a sign that regional interest rate hikes are likely to be gradual.  \u201cRobust external demand and accommodative domestic monetary policy should help keep Asian manufacturing sectors in good shape,\u201d said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics.  In China, manufacturing growth unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December amid a surge in new orders, suggesting continued strength in global trade.  The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 from 50.8 in November, and far outpaced expectations in a Reuters poll for a dip to 50.6.  The China PMI, which pushed Asian shares .MIAPJ0000PUS to their highest in a decade, was somewhat at odds with a much larger official China PMI survey on Sunday. It showed a slowdown in growth amid a crackdown on pollution and measures to curb risky financing and cool the housing market.  The difference, analysts say, stems from the fact that the Caixin/PMI index tracks smaller, private firms, more sensitive to exports.  China is expected to have grown by close to 7 percent in 2017, but the world\u2019s second largest economy is likely to slow in the new year on the back of those measures, highlighted as policy priorities at October\u2019s key Communist Party congress.  Beijing is expected to target 2018 growth of around 6.5 percent.  \u201cWe believe a moderate growth slowdown to be more visible in the first half of 2018, especially on the investment front, due mainly to the tight financial conditions and a cool down of the property market,\u201d BofA Merrill Lynch economists said.  China\u2019s slowdown means that for the rest of Asia, the pace of rate increases is unlikely to match that of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is likely to raise interest rates three times this year, and possibly more.  There will likely be \u201conly a few rate hikes here and there across the region over the coming two years,\u201d HSBC analysts wrote in a note, even as they expect Asian economies to keep chugging along in 2018, led by tech and trade.  India\u2019s PMI showed factory activity expanding at the fastest pace in five years, buoyed by a rise in output and new orders, which allowed firms to raise prices. The data firmed up views that interest rates in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy have probably bottomed.  PMIs for Japan, which surpassed growth expectations in 2017 on the back of the surging tech and trade cycle globally, will be released on Thursday.  The U.S. manufacturing PMI is due later on Tuesday.   Reporting by Jonathan Cable and Marius Zaharia; Editing by Ross Finley and Catherine Evans"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Caroline Wozniacki capped 2017 with the biggest win of her career when she claimed a maiden WTA Finals triumph in October and the Dane has carried that momentum into the new season with a ruthless display to kick off her Auckland Classic campaign.  The top seed has a chance to usurp world number one Simona Halep with a victory in New Zealand and the 27-year-old needed just 58 minutes to race past American Madison Brengle with a 6-3 6-0 triumph in their first round encounter on Tuesday.  The world number three is still searching for her first grand slam triumph but after emerging victorious in the elite eight-woman event in Singapore, her raised levels of play could see her make that breakthrough in Melbourne later this month.  Wozniacki is also searching for a first triumph in Auckland after reaching the final in 2015 and despite being tested by Brengle early the contest, the Dane pulled away once she found her rhythm and claimed the last seven games to seal victory.  \u201cI thought I played pretty well, especially considering it\u2019s the first match back of the year,\u201d Wozniacki told reporters. \u201cIt took me a couple of games to kind of just get the rhythm and then I started playing better and better.  \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get my legs moving, trying to make the right decisions, wait for the right shots to play aggressive and go for it, and find the right balance of offense and defense.\u201d  The win set up a second round encounter against Croatia\u2019s Petra Martic, who overcame Czech player Marketa Vondrousova 7-6(2) 6-3 in their first round tie to advance.  Elsewhere, former world number two and 2013 Auckland champion Agnieszka Radwanska was forced to dig deep to remain on a semi-final collision course with Wozniacki when the Pole eked out a 6-2 4-6 6-2 victory over Brazil\u2019s Beatriz Haddad Maia.  \u201cI\u2019m just very happy to win my first match of 2018, and I think it was good timing to come back and do it here in Auckland after five years,\u201d Radwanska, who has seen her ranking drop to 28th after a poor 2017, said in her on-court interview.  Third seed Barbora Strycova was also taken the distance in her first round encounter against Italy\u2019s Sara Errani, the Czech emerging with a 6-4 6-7(3) 6-4 victory to set up a second round tie against Sweden\u2019s Johanna Larsson.  The day did not pass without three upsets, however, with defending champion and fifth seed Lauren Davis losing 6-1 6-2 to fellow American Sachia Vickery, while sixth seed Yulia Putintseva and seventh seed Mona Barthel both suffered straight set losses.  The Australian Open is the first grand slam of the season and runs from Jan 15-28 in Melbourne.  Reporting by John O'Brien in Singapore; editing by Sudipto Ganguly"

          "body": "* Asia shares ex-Japan cheered by upbeat China survey  * Dollar downtrodden after suffering worst year since 2003  * Commodities benefit from dollar weakness, China demand  * Oil prices hover near highest since mid-2015  * European shares squeeze down by currency strength  By Marc Jones  LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The ailing dollar fell to its lowest in over three months on Tuesday, while surprisingly upbeat Chinese manufacturing data ensured there was no serious new year hangover for world shares despite a groggy start for Europe.  Sentiment was also helped by news that North Korea had offered an olive branch to South Korea, with Kim Jong Un saying he was \u201copen to dialogue\u201d with Seoul.  MSCI's broadest index of world shares climbed 0.15 percent, having set scores of record highs and risen by one-fifth in value last year alone. reut.rs/2zLv6kT  The driver had again been Asia and its emerging markets.  Shanghai blue chips climbed 1.4 percent and MSCIs 24-country EM index jumped over 1 percent after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline.  The reading pointed to resilience in the world\u2019s second-largest economy even as Beijing cracks down on industrial pollution and engineers a cooling property market.  \u201cManufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,\u201d said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.  In currency markets, the dollar remained out of favour having already hit a three-month low against a basket of its peers on Friday. That brought its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worse performance since 2003.  Its pain was the euro\u2019s gain though, with the single currency enjoying its strongest year against the dollar in 14 years.  On Tuesday, it jetted to a three-month top of $1.2045 as data showed that euro zone manufacturers had ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.  It had already sliced through major resistance on the yen in Asia too, reaching highs not seen since late 2015 at 135.45 yen .  \u201cForward-looking indicators bode well for the new year,\u201d Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit which compiled the manufacturing data, pointing to a near record pace of new orders and job creation.  The pound, Swiss franc and scandinavian currencies were also up solidly against the dollar.  That combined with a two-month high in bond yields in Germany and Italy, two of the euro zone\u2019s biggest debt markets, pushed stock markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris 0.3-0.6 percent into the red.  A major hurdle for the U.S. currency will be Wednesday\u2019s release of minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting when it raised interest rates. Two policymakers voted against the move amid doubts inflation would accelerate as hoped.  With the market now pricing in a 68 percent chance of a March hike and two hikes for 2018, there will be close inspection to assess just how shaky their confidence is for any pick-up in inflationary trends said Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at broker IG in Sydney.  \u201cThat said, the U.S. dollar is underloved and oversold and it won\u2019t take much to promote a bout of profit-taking from the shorts.\u201d  The skid in the dollar, combined with strength in Chinese demand, has benefited commodities priced into the currency.  Copper dipped back a little on Tuesday to $7,223.50 a tonne, but that follows a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top. Aluminium amassed gains of 34 percent.  Gold was 0.37 percent firmer at $1,310 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.  Brent crude oil futures ended the year with a 17 percent rise, while U.S. crude climbed 12 percent on strong demand and declining global inventories.  On Tuesday, Brent dipped a few cents at $66.85 a barrel, while U.S. crude firmed 3 cents to $60.47.  Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney; Editing by\nMatthew Mpoke Bigg"

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian IPO fundraising could double this year to around A$10 billion ($7.84 billion) from five-year lows in 2017, with firms such as Deutsche Bank-backed Latitude Financial poised to capitalize on rallying markets and investor craving for big deals.    Bankers around the world are looking to the global stock market rally of the past year to kick-start a series of big floats and spin-offs, following years of caution and balance sheet repair by companies that led to a lackluster market for initial public offerings (IPOs).  New floats in Sydney last year raised just $3.9 billion - the lowest since 2012, Thomson Reuters data shows as debt-fuelled foreign buyers snapped up companies that could otherwise have pursued a listing.   \u201cWe could reach the A$8 billion to A$10 billion mark,\u201d said Richard Sleijpen, UBS head of equity capital markets, of the 2018 pipeline. \u201cSpeculated, announced and strategic review processes suggest very strong IPO volumes for this year.\u201d  Expected deals include mortgage provider Latitude Financial,  partly owned by Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and KKR & Co. LP (KKR.N). The company is valued at about A$5 billion and last month appointed lead managers to help raise about A$2 billion, according to two sources who declined to be identified because the plans are private.  Latitude\u2019s senior executives did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment on the company\u2019s IPO plans. Group Treasurer Paul Varro did not immediately return a voice message left after office hours.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (CBA.AX) is also considering an IPO of its asset management business - Colonial First State Global Asset Management (CFSGAM) - as part of a series of divestments. It sold its insurance unit to AIA Group (1299.HK) in September.   CFSGAM has A$219 billion in assets under management and could be listed to raise about A$3 billion this year, the sources said.   Vodafone Group (VOD.L) is also planning to spin off its New Zealand subsidiary in a deal expected to raise about A$1 billion, the sources added.  CBA and Vodafone have said previously they are exploring listing their units. A Vodafone spokeswoman said on Tuesday no final decision had been taken on an IPO for the New Zealand unit. A CBA spokesman said the bank continued to review its options for the unit but declined to confirm the size of the potential float.   \u201cThe investment community has been starved of IPOs of well established businesses - that is one of the main reasons why we see a very strong demand for listings in 2018,\u201d said one senior banker who declined to be identified because the banker was not authorized to speak with the media.  Origin Energy Ltd (ORG.AX) sold its gas assets to Beach Energy for $1.25 billion, after actively exploring a listing of the business last year.  Another disappointment came from TPG Capital Management which was working towards a listing of Alinta Energy but opted to sell to Hong Kong conglomerate Chow Tai Fook Enterprises for nearly A$4 billion.   UBS\u2019s Sleijpen said that in some cases last year, the sellers viewed outright sales as more certain than the IPO market, but added that equity market dynamics had changed.   \u201cInvestor sentiment is quite bullish going into 2018, and that has been fueled by a more stable market \u2013 as we haven\u2019t seen the kind of volatility that we saw leading into 2017 \u2013 and the prospect of synchronized global growth, where most economies are in a reasonably good position to continue to grow this year,\u201d he said.  Australia\u2019s ASX 200  rose 7 per cent last year, its best performance since 2013, as a surge in commodity prices lifted miners, helping offset a subdued performance by the country\u2019s biggest banks and insurers.

          "body": "HELSINKI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Department store chain Stockmann is planning to sell a well known building in Helsinki, which has an estimated book value of around 100 million euros ($120 million), to cash in on a booming market for commercial property in the Finnish capital.  A possible sale of the \u201cBook House\u201d in the heart of Helsinki \u2014 together with a long-planned property sale in St Petersburg \u2014 would help the indebted company which posted a core quarterly loss for the third quarter.  In November, Stockmann put its real estate assets including the \u201cBook House\u201d forward as collateral for a new refinancing package.  \u201cValues in Helsinki are record high at the moment, and as we don\u2019t practise retail business in this property any longer, we will start investigating a possible divestment,\u201d said Bjorn Teir, Director for Real Estate at Stockmann.  Teir did not give a book value for the Book House, designed by architect Alvar Aalto and built in 1969. Analyst Sauli Vilen from research firm Inderes gave a rough estimate of around 100 million euros.  Stockmann used to sell books there itself but sold that business to Sweden\u2019s Bonnier in 2015.  Shares in the company, which fell about 40 percent last year, were up 5.2 percent at 4.58 euros by 0915 GMT.  Stockmann has been negotiating with investment company O1 Group on the sale of its St Petersburg department store property, which has a book value of 181 million euros. The process continues, Stockmann said.  The total fair value of Stockmann\u2019s real estate assets is 950 million euros, the majority of which is estimated to be made up of the company\u2019s Helsinki flagship department store.  The company, known for its premium department stores, has struggled in recent years due to slowdowns in Finland and Russia as well as a consumer shift to online shopping.

At 0920 GMT, Britain\u2019s FTSE index was down 0.3 percent, in line with European peers on the first trading day of the year after a record-setting 2017.  Small caps, more focused on the domestic economy and therefore less vulnerable to a stronger pound, gained 0.1 percent.  Rio Tinto was the worst performer, losing 2 percent while other miners including Antofagasta and BHP Billiton fell 1.7 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively.  Glencore lost 0.8 percent after it agreed to sell an Australian coal mines to British industrialist Sanjeev Gupta\u2019s GFG Alliance for an undisclosed sum.  British carmakers were also sharply down, losing 1.7 percent. Europe-wide, the sector fell about 2 percent on weak December data from France, a trader said.  Energy group BP was down 0.5 percent after it said it expected a positive impact on future post-tax earnings from the U.S. tax overhaul, but also a one-off non-cash charge of about $1.5 billion on fourth-quarter results.  \u201cWhilst there is always the chance that the necessary hit turns out to be more, you would imagine the company has been conservative, meaning more likelihood that it in fact turns out to be less,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which said last week it would also take a one-off hit but benefit over the long term from the overhaul, lost 1 percent.  Compass Group < CPG.L> was little changed, shedding 0.2 percent after world\u2019s biggest catering firm\u2019s outgoing CEO died in a plane crash on New Year\u2019s Eve.  In the airline industry, British Airways\u2019 owner IAG added 1.5 percent after it agreed to buy Niki, Air Berlin\u2019s insolvent Austrian holiday airline, for 20 million euros.  BBA Aviation retreated 0.5  percent after the group \u200dappointed a new chief executive. (reporting by Julien Ponthus; editing by John Stonestreet)"

          "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil production has continued to grow in 2017, with average daily output at a 30-year high of 10.98 million barrels per day, though the pace of growth slowed from 2016 because of the country\u2019s participation in an OPEC-led global supply pact.  The Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other leading oil producers agreed to cut their combined oil production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from the start of 2017 to prop up prices.  Russia said it would cut its output by 300,000 bpd from the 30-year monthly high of 11.247 million bpd hit in October 2016 and achieved the targeted cut by the second quarter.  OPEC and Russia have subsequently agreed to extend the cuts for the whole of 2018.  Russian energy ministry data showed that oil and gas condensate production stood at 10.95 million bpd in December, up from 10.94 million bpd in November.  In tonnes, oil output rose to 46.322 million last month from 44.782 million in November, lifted by a 0.2 percent rise in output at leading oil company Rosneft  For the whole of 2017, the average output of 10.98 million bpd compared with 10.96 million bpd in 2016 and 10.72 million bpd in 2015.  In tonnes, Russian oil output reached 546.8 million last year, against 547.5 million tonnes in 2016, which was one day longer. Reuters uses the barrel to tonnes ratio of 7.33 to 1.  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak has said that 2018 oil production is expected to stay at 547 million tonnes if the cuts last until the end of the year, as agreed.  \u201cOutput is likely to hold around current levels following the recent decision by OPEC and non-OPEC producers to extend the cuts to the end of 2018,\u201d the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its December review.  Oil markets have been supported by a year of production cuts and strong demand from China. For 2017, the oil price has risen by 20 percent to about $67 a barrel.  Only rising U.S. production, which is on the verge of breaking through 10 million bpd, is weighing on the price outlook for 2018.  Natural gas production in Russia was at 63.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) last month, versus 60.6 bcm in November.  Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by David Goodman"

          "body": "* North Korea calls for reduced tensions with South  * South says inter-Korean relations tied to nuclear dispute  * Weapons tests likely to continue despite overtures  * For multimedia coverage of North Korea: www.reuters.com/north-korea/ (Adds new graphic and link)  By Josh Smith and David Brunnstrom  SEOUL/WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - After a year of threats and weapons advances, North Korea\u2019s leader appears to be using the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in South Korea as a tool to blunt growing international pressure on his regime while leaving his nuclear arsenal untouched.  Kim Jong Un, in his annual New Year\u2019s Day speech, called for reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and flagged the North\u2019s possible participation in the Games next month, just across the border in Pyeongchang.  South Korea has been eager to involve North Korea to ensure the Games are not disrupted by any further nuclear or missile tests and as a way of re-establishing dialogue with the reclusive state.  Analysts say Kim\u2019s gambit is aimed at driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington, which has advocated a strategy of maximum pressure and insisted that all options, including military ones, are on the table.  But the move also targets the broader international consensus involving major players China, Russia and Japan that has tightened sanctions and deepened isolation for North Korea in recent months.  \u201cA major part of the Kim family playbook is to exploit and to widen the divergences in the interests, in the first instance between the U.S. and South Korea, but more broadly among the five major neighbours,\u201d said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until last April and now at the Asia Society Policy Institute.  North Korea has long followed such a strategy of intense provocations followed by conciliatory phases aimed at exposing rifts, he said.  \u201cThis is a classic united we stand, divided we fall situation,\u201d Russel said. \u201cIt\u2019s always easier to maintain five party solidarity when North Korea is behaving badly.\u201d  U.S. President Donald Trump has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea as it seeks to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.  Washington says the full cooperation of China, Russia and other countries is vital to the success of this effort, which includes significant restrictions on trade and other ties with North Korea.  China, which remains North Korea\u2019s major partner, has curtailed trade in line with United Nations sanctions, but Washington has called for it to do more to isolate Pyongyang.  South Korea\u2019s government publicly welcomed Kim\u2019s overture, and President Moon Jae-in has pushed to ease tensions ahead of the Games by postponing joint military drills with American troops until after the Olympics.  Moon also said on Tuesday the improvement of inter-Korean ties was linked to resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme.  The White House has yet to make a detailed response. However, powerful Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the United States would boycott the Games if North Korea attends.  \u201cAllowing Kim Jong Un\u2019s North Korea to participate in Winter Olympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet,\u201d Graham said on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m confident South Korea will reject this absurd overture and fully believe that if North Korea goes to the Winter Olympics, we do not.\u201d  Graham unsuccessfully called for a boycott of the previous Winter Olympics in Sochi over Russia\u2019s granting of asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden.  The spectacle of North Korean athletes and officials participating in Olympic events may create some awkward moments for international leaders who have spent months painting the country as a pariah state, said Robert Kelly, a professor at South Korea\u2019s Pusan National University.  \u201cIt puts the South Koreans in a weird position because it potentially creates tension between U.S. and Japan who have gone to lengths to isolate the regime,\u201d he said.  Japan\u2019s relationship with South Korea is already seen as under some strain, with one former Japanese diplomat saying Tokyo was suffering from \u201cfatigue\u201d with Seoul and lacking confidence in Moon.  Still, analysts were sceptical Kim\u2019s gambit would do lasting damage to the alliance between Seoul and Washington, or to the international push for sanctions.  \u201cI doubt that there will be a substantial reversal in global economic and political isolation measures in the near term,\u201d said Scott Snyder, director of U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.  At the heart of analysts\u2019 scepticism is Kim\u2019s apparent lack of appetite for compromise on the main points of nuclear weapons, missile testing, or human rights.  \u201cParticipation in things like the Olympics are pseudo-concessions, because the North doesn\u2019t actually have to give up anything,\u201d Kelly said.  In his speech, Kim vowed he would spend 2018 \u201cmass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles\u201d to \u201cgive a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action.\u201d  That means further missile tests are almost certain, with more focus on \u201crealistic\u201d exercises than developmental tests, said Joshua Pollack, a senior researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.  \u201cThe major theme here for strategic forces is shifting from development to serial production, deployment, and increased readiness,\u201d he said.  If the United States wants to take advantage of any possible easing in tensions, it needs to drop its demands for a halt in testing as a precondition for talks, said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project in New York.  \u201cThe most important reciprocal step would be to scale back - not (just) postpone - the spring joint exercises,\u201d he said. \u201cFailure to try these steps will only ensure that unbridled North Korean weapons development continues.\u201d  Reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington and Josh Smith in Seoul; Additional reporting by Linda Sieg in Tokyo; Editing by Lincoln Feast"

In March, the U.S. government awarded a contract to AT&T to build the network, years after a federal commission recommended setting up such a system following the 9/11 attacks.  The No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier will receive 20 megahertz of wireless airwaves and success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years as part of the project known as FirstNet. AT&T expects to spend about $40 billion over 25 years to build and maintain the network.  States had until Thursday to opt out of AT&T\u2019s network and build their own public safety networks. In addition to the states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands also opted for FirstNet, AT&T said. Decisions from the three Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam and Northern Mariana Islands are not due until March 12, 2018.   Wall Street analysts have said FirstNet is a way for AT&T to add to its portfolio of wireless airwaves, or spectrum, at a time when consumers are using more data on their cell phones. The company can use the spectrum it receives from the U.S. government to provide more network capacity for wireless customers when it is not in use by emergency responders.

          "body": "* Euro\u2019s 2-1/2 peak against dollar within sights  * Commodity currencies rally again  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Tommy Wilkes  LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The euro climbed to a four-month high against a broadly weaker dollar on Tuesday, the first trading day of 2018, on optimism over a brightening economic picture in the euro zone.  It finished 2017 with its best year against the dollar since 2003 as European economies strengthened and expectations the European Central bank will wind down its monetary stimulus grew, boosting demand for the single currency.  The euro started the year by adding to those gains, climbing 0.3 percent to $1.2046 at 0839 GMT, within sights of the $1.2092 it hit in September, the highest since early 2015.  The single currency was also higher against the Japanese yen at 135.64, reaching levels not seen since late 2015.  Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London, said the end of a dollar funding squeeze typical of December, as well as a rally in commodity prices, had reduced demand for dollars since the holiday season, but the euro was also gaining because of the better economic performance of its member states.  \u201cFundamentally, what is helping the euro is the brightening economic outlook in the euro area. The momentum should continue,\u201d he said.  Euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high.  Tan said Societe Generale forecasts the euro will strengthen to $1.25 by the middle of the year.  The dollar\u2019s index against a basket of six major currencies slipped to 91.932, its weakest level since September.  For the whole of 2017, the dollar index slid more than 9.8 percent, the greenback\u2019s worst annual performance since 2003.  Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore, said a drop in the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield toward the end of 2017 was helping to weigh on the U.S. dollar.  With the dollar on the defensive, emerging Asian currencies clawed higher. The Chinese yuan rose to as high as 6.4922 yuan per dollar, its highest level since Sept. 8.  Commodity currencies traded higher after a rally in metal and oil prices and the Australian dollar gained another 0.4 percent to reach $0.7836, its highest level since October.  Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known digital currency, was flat at $13,496 after earlier falling 2.0 percent on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.  Bitcoin soared in 2017, gaining more than 1,300 percent for the year, although it fell at the end of December from its peak.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades, a survey showed on Tuesday, and rising demand suggests they will start the new year on a high.  The bloc\u2019s economy outpaced its peers last year, and the European Central Bank plans to scale back its stimulus program from this month.  IHS Markit\u2019s December final manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for the bloc was 60.6, matching an earlier preliminary reading and above November\u2019s 60.1. That was the highest since the survey began in June 1997.  An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday and seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to 62.2 from November\u2019s 61.0 - its highest in over 17 years and has only been above that once in the survey\u2019s history.  \u201cThe euro zone manufacturing boom gained further momentum in December, rounding off the best year on record and setting the scene for a strong start to 2018,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.  \u201cForward-looking indicators bode well for the new year: new orders rose at a near-record pace, while purchasing growth hit a new peak as firms readied themselves for higher production.  Meanwhile, job creation was maintained at November\u2019s record pace.\u201d  Despite factories raising prices again last month, albeit at a slightly weaker rate than in November, an index measuring new orders nudged up to 61.5 from 61.4, a level not seen since around the start of the century.  Inflation was 1.5 percent in November, below the ECB\u2019s 2 percent target ceiling, but the central bank announced in October it will halve its monthly asset purchases to 30 billion euros from January.  A majority of economists in a Reuters poll last year said they thought the ECB should shut the door on the program in September, but they were split on whether it actually would.

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German factories shifted into overdrive in December as strong foreign demand propelled growth in activity to a record high and capacity constraints led to the biggest delivery delays in more than 20 years, a survey showed on Tuesday.  IHS Markit\u2019s Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a quarter of the economy, jumped to an all-time high of 63.3 from 62.5 in the previous month.  The final figure, unchanged from the initial flash reading, was far above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction, as Europe\u2019s largest economy ended 2017 on an unusually strong footing.  \u201cTwenty-seventeen was a record-breaking year for the German manufacturing sector,\u201d IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.  Smith said the PMI not only posted the highest reading ever recorded since the survey began in 1996, but its current 37-month sequence of improving business conditions also beat the previous record set in the runup to the financial crisis.  \u201cThe goods-producing economy carries strong momentum into 2018, with new order growth at its highest for almost eight years and rising backlogs of work pointing to the need for further expansion in capacity,\u201d Smith added.  The PMI showed steep increases in output, new orders and exports. The level of new contracts received from abroad - mainly from Asia, the United States and Europe - rose at the fastest rate in the history of the survey.  Higher prices for raw materials such as steel and other metals pushed up input costs in December, and this in turn led to another push up in prices charged by manufacturers, the data showed.  \u201cA lingering concern is that supply-side constraints pose a risk to the sector\u2019s ability to kick on,\u201d Smith said, adding that huge delivery delays would inevitably be borne out by sustained upward pressure on input costs.

Europe\u2019s second-largest gas supplier after Russia exported 116 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas via pipelines to receiving terminals in Britain, Germany, France and Belgium last year, up from the previous record of 108.6 bcm in 2016.  Norway\u2019s pipeline gas exports meet about a quarter of Europe\u2019s demand.  Analysts said Norway\u2019s export levels in 2017 were boosted by low summer maintenance at the country\u2019s offshore gas fields, and higher output from its largest field, Troll.  More than 40 percent of all exports went to terminals in Germany, and over 30 percent to Britain, with the rest shared between France and Belgium.  The highest daily delivery in 2017 stood at 365.3 million cubic meters, the preliminary data showed.  Norwegian authorities increased Troll\u2019s production quota to 36 billion cubic meters from Oct. 1, 2017 until Sept. 30, 2018, up from 33 bcm for the previous 12 months, its operator Statoil has said.  Norway\u2019s annual export of gas to Europe has held at over 100 billion cubic meters each year since 2012, Gassco\u2019s data showed.  Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis, editing by Terje Solsvik"

The price of the German baseload power contract for the coming week rose by close to 70 percent from the previous session to 43.30 euros ($52.11) per megawatt hour (MWh), while the French equivalent jumped by 60 percent to 60 euros.  Thomson Reuters data showed that demand in Germany is expected to average 68.5 gigawatts (GW) next week, compared with 67.6 GW expected for Tuesday. In temperature-sensitive France, demand is forecast to jump to 71 GW next week from 60.3 GW on Tuesday.

          "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is expected to keep the February price for Arab Light crude steady, close to the highest in more than three years, while lowering prices for medium and heavy grades, a survey by Reuters showed on Tuesday.  Robust spot crude demand and stronger margins for middle distillates will underpin Saudi crude prices, but the producer was unlikely to raise prices further as Asia\u2019s \u201cdemand is expected to fall because of spring maintenance\u201d, one of the four respondents said in the survey.   The official selling price (OSP) for Saudi\u2019s flagship Arab Light crude could pause in February, after rising in January for the fifth straight month to its highest since September 2014, the survey showed.  Backwardation between first and third month cash Dubai was relatively unchanged in December from the previous month, the respondents said. In a backwardated market, prompt prices are higher than those in future months, indicating strong demand for immediate supplies.   A widening of Brent\u2019s premium to Dubai reduced arbitrage supplies from the Atlantic Basin and spurred Asia\u2019s demand for Middle East and Russian crude, pushing spot premiums for these grades in February to multi-month highs.   Still, Saudi Aramco could trim February prices for Arab Medium and Arab Heavy on weaker returns from fuel oil production, the respondents said. The average fuel oil margins in Asia fell about 50 percent in December from the previous month, Reuters data showed. Saudi crude OSPs are usually released around the fifth of each month, and set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude bound for Asia.   Saudi Aramco sets its crude prices based on recommendations from customers and after calculating the change in the value of its oil over the past month, based on yields and product prices.  Saudi Aramco officials as a matter of policy do not comment on the kingdom\u2019s monthly OSPs.   Reporting by Florence Tan; Editing by Tom Hogue"

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - European stocks faltered at the start of the trading year on Tuesday as an impressive run-up in metals and mining stocks reversed, while strength in oil companies and banks was not enough to stop the slide.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index dipped 0.2 percent in early deals, while euro zone stocks fell 0.3 percent.  Basic resources stocks weighed the most, with the sector index down 0.6 percent. Rio Tinto, BASF and BHP Billiton all fell.  The mining sector had surged to a five-year high at the end of last week, riding a wave of rising copper and other base metal prices, but Tuesday\u2019s dip suggested investors were taking profits after a strong run.  Oil, which marked its highest start to the trading year since 2014, supported benchmarks with oil majors across the region rising in concert with crude. Statoil and Total were among the strongest gainers.  Financials also rose with Santander and Unicredit among top banking stocks.  In other eye-catching moves, Lufthansa slipped 6.3 percent after British Airways owner IAG agreed to buy Air Berlin\u2019s insolvent Austrian airline Niki.  The German carrier had backed out of a deal to buy Niki\u2019s assets in mid-December due to competition concerns.  Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff surged 12 percent to the top of the STOXX, despite the firm saying its 2015 results would also have to be restated. The company also said its internal review of accounting irregularities was progressing.  Broker moves also drove trading: an upgrade to \u201cbuy\u201d from Sydbank sent Vestas Wind up 2.7 percent after the company secured several new orders.

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian protesters attacked police stations late into the night on Monday, news agency and social media reports said, as security forces struggled to contain the boldest challenge to the clerical leadership since unrest in 2009.  Videos on social media showed an intense clash in the central town of Qahderijan between security forces and protesters who were trying to occupy a police station, which was partially set ablaze. There were unconfirmed reports of several casualties among demonstrators.  In the western city of Kermanshah, protesters set fire to a traffic police post, but no one was hurt in the incident, Mehr news agency said.  Demonstrations continued for a fifth day. Some 13 people were reported killed on Sunday in the worst wave of unrest since crowds took to the streets in 2009 to condemn the re-election of then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  The protests have put pressure on the clerical leaders in power since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. President Hassan Rouhani made a televised call for calm on Sunday, saying Iranians had the right to criticize but must not cause unrest.  In the central city of Najafabad, a demonstrator opened fire on police with a hunting rifle, killing one and wounding three others, state television said.    Earlier, state TV said armed demonstrators on Sunday had tried to seize police and military bases but were stopped by \u201cstrong resistance from security forces.\u201d It gave no further details and there was no independent confirmation.  State TV had reported that 10 people were killed in protests on Sunday. On Monday, that death toll rose when the deputy governor of the western Hamadan Province, Saeed Shahrokhi, told ISNA news agency that another three protesters were killed on Sunday in the city of Tuyserkan.  Hundreds have been arrested, according to officials and social media. Online video showed police in the capital Tehran firing water cannon to disperse demonstrators, in footage said to have been filmed on Sunday.       Protests against economic hardships and alleged corruption erupted in Iran\u2019s second city of Mashhad on Thursday and escalated across the country into calls for the religious establishment to step down.     Some of the anger was directed at Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, breaking a taboo surrounding the man who has been supreme leader of Iran since 1989.  Video posted on social media showed crowds of people walking through the streets, some chanting \u201cDeath to the dictator!\u201d Reuters was not immediately able to verify the footage. The Fars news agency reported \u201cscattered groups\u201d of protesters in Tehran on Monday and said a ringleader had been arrested.   \u201cThe government will show no tolerance for those who damage public property, violate public order and create unrest in society,\u201d Rouhani said in his address on Sunday.   Unsigned statements on social media urged Iranians to continue to demonstrate in 50 towns and cities.  The government said it was temporarily restricting access to the Telegram messaging app and Instagram. There were reports that internet mobile access was blocked in some areas.         Iran is a major OPEC oil producer and regional power deeply involved in Syria and Iraq as part of a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia. Many Iranians resent those foreign interventions, and want their leaders to create jobs at home, where youth unemployment reached 28.8 percent last year.  Among reported fatalities, two people were shot dead in the southwestern town of Izeh on Sunday and several others were injured, ILNA news agency quoted a member of parliament as saying.   \u201cI do not know whether yesterday\u2019s shooting was done by rally participants or the police and this issue is being investigated,\u201d Hedayatollah Khademi was quoted as saying.  Regional governor Mostafa Samali told Fars that only one person was killed in an incident unrelated to the protests, and the suspected shooter had been arrested.  Almost nine years since the \u201cGreen movement\u201d reformist protests were crushed by the state, Iran\u2019s adversaries voiced their support for the resurgence of anti-government sentiment.   U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cThe great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!\u201d   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the \u201cbrave Iranians\u201d taking to streets to protest a regime that \u201cwastes tens of billions of dollars spreading hate\u201d.   \u201cI wish the Iranian people success in their noble quest for freedom,\u201d he said in a video posted on his Facebook page.  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel urged \u201call sides (to) refrain from violent actions\u201d.  Reporting by Dubai newsroom; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Robin Pomeroy and David Gregorio"

Benoit Coeure, the Frenchman in charge of carrying out the European Central Bank\u2019s bond purchases, sees \u201ca reasonable chance\u201d the 2.55 trillion euro stimulus programme will not be extended again when it expires in September, he told a Chinese financial magazine at the weekend.  The comments highlight that the days of extraordinary monetary stimulus are nearing an end given stronger economic conditions and signs of a pick-up in inflation.  Data on Friday showed inflation in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, hit its highest level in five years in 2017.  ECB monthly bond purchases, which have long underpinned low borrowing costs, have fallen to 30 billion euros from 60 billion euros.  That cut in purchases from the start of January, unveiled last year, comes just as investors brace for a hefty month of supply - a potentially powerful headwind for regional bond markets.  \u201cWhile the cut in ECB asset purchases is not a surprise, there is some uncertainty as to how the markets will adjust to this in an unusually heavy month for supply,\u201d said Rainer Guntermann, a rates strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.  \u201cThe more hawkish commentary from the ECB is also weighing on markets.\u201d  Germany\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond yields rose 2.5 basis points to 0.46 percent, the highest level since late October.  German 30-year bond yields jumped almost 5 bps to 1.30 percent, their highest level since mid-November.  In Italy, where borrowing costs rose last week after the country\u2019s president called a general election for March 4, 10-year bond yields extended their rise to a two-month high just above 2 percent.  Most other bond yields in the single currency bloc were around 1-2 basis points higher on the day, with trade generally subdued a day after a public holiday across the world to celebrate the new year.

          "body": "SHANGHAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Hong Kong-listed Chinese firms propelled the Hang Seng Index past the 30,000-point mark to a decade-high on the first trading day of the year, boosted by optimism H-share convertibility reform will fuel more momentum after a bumper 2017.  The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index, which tracks Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies, surged 3 percent after China unveiled on Friday a pilot scheme that would allow mainland-incorporated companies listed in Hong Kong to convert their non-tradable equity into free-floating H-shares.  Although the scheme would potentially increase share supply, investors largely interpreted the reform as positive as it would improve corporate governance and boost foreign interest in Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies.  Some even drew parallels to China\u2019s A-share ownership reform in 2005-2007, which was a prelude to the biggest bull market in China\u2019s modern history.  Currently, shares held by founders or major shareholders of Hong Kong-listed mainland firms are not eligible for trading on exchanges, \u201cwhich is why major shareholders don\u2019t really care about valuation of their H-shares,\u201d said Zhou Liang, fund manager at Minority Asset Management Co, which invests in both China and Hong Kong stocks.  \u201cBut if their shares become tradable, they will pay attention to market valuations and have an incentive to improve operation efficiency.\u201d  Beijing Gaohua Securities Co, the Chinese partner of Goldman Sachs, estimates there are 2.6 trillion yuan ($400.3 billion) worth of non-tradable shares in 249 H-share companies, equivalent to 8 percent of Hong Kong\u2019s stock market.  The brokerage hailed the H-share convertibility scheme as \u201ca milestone in China\u2019s capital market reform,\u201d comparing it with A-share ownership reform, which boosted market capitalisation of A-share companies after converting non-tradable state-owned shares into free-floating stocks during the 2005-07 period.  China will initially select up to three companies in the H-share convertibility pilot scheme.  Albert Xu, a Hong Kong-based analyst at brokerage Zhongtai International, said the reform would eventually lure more Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong, while also making H-shares more attractive to foreign investors.  \u201cIf there\u2019s more availability of shares to foreigners, who can exercise more control through increasing ownership, that would benefit share prices.\u201d  He pointed out that Chinese brokerages with operations in Hong Kong would benefit from the scheme, which would boost trading volume in H-shares, and generate more underwriting fees through an expected increase in Hong Kong listings.  On Tuesday, shares of Hong Kong-listed Chinese brokerages, including China Merchants Securities, Shenwan Hongyuan Securities and Haitong Securities posted solid gains.  China Unicom, reported to be among the first companies to join the pilot scheme, jumped more than 3 percent.  $1 = 6.4947 Chinese yuan\nReporting by Samuel Shen and Brenda Goh; Editing by Jacqueline\nWong"

          "title": "Shunned and homeless LGBT Ukrainians find shelter in Kiev",
          "body": "KIEV (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Staring at the Berlin Wall mural of Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev kissing East German leader Erich Honecker on the mouth,  Yevhenii Kalashnyk knew it was time to come out as gay.  The 20-year-old Ukrainian kissed a friend in front of the graffiti painting in September and posted the photo on Instagram. The decision changed his life.       \u201cI was emotionally full,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview.  He said he had only kissed another man for the first time a few months earlier and had arrived in the German capital about 60-days into his first trip to western Europe where he hoped to find some peace of mind after a difficult period.  For while gay sex has been legal in Ukraine since 1991, it remains socially taboo with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people facing stigma, discrimination and sometimes violent attacks, rights groups say.  Ukrainian authorities have increased their support for gay rights since a pro-Western government took power following the Maidan protests in 2014 and in 2015 passed a law banning workplace discrimination against the LGBT community.  But critics say homophobic attitudes remain widespread. The country scored 19 out of 100 points in a 2016 survey by EU-funded Rainbow Europe ranking LGBT people\u2019s rights in Europe.   Shortly after posting the kiss photo, Kalashnyk received a call from his mother.   \u201cShe asked: \u2018Are you gay?\u2019. I said \u2018yes\u2019 ... Then she started saying very bad things,\u201d he said, adding that his father also threatened him.  Too afraid to go home to Nikopol, Kalashnyk headed to Kiev when he returned to Ukraine about a month later where he found accommodation with Insight, a local gay rights group.  The organization runs Ukraine\u2019s first and only LGBT shelter - a four-room flat, with bunk beds, a kitchen and communal area, in an old apartment block outside Kiev\u2019s city center.  Up to eight guests at a time can receive food, clothing, medicines, a travel card, as well as legal and psychological help, and can stay up to three months, extendable on an ad hoc basis, Insight says.  \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for people to adapt and start a new life. You don\u2019t have to worry about finding work without knowing where to sleep,\u201d said Pavel, a 48-year-old resident from Donetsk, who declined to give his real name.   The facility was launched in June 2014 to help LGBT people fleeing the conflict in the country\u2019s east but has since opened its doors to those from other regions.   More than 10,000 people have been killed and 1.6 million forced from their homes since pro-Russian separatists in the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk rebelled against Kiev\u2019s pro-western government in 2014.  Members of the LGBT community were also affected by the violence with many losing their jobs, having their houses damaged or suffered homophobic attacks amid the upheaval, said Olga Olshanskaya, the Insight shelter coordinator.  She said transgender people were particularly vulnerable to abuse as they had to show ID documents that did not reflect their appearance or sex at checkpoints in conflict-hit areas.  \u201cNo one wants to leave their home, but (for many) coming to Kiev was the only hope,\u201d said Olshanskaya in a room adorned by rainbow flags at Insight\u2019s headquarters in central Kiev.   Oksana, a 35-year-old transgender woman from Donetsk, said a militiaman manning a checkpoint pointed a gun at her head because of her looks weeks before she left for Kiev in 2014.   She had started undergoing hormone treatment two years earlier after another weapon - a hunting rifle she held against her head - misfired in a failed suicide attempt. Until then she had kept her sexuality quiet, fearing the wrath of her family.  \u201cI was born with all the right organs, two legs, two feet but ... not in the right body,\u201d she said. \u201cTo live life as some else is very difficult\u201d.  Oksana, who preferred not to use her full name, spent just over a month at the Insight shelter in Kiev, long enough to find work at a law firm, and has since founded an advocacy group for transgender rights called T-ema.   But life in Kiev can also be difficult.    Kalashnyk said he sometimes suffers verbal abuse and always carries pepper spray to fight off potential assailants.  In 2015 several dozen protesters attacked a gay pride march, throwing flares and clashing with police.   In June this year, the same event went ahead largely without incident under heavy security following threats from ultra-nationalist groups supporting what they say are traditional Ukrainian values.     Pavel, who works in the pharmaceutical sector, decided against attending the rally in case colleagues recognized him.  \u201cIt could have been the end of my career,\u201d he said.  Some supporters of LGBT rights see progress in Ukraine as symptomatic of the country\u2019s closer integration with the European Union and rejecting its ties with neighboring Russia.  But change is happening too slowly for Kalashnyk.  \u201cI don\u2019t see how I can realize myself here. I don\u2019t see my future in Ukraine,\u201d he said.

          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - There is plenty of discord and uncertainty as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second year starts. Yet money is cheap, the global economy is motoring, and markets are ebullient. That combustible mixture could be called \u201cfroth and frustration.\u201d How this ironic social contrast, worthy of Jane Austen, resolves itself will be key for 2018.  Ten years after Lehman Brothers imploded, the bulls are ascendant. A single Hong Kong skyscraper recently fetched $5.2 billion and an imperfect Leonardo da Vinci sold for $450 million. With huge run-ups at tech giants such as Apple and Tencent, global stocks added roughly $13 trillion in value from in the first 11 months of 2017. Bitcoin prices shot for the heavens. Yield-chasers gorged on debut bonds from Tajikistan and the Maldives, and 100-year debt from serial defaulter Argentina.  This is not all hot air. A world recovery is gathering steam: the World Bank reckons global growth will hit 2.9 percent in 2018. The last time expansion was faster, China was splurging on bridges, roads and airports, effectively underwriting a  rebound from the financial crisis. Meanwhile, central banks have barely begun to lift interest rates or sell assets. And online behemoths such as Alibaba and Alphabet keep growing and churning out fat profits.   Investors appear to be taking the same mercenary view as one of Austen\u2019s characters: \u201cA large income is the best recipe for happiness.\u201d Yet things look less reassuring close up.   The populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fuelled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech\u2019s overweening power.  That is the backdrop for Predictions 2018. We have collected more than 40 in a single volume at bit.ly/BVPredicts, with dozens more available at www.breakingviews.com/2018. It is a truth universally acknowledged \u2013 to draw from Austen again \u2013 that forecasting is hard work. But it\u2019s nonetheless a useful exercise, at the very least giving readers a way to frame the big debates ahead intellectually, and perhaps profitably.  This year, we are positive on global growth \u2013 provided Trump and Xi don\u2019t somehow spoil the party. Midterm U.S. elections could have serious investment implications, with radical candidates edging out compromisers, as could a populist resurgence in Latin America.   The bull market need not end badly, although bitcoin could prove a total wipeout \u2013 and several other possible triggers for trouble, like blow-ups in exchange-traded funds or hedge funds, bear watching. Perhaps the biggest financial shift will be at central banks. Markets must adjust to increasingly tight policy at the U.S. Federal Reserve under new Chair Jerome Powell. And for the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends. Much like the modern additions to the Austen canon in \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies,\u201d bond vigilantes will rise from the dead.  The executive suite will see sustained pressure from many sides. Big miners will have to ape buyout shops. One of Wall Street\u2019s titans will bow out. Passive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive. Activists could make an ugly scene in luxury. In India, the long reign of \u201cpromoter\u201d tycoons is, mercifully, nearing its twilight. And corporate America will need to rethink attitudes to diversity and sexual harassment in the wake of recent revelations. But that should catalyse positive change, just as a spate of quality-control crises ought to force Japanese bosses to become more competitive.   In tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life. Europe\u2019s electric cars will catch up with gas guzzlers in cost terms. And super-fast 5G mobile broadband, on show at the Winter Olympics and the World Cup, will demonstrate China\u2019s hunger for technological leadership.   Among tech\u2019s giants, Apple\u2019s position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley\u2019s power and lack of accountability. Amazon could win friends by choosing a deserving location for its second headquarters. The sun will begin to set on U.S. tech\u2019s feudal approach to corporate governance. But Chinese startups could push Hong Kong the other way, while it also bends over backwards to accommodate Saudi Aramco.  Not all of these prognostications will materialise. Last year, among other things, we anticipated India\u2019s banking bailout, argued Beijing would offer Trump more carrot than stick, and correctly highlighted the difficulties Uber and Aramco faced in going public. Our biggest mistake was overestimating the pace of change in Trump\u2019s America, which meant we braced for a stronger dollar, a flood of repatriated cash and an infrastructure bonanza.  With those caveats, we hope this will be an enjoyable and thought-provoking read. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

          "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore\u2019s economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter as factories lost steam, but a services sector recovery has bolstered expectations the central bank could tighten monetary policy as early as April, sending the local currency higher.  The economy expanded 3.1 percent in the October-December quarter from a year earlier, advance estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed on Tuesday, slowing from the third quarter\u2019s upwardly revised 5.4 percent growth, which was the fastest on-year growth in nearly four years.  On an annualized and seasonally-adjusted basis, gross domestic product expanded 2.8 percent, well-down from revised growth of 9.4 percent in the third quarter.  While the quarter-on-quarter growth figure was slightly below the median expectation in a Reuters poll of economists, growth seen in the services sector has fanned market expectations the Monetary Authority of Singapore could tighten policy in 2018.  \u201cThe details looked a bit better, such as the upward revisions to Q3,\u201d said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy for Mizuho Bank in Singapore.  \u201cThere is a sense of a little bit of a broadening recovery and I think markets... are growing more confident of April rather than October MAS move,\u201d Varathan said.  The firmer views on central bank policy helped send the Singapore dollar SGD=D3 up 0.5 percent to S$1.3307 per U.S. dollar at one point, its strongest level in 2-1/2 years. The local currency, on track for its biggest one-day gain since Nov. 22, was also supported by a broadly weaker greenback.  For the whole of 2017, the city-state\u2019s trade-reliant economy grew 3.5 percent, at the top end of the government\u2019s official 3.0 to 3.5 percent forecast range. This was the fastest pace in three years and helped by improved global demand, particularly for electronics products and components such as semiconductors.   The government has previously said it expects growth of 1.5 to 3.5 percent in 2018.  At its last semi-annual policy meeting in October, the central bank held monetary policy steady but changed a reference to maintaining current settings for an extended period, a shift that analysts said created room for a tightening this year.  The latest growth data has done little to dissuade such expectations for monetary tightening.  \u201cWe still hold the view that the MAS is likely to tighten this year, but maybe October rather than April,\u201d said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy for OCBC Bank.  The MAS manages monetary policy through exchange rate settings, rather than interest rates, letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within in an undisclosed policy band.  One focus is on whether the government will announce an increase to the 7-percent goods and services tax (GST) rate when it unveils its 2018 budget in February, Ling said, adding that the MAS may want to take some time to see how the market digests the budget and how inflation data pans out.        The pick-up in economic growth has helped bolster activity  in the city-state\u2019s property market, with private housing prices rising 1 percent in 2017 for the first annual gain since 2013, according to separate data released on Tuesday.      The services sector grew 7.5 percent on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter, its fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2016.  The ministry said growth in this segment was driven by expansion in the financial, wholesale and retail sectors.  Weighing on growth, however, was the manufacturing sector, which lost some shine, contracting 11.5 percent on an annualized basis after jumping 38.0 percent in the third quarter.  Singapore\u2019s strong full-year figures have been helped in large part by strong global demand for electronics products and components produced on the island, a trend that helped other Asian economies in late 2017.

          "body": "BENGALURU (Reuters) - India\u2019s factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in five years in December, a private sector survey showed on Tuesday, buoyed by a rise in output and new orders, which allowed firms to raise prices.  Tuesday\u2019s data firms up views that business in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy continues to recover but also highlights risks that rising price pressures will keep the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from slashing interest rates further.  The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index INPMI=ECI, compiled by IHS Markit, rose to 54.7 in December from November\u2019s 52.6, marking its fifth straight month above the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction.  \u201cIndia\u2019s goods-producing economy advanced on its recovery path, with operating conditions improving at the strongest pace since December 2012,\u201d said Aashna Dodhia, an economist at IHS Markit.  \u201cStrong business performance was underpinned by the fastest expansions in output and new orders since December 2012 and October 2016, respectively. Anecdotal evidence pointed to stronger market demand from home and international markets.\u201d  The country\u2019s manufacturing sector witnessed higher payroll figures in December while the rate of job creation rose to its highest since August 2012.  The latest survey showed the new orders sub-index, a proxy for domestic demand, also rose to 56.8 in December, the highest since October 2016.   Foreign demand also expanded at its quickest pace since June.  \u201cChallenges remain as the economy adjusts to recent shocks, but the overall upturn was robust compared to the trend observed for the survey history. This outlook was shared by the manufacturing community as sentiment picked-up to the strongest in three months amid expected improvements in market conditions over the next 12 months,\u201d Dodhia added.  At the same time, stronger demand allowed firms to raise prices at the fastest pace in 10 months to make up for rising input costs, suggesting overall inflation could remain above the central bank\u2019s medium-term target of 4.0 percent in the coming month.  India\u2019s retail inflation in November breached the central bank\u2019s medium-term target of 4 percent, which could put pressure on it to raise policy rates in the coming months.  Minutes from the RBI\u2019s December meeting show bank members are becoming increasingly concerned about inflation.  Reporting by Vivek Mishra; Editing by Sam Holmes"

          "body": "SHANGHAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The founder of debt-laden tech conglomerate LeEco has defied orders from Chinese regulators to return to the country before end-2017, saying he needed to stay in the United States as a fundraising for his electric car startup was making progress.  The Beijing branch of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued a notice last week ordering LeEco CEO Jia Yueting to return to China to sort out a mounting debt pile linked to his firms and protect investors\u2019 rights.  Jia said in a statement that he had asked his brother, Jia Yuemin, to meet the regulator face-to-face last Friday to provide a report after the notice was issued.  \u201cI am deeply sorry and blame myself for the negative impact of LeEco\u2019s debt crisis,\u201d he said in the statement that was posted on his official WeChat account on Tuesday.  \u201cThe fundraising for Faraday Future in the United States is making significant progress and there are many tasks I need to push forward in order to ensure the production and timely delivery of the FF91,\u201d he said, referring to a luxury electric vehicle (EV) that LeEco is developing with Faraday Future.  Questions have been raised about the outlook for the FF91, given LeEco\u2019s spiralling cash problems as well as its decision to pull out of a joint project with British sports carmaker Aston Martin to develop RapidE electric car.  LeEco, an entertainment, electronics and electric vehicles group, has struggled to pay its debts after rapid expansion into multiple sectors sparked a cash crunch, a plunge in the shares of a listed unit and led to multiple defaults. At its peak LeEco owed creditors 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion).  Struggling to support goals that included beating Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Motors in premium EV making, Jia has been trying to ride out the cash crunch by taking measures such cutting staff numbers and selling assets.  Jia said he had asked his wife, Gan Wei, and brother to represent him at Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp in exercising shareholder rights and handling the sale of assets. Jia stepped down as CEO of the group\u2019s main listed unit in May last year.  He also cited a single late payment in July as being one of the key causes of LeEco\u2019s cash-flow problems, saying it led to the freezing of his assets and prompted a slew of early loan recoveries. He said \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d reports had impacted the business.  Jia was placed on an official blacklist of debt defaulters in early December, a move taken by Chinese courts to put pressure on people and entities to repay debts.

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors on Tuesday flagged 4 percent sales growth in 2018, suggesting a slow recovery from a slump linked to their lack of SUVs in the United States and diplomatic tensions with China.  Hyundai and smaller affiliate Kia said demand was expected to soften in the U.S. and Chinese markets as they unveiled a combined sales target of 7.55 million vehicles this year, from 7.25 million vehicles last year.   \u201cThe market environment is expected to be difficult due to a slowdown in major markets like the U.S. and China, prolonged low growth in the global economy and trade protectionism in major countries,\u201d Hyundai Motor said in a statement.  Sales slumped 7 percent last year from 2016, falling well short of the firms\u2019 target of 8.25 million vehicles and marking their third consecutive annual miss, as buyers in China and the United States increasingly shunned sedans for SUVs.  A diplomatic row between China and South Korea over Seoul\u2019s deployment of a U.S. missile defense system also hit the carmakers\u2019 sales in the world\u2019s biggest auto market, although two countries recently agreed to normalize ties.  \u201cThis year\u2019s target for Hyundai and Kia is lower than expected. It seems to be a conservative target, reflecting a slow recovery in China and ongoing U.S difficulties,\u201d Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities said.    Hyundai Motor shares ended down 4.2 percent on Tuesday, and Kia Motors stocks finished 2.1 percent lower. The broader market rose 0.5 percent.      The grim outlook came as the Korean won strengthened to a more than three-year high against the dollar on Tuesday, threatening the competitiveness of South Korean exporters as their Japanese rivals benefit from the weakening yen.  The expiration of a tax cut on small-engine cars in China also would be a negative for Hyundai\u2019s sedan-heavy line-up, they said.  While Hyundai Motor has plans to offer more SUVs in the United States and China this year, analysts said new models such as the redesigned Santa Fe SUV may come too late in the year to significantly impact sales.  Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong-koo said in a statement it would \u201cactively venture into\u201d new markets like Southeast Asia, as protectionism was expected to grow elsewhere.  South Korea and the United States will hold talks on a trade deal on Jan. 5 although U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the pact.  Chung, 79, skipped his annual New Year speech to employees for a second year in a row. He has not made any public appearances since December, 2016.

          "body": "* Kim wears light grey Western-style suit to make New Year speech  * Departure from previous years when he wore dark Maoist suit  * Gone are old habit of swaying side to side, wavering voice  * Change of image seen reflecting confidence, peace gesture  By Christine Kim  SEOUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The light-grey suit and matching tie North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un donned for his New Year\u2019s address was likely carefully calculated to project a softer, more relaxed image to go with his surprise offer for talks with Seoul, analysts said on Tuesday.  Departing from his usual black or navy suits, Kim gave his televised speech wearing black-rimmed glasses and slicked back hair, speaking fluently and rarely looking down to read as he raised the possibility of sending a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea.  \u201cIn this New Year\u2019s address, North Korea seems to have taken great pains with the image portrayed by Kim Jong Un,\u201d said an analysis by the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification after Kim\u2019s speech.  \u201cThe change from the (Kim\u2019s) previous dark Maoist suits to a softer toned grey Western-style suit likely aimed to underpin peace which Kim stressed in his address, and reflected a relaxed state of mind that probably came with the completion of the North\u2019s nuclear power,\u201d the Institute said.  After a year dominated by fiery rhetoric and escalating tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, the North Korean leader declared his country \u201ca peace-loving and responsible nuclear power\u201d and call for lower military tensions and improved ties with the South.  Kim also said he was open to dialogue with Seoul, prompting South Korea on Tuesday to propose high-level talks between the two countries on Jan. 9 at the border truce village of Panmunjeom.  Analysts said the North Korean leader\u2019s speech on Monday showed more confidence compared to previous years, his old habit of swaying from side to side while making speeches nearly undetectable. In his first New Year\u2019s address as North Korea\u2019s leader in 2013, Kim had frequently sounded short of breath, his voice wavering from time to time.  This year, there was none of that.  Kim Gun-hee, a consultant on image making and leadership, said the grey suit may have been designed to deflect some of the negative global attention Kim\u2019s nuclear and missile tests have prompted.  \u201cWhen we advise clients who are in tough situations or are surrounded by unfavourable rumours, we tell them to wear either white or grey,\u201d she said.  \u201cIn the study of color psychology, white imbues innocence while grey tends to take attention away from you. Kim may have felt some pressure from being at the centre of global focus and turned to grey after sticking to dark tones for several years.\u201d (Reporting by Christine Kim; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Lincoln Feast)"

          "body": "* North Korea calls for reduced tensions with South  * South says inter-Korean relations tied to nuclear dispute  * Weapons tests likely to continue despite overtures  By Josh Smith and David Brunnstrom  SEOUL/WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - After a year of threats and weapons advances, North Korea\u2019s leader appears to be using the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in South Korea as a tool to blunt growing international pressure on his regime while leaving his nuclear arsenal untouched.  Kim Jong Un, in his annual New Year\u2019s Day speech, called for reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and flagged the North\u2019s possible participation in the Games next month, just across the border in Pyeongchang.  South Korea has been eager to involve North Korea to ensure the Games are not disrupted by any further nuclear or missile tests and as a way of re-establishing dialogue with the reclusive state.  Analysts say Kim\u2019s gambit is aimed at driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington, which has advocated a strategy of maximum pressure and insisted that all options, including military ones, are on the table.  But the move also targets the broader international consensus involving major players China, Russia and Japan that has tightened sanctions and deepened isolation for North Korea in recent months.  \u201cA major part of the Kim family playbook is to exploit and to widen the divergences in the interests, in the first instance between the U.S. and South Korea, but more broadly among the five major neighbours,\u201d said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until last April and now at the Asia Society Policy Institute.  North Korea has long followed such a strategy of intense provocations followed by conciliatory phases aimed at exposing rifts, he said.  \u201cThis is a classic united we stand, divided we fall situation,\u201d Russel said. \u201cIt\u2019s always easier to maintain five party solidarity when North Korea is behaving badly.\u201d  U.S. President Donald Trump has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea as it seeks to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.  Washington says the full cooperation of China, Russia and other countries is vital to the success of this effort, which includes significant restrictions on trade and other ties with North Korea.  China, which remains North Korea\u2019s major partner, has curtailed trade in line with United Nations sanctions, but Washington has called for it to do more to isolate Pyongyang.  South Korea\u2019s government publicly welcomed Kim\u2019s overture, and President Moon Jae-in has pushed to ease tensions ahead of the Games by postponing joint military drills with American troops until after the Olympics.  Moon also said on Tuesday the improvement of inter-Korean ties was linked to resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme.  The White House has yet to make a detailed response. However, powerful Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the United States would boycott the Games if North Korea attends.  \u201cAllowing Kim Jong Un\u2019s North Korea to participate in Winter Olympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet,\u201d Graham said on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m confident South Korea will reject this absurd overture and fully believe that if North Korea goes to the Winter Olympics, we do not.\u201d  Graham unsuccessfully called for a boycott of the previous Winter Olympics in Sochi over Russia\u2019s granting of asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden.  The spectacle of North Korean athletes and officials participating in Olympic events may create some awkward moments for international leaders who have spent months painting the country as a pariah state, said Robert Kelly, a professor at South Korea\u2019s Pusan National University.  \u201cIt puts the South Koreans in a weird position because it potentially creates tension between U.S. and Japan who have gone to lengths to isolate the regime,\u201d he said.  Japan\u2019s relationship with South Korea is already seen as under some strain, with one former Japanese diplomat saying Tokyo was suffering from \u201cfatigue\u201d with Seoul and lacking confidence in Moon.  Still, analysts were sceptical Kim\u2019s gambit would do lasting damage to the alliance between Seoul and Washington, or to the international push for sanctions.  \u201cI doubt that there will be a substantial reversal in global economic and political isolation measures in the near term,\u201d said Scott Snyder, director of U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.  At the heart of analysts\u2019 scepticism is Kim\u2019s apparent lack of appetite for compromise on the main points of nuclear weapons, missile testing, or human rights.  \u201cParticipation in things like the Olympics are pseudo-concessions, because the North doesn\u2019t actually have to give up anything,\u201d Kelly said.  In his speech, Kim vowed he would spend 2018 \u201cmass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles\u201d to \u201cgive a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action.\u201d  That means further missile tests are almost certain, with more focus on \u201crealistic\u201d exercises than developmental tests, said Joshua Pollack, a senior researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.  \u201cThe major theme here for strategic forces is shifting from development to serial production, deployment, and increased readiness,\u201d he said.  If the United States wants to take advantage of any possible easing in tensions, it needs to drop its demands for a halt in testing as a precondition for talks, said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project in New York.  \u201cThe most important reciprocal step would be to scale back - not (just) postpone - the spring joint exercises,\u201d he said. \u201cFailure to try these steps will only ensure that unbridled North Korean weapons development continues.\u201d  Reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington and Josh Smith in Seoul; Additional reporting by Linda Sieg in Tokyo; Editing by Lincoln Feast"

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) SINGAPORE/COLOMBO, January 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Sri Lanka Telecom PLC's (SLT, AAA(lka)/Stable) proposed senior unsecured debenture issue of up to LKR7 billion an expected National Long-Term Rating of 'AAA(lka)(EXP)'. The debentures will have a tenor of 10 years and carry fixed coupons. The debentures will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange, with the proceeds to be used to refinance its short-term debt and fund SLT's capex plans. SLT's senior unsecured debt is rated at the same level as its National Long-Term Rating, as the debentures rank equally with other senior unsecured obligations. The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS Proposed Tax Credit Negative: Fitch believes SLT's 2018 operating EBITDAR margin could decline to 24% (2017 forecast: 29%) and its funds flow from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage could deteriorate to 2.5x (2017 forecast: 1.9x) if it were to pay an additional LKR3 billion tax for its mobile towers. The proposed monthly tax of LKR200,000 per mobile tower was announced on 9 November 2017 in Sri Lanka's 2018 budget. SLT's fully owned subsidiary, Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd., owns over 1,500 towers. We expect SLT's ratings to remain unaffected, as it has sufficient headroom to absorb the proposed tax. However, Fitch has not factored in the impact of the tower tax in its base case, as the budget proposal has not been finalised. Negative FCF; Large Capex: We expect SLT to have a free cash flow (FCF) deficit during 2017-2020 (2017 forecast: LKR7 billion deficit), as cash flow from operation could fall short in funding large capex plans to expand the group's optical fibre infrastructure and 3G/4G mobile networks. We expect SLT's 2017 capex to reach about LKR25 billion, or 34% of revenue, before moderating to LKR20 billion-23 billion per year. SLT's fibre investments are likely to have low returns due to the country's low broadband tariffs. Dividends are likely to remain similar to historical levels of LKR1.6 billion. Data Drives Growth: SLT's data revenue growth will improve following the removal of the telco levy on data services from September 2017, which will lower the effective tax rate to around 20% from 32%. However, we forecast SLT's EBITDA margin to dilute by about 50bp a year over 2018-2020, as improving profitability on fixed-broadband and mobile internet usage will only partly offset margin dilution from a falling share of profitable fixed-voice and international operations. Overall revenue growth is likely to slow to 1.5% in 2017 (9M17: 1.3%, 2016: 8.5%) due to the reintroduction of value added tax and nation building tax on telecom services, but should recover to the mid-single digits in 2018-2019 along with better mobile-voice revenue and the robust data growth. Solid Market Position: SLT's ratings are underpinned by its market-leading position in fixed-line services and second-largest position in mobile, along with its ownership of an extensive optical fibre network. The company's stable cash generation benefits from its diversified service offerings, including fixed-voice, broadband, mobile, pay-TV, enterprise and international operations. We believe SLT's market position will strengthen, as it plans to expand its mobile and fibre infrastructure. Market Consolidation, M&A Risk: We expect some industry consolidation due to ongoing intense competition, especially in the mobile segment; this segment has five operators that face still-high investment requirements and the smaller operators are unprofitable. SLT's National Long-Term Rating could come under pressure if it were to perform a debt-funded acquisition of a smaller operator; any rating action will be based on the acquisition price, funding structure and the financial and operating profile of the combined entity. DERIVATION SUMMARY SLT's National Long-Term Rating is based on a comparison of domestic peers. SLT has lower exposure to the crowded mobile market and more diverse service platforms than Sri Lanka's mobile market leader, Dialog Axiata PLC (AAA(lka)/Stable). Sri Lanka's hard-liquor market leader, Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka PLC (DIST, AAA(lka)/Rating Watch Negative), has a smaller operating scale compared with SLT because a significant portion of the country's alcoholic beverage consumption occurs outside the formal sector in which DIST operates. DIST is also exposed to more regulatory risk in the form of recurrent increases in indirect taxation. These risks are counterbalanced by DIST's substantially stronger free cash flow. SLT's forecast 2017 FFO adjusted net leverage of 1.9x is slightly higher than that of DIST and Dialog. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: - Proposed mobile tower taxes are not implemented. - Slower revenue growth of 1.5% in 2017 (2016: 8.5%) due to higher taxes. Growth to recover from 2018 to mid-single-digit percentage, driven by fixed-broadband and mobile data services. - Operating EBITDAR margin to dilute by about 50bp in 2017-2018 due to a change in revenue mix. - Capex/revenue to peak at 34% in 2017 (9M17: 36%), before moderating to around 28%-30% as SLT expands its fibre and 3G/4G networks. - Dividend payout to remain similar to 2016 levels of LKR1.6 billion. - FCF deficit during 2017-2020 resulting in gradual increase in FFO adjusted net leverage. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: -  There is no scope for an upgrade as SLT is at the highest rating on the Sri Lankan national ratings scale. Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - A debt-funded acquisition of a smaller operator could threaten SLT's National Long-Term Rating, depending on the acquisition price and the financial profile of the combined entity. LIQUIDITY Strong Access to Banks: SLT's liquidity was inadequate as at end-September 2017, with cash of LKR6 billion and committed undrawn bank lines of LKR10 billion being insufficient to fund short-term debt of LKR26 billion and the annual FCF deficit of around LKR7 billion. However, we expect SLT to comfortably refinance its short-term debt, as the company has a demonstrated record of accessing capital from local banks and capital markets.

British Airways\u2019 owner IAG said on Friday it would buy Niki, Air Berlin\u2019s insolvent Austrian holiday airline, for 20 million euros ($24 million) and provide additional liquidity to the company of up to 16.5 million euros.  Separately, Brussels Airlines, a unit of Lufthansa, plans to cut its costs by between 10 and 15 percent in the coming years in order to remain competitive with low-cost rivals, its chief executive told Belgian daily De Tijd in an interview published on Saturday.  The German chipmaker does not see itself as vulnerable to a takeover despite mega-mergers in the sector led by Broadcom\u2019s $103 billion offer for Qualcomm, its chief executive told Germany\u2019s Boersen-Zeitung.  Siemens will test the appetite of sovereign wealth funds ahead of the planned listing of its healthcare unit Healthineers next year, its chief executive told a German weekly, possibly to secure anchor investors for the flotation.  Germany\u2019s highest court has rejected a bid by Volkswagen AG to suspend the work of a special auditor appointed to investigate management\u2019s actions in the \u201cDieselgate\u201d emissions scandal.  Separately, Swiss consumer protection organisation SKS filed a claim with the Zurich commercial court on behalf of some 6,000 car owners seeking damages from Volkswagen and Swiss car dealer AMAG related to the \u201cDieselgate\u201d emissions scandal.  LEG Immobilien expects residential rent to go up by an average 3 to 3.5 percent annually over the next few years, its chief executive told Welt am Sonntag.

          "body": "* Dollar index languishes near 3-month lows  * Euro steady, trades above $1.20 threshold  * Asian currencies edge higher vs dollar  * Chinese yuan hits highest since early September  By Masayuki Kitano  SINGAPORE, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The dollar languished near a three-month low versus a basket of major currencies on Tuesday as markets reopened at the start of 2018, while Asian currencies such as the Chinese yuan began the year on a high note.  The dollar\u2019s index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 92.162. On Friday it had slipped to as low as 92.080, the weakest level since Sept. 22.  For the whole of 2017, the dollar index slid more than 9.8 percent, the greenback\u2019s worst annual performance since 2003.  The dollar retreated in 2017, partly because economic growth picked up outside the United States, with other countries\u2019 central banks moving towards tighter monetary policy, lessening the perceived divergence between the Federal Reserve and others.  The euro edged up 0.1 percent on the day at $1.2018, after having surged 14 percent in 2017 for its best annual performance since 2003.  The euro had risen 1.1 percent in the last week of 2017, bringing it back within sight of a 2-1/2 year peak of $1.2092 set in September.  In addition to political factors such as the Italian election in March, a key factor for the euro in 2018 is how the European Central Bank proceeds with curtailing its massive monetary stimulus.  With the dollar on the defensive, emerging Asian currencies clawed higher. The Chinese yuan rose to as high as 6.4922 yuan per dollar, its highest level since Sept. 8.  \u201cHighlighting today\u2019s moves is the euro trading above $1.20 and the Chinese yuan dropping below 6.5,\u201d said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.  \u201cThere\u2019s across-the-board strength in Asian currencies on the back of such moves,\u201d Okagawa said, adding that a drop in the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield toward the end of 2017 was helping to weigh on the U.S. dollar.  The greenback\u2019s weak tone helped boost the Singapore dollar , which rose to S$1.3322 per U.S. dollar at one point, its strongest level since June 2016.  In addition, data released on Tuesday showed Singapore\u2019s economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter as factories lost steam, but a services sector recovery helped underscore expectations that the city-state\u2019s central bank could tighten its exchange-rate based monetary policy as early as April.  Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known digital currency, fell 2.0 percent to around $13,175 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.  Bitcoin had soared in 2017, gaining more than 1,300 percent for the year. (Reporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)"

          "body": "Jalen Hurts threw two touchdown passes to complement a stifling defense as Alabama defeated Clemson, 24-6, in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Allstate Sugar Bowl on Monday night in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.  The No. 4 Crimson Tide (12-1) will face No. 3 Georgia, which beat No. 2 Oklahoma, 54-48, in the Rose Bowl, in an all-SEC CFP Championship on Jan. 8 in Atlanta. The defending CFP champion Tigers finished 13-2.  Hurts, who ran 11 times for 40 yards, completed 16-of-24 for 120 yards and tossed a 12-yard touchdown to Calvin Ridley and a 1-yarder to defensive tackle Da\u2019Ron Payne.  Alabama led by seven at halftime, but committed the game\u2019s first turnover on the first play of the third quarter when Hurts fumbled and Kendall Joseph recovered for Clemson at the Alabama 20. The Tigers lost five yards in three plays and Alex Spence kicked a 42-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 10-6.  Clemson was approaching field-goal range again on its next possession when Kelly Bryant was hit while releasing the ball and it fell to Payne for an interception. His 21-yard return and a penalty on the Tigers for a horse-collar tackle put the Tide at the Clemson 27.  Seven plays later, Payne entered the game apparently as a blocker but the 308-pound defensive tackle instead caught a Hurts pass.  On the first play of the ensuing possession, another Bryant pass was tipped and Mack Wilson grabbed the ball and ran 18 yards for a touchdown that gave the Tide a 24-6 lead.  Alabama coach Nick Saban has the Crimson Tide in the national championship game for the sixth time.  Bryant completed 18-of-36 for 124 yards and the Tigers had just 188 total yards.  Alabama had a big edge in early field position and took advantage. It drove 47 yards to Andy Pappanastos\u2019 24-yard field goal and 46 yards to Hurts\u2019 touchdown pass to Ridley for a 10-0 lead after one quarter.  Clemson didn\u2019t have a first down in the first quarter, but put together a 13-play, 54-yard drive to Spence\u2019s 44-yard field early in the second quarter.  Pappanostos\u2019 38-yard field-goal attempt with 12 seconds left in the second quarter, bounced off the left upright and landed in the end zone, leaving the Crimson Tide with its 10-3 halftime lead."

          "body": "* Asia shares ex-Japan cheered by upbeat China survey  * Dollar downtrodden after suffering worst year since 2003  * Commodities benefit from dollar weakness, China demand  * Oil prices recoup early losses to hit highest since mid-2015  By Wayne Cole  SYDNEY, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Asian shares scaled a decade peak on Tuesday after a survey of Chinese manufacturing proved surprisingly upbeat, while the  euro lurked within striking distance of its 2017 top against an ailing U.S. dollar.  Sentiment was also helped by news that North Korea had offered an olive branch to South Korea, with Kim Jong Un saying he was \u201copen to dialogue\u201d with Seoul.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 0.9 percent to heights last visited in 2007, having risen by one-third in value last year alone.  Japan\u2019s Nikkei was closed for a holiday. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent and spread betters predicted a firmer opening on European bourses.  Shanghai blue chips climbed 1.2 percent after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline.  The reading pointed to resilience in the world\u2019s second-largest economy even as Beijing cracks down on industrial pollution and engineers a cooling property market.  \u201cManufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,\u201d said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.  In currency markets, the dollar remained out of favour having hit a three-month low against a basket of its peers on Friday. That brought its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worse performance since 2003.  Its pain was the euro\u2019s gain, with the single currency enjoying its strongest year against the dollar in 14 years. On Tuesday, the euro was firm at $1.2017 and just off a three-month top of $1.2028.  Bulls were now eyeing the September peak of $1.2092, a break of which would take the euro to ground last trod in late 2014.  The euro had already broken major resistance on the yen to reach highs not seen since late 2015 at 135.45, leaving the dollar struggling at 112.70 yen.  A major hurdle for the dollar will be Wednesday\u2019s release of minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting when it raised interest rates. Two policymakers voted against the move amid doubts inflation would accelerate as hoped.  \u201cWith the market pricing in a 68 percent chance of a March hike and two hikes for 2018, there will be close inspection to assess just how shaky their confidence is for any pick-up in inflationary trends,\u201d said Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at broker IG in Sydney.  \u201cThat said, the U.S. dollar is underloved and oversold and it won\u2019t take much to promote a bout of profit-taking from the shorts.\u201d  The skid in the dollar, combined with strength in Chinese demand, has benefited commodities priced into the currency.  Copper dipped back a little on Tuesday to $7,223.50 a tonne, but that follows a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top. Aluminium amassed gains of 34 percent.  Gold was 0.37 percent firmer at $1,307.25 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.  Brent crude oil futures ended the year with a 17 percent rise, while U.S. crude climbed 12 percent on strong demand and declining global inventories.  On Tuesday, Brent put on another 22 cents to $67.09 a barrel, while U.S. crude firmed 15 cents to $60.57.  Editing by Richard Borsuk and Sam Holmes"

          "title": "China's yuan extends rally to near four-month high on dollar weakness",
          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China\u2019s yuan rose to its firmest against the U.S. dollar in nearly four months in thin trade on Tuesday, breaching a key threshold, supported by a stronger fixing and broad dollar weakness.  The dollar slipped to its lowest in more than three months against a basket of major currencies, marking its steepest annual drop since 2003, on doubts over durability of a pick-up in U.S. economic growth in the wake of the country\u2019s tax overhaul.  The Chinese currency registered a rise of around 6.8 percent against the greenback in 2017, the biggest gain in nine years, also recovering from a roughly 6.5 percent loss a year earlier and reversing three straight years of depreciation.  Prior to market opening on Tuesday, the People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate CNY=PBOC at 6.5079 per dollar, 263 pips or 0.4 percent firmer than the previous fix of 6.5342 on Friday.  Tuesday\u2019s fixing was the strongest since Sept. 11, 2017.  The firmer fixing lifted spot yuan higher. The onshore yuan CNY=CFXS opened at 6.5030 per dollar, breaching the psychologically important 6.5 per dollar level and rose to a high of 6.4922 at one point, the firmest since Sept. 8.  As of midday, the onshore spot yuan was changing hands at 6.5012, 57 pips firmer than the previous late session close and 0.10 percent stronger than the midpoint.  Its offshore counterpart CNH=D3 was trading only 1 pip higher than the onshore spot at 6.5011 per dollar at midday.   Traders said the rally in the yuan on the first trading day of the year was catching up with dollar weakness in overseas markets.   Tommy Xie, economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore, said in a note on Tuesday that gains in the yuan in the past two weeks were mainly driven by \u201cthin liquidity and a weaker dollar\u201d.  Trading remained tepid on Tuesday as many market participants were still on holiday. The daily trading volume CNYSPTVOL=CFXT stood at $7.925 billion, compared with around $15 billion typically.  Xie Yaxuan, an analyst at China Merchants Securities, said he expects the yuan to trade in a range of 6.45 to 6.95 per dollar in 2018, due to the central bank\u2019s \u201ccounter-cyclical factor\u201d, domestic foreign exchange supply and demand, and potential gains in the dollar.  The \u201ccounter-cyclical factor\u201d was introduced by the central bank in May 2017, and was designed to reduce price swings and stabilize market expectations.  On a trade-weighted basis .CFSCNYI, the yuan was largely flat from a year earlier against a basket of currencies of China\u2019s trading partners at the end of 2017, according to official data from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS).  The index, published on a weekly basis, stood at 94.85 on Friday, up 0.02 from 94.83 at the end of 2016.  The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index .RXYH, which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, stood at 95.95, firmer than the previous day\u2019s 95.89.   The global dollar index .DXY rose to 92.183 from the previous close of 92.124.   Offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts (NDFs)CNY1YNDFOR=, considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations of the yuan\u2019s value, traded at 6.6325, 1.88 percent weaker than the midpoint.  One-year NDFs are settled against the midpoint, not the spot rate.  Reporting by Winni Zhou and Brenda Goh; Editing by Jacqueline Wong"

That compared to a 2.7 percent increase in October. November\u2019s drop was the first decline in foreign tourist arrivals since December 2015.

          "body": "(Reuters) - World number two Garbine Muguruza\u2019s wretched run of injury retirements at the Brisbane International extended to a fourth consecutive year on Tuesday when the Spaniard succumbed to leg cramps in the third set of her opening match.  The top seed started well in her second round encounter against unseeded Serbian Aleksandra Krunic, converting her seventh set point in a marathon 12th game to claim the opener before roaring to a 5-2 lead in the second.  The reigning Wimbledon champion was coasting but the 53rd-ranked Krunic mounted a stirring fight back and reeled off four of the next five games to force a tiebreak, which she claimed by a 7-3 margin to send the contest into a deciding set.  However, Mugurza broke the Serb in the first game of the third and was serving at 2-1 up before she collapsed on the baseline and retired immediately when she was helped off the court to receive treatment for cramping in both legs.  The early exit cost Muguruza a chance to replace Romania\u2019s Simona Halep at the top of the world rankings ahead of the Australian Open later this month but the Spaniard\u2019s immediate concern will be to get fit for the first grand slam of the year.  Muguruza\u2019s run of injury woes in the tournament dates back to 2015 when she withdrew on the eve of the event with an ankle problem, before a left foot injury ended her 2016 campaign and a right thigh problem led to her semi-final retirement last year.  \u201cI\u2019m not happy with what happened today and I want to wish Garbine a fast recovery. I hope she gets better for the slam,\u201d Krunic, who advanced to the quarter-finals, said in a courtside interview.  Writing by John O'Brien in Singapore; Editing by Greg Stutchbury"
