          "body": "Using balanced scoring and solid defense, the Portland Trail Blazers pulled away from the hapless Atlanta Hawks in the second half Friday night to notch a 110-89 win at Moda Center in Portland, Ore.  CJ McCollum led seven double-figure scorers for Portland (20-18) with 20 points, adding six assists and four rebounds. Damian Lillard and Al-Farouq Aminu each scored 14 points, while forward Ed Davis came off the bench to net 12.  Portland\u2019s Jusuf Nurkic and reserve guard Pat Connaughton each tallied 11 points, and Evan Turner hit for 10.  The Trail Blazers moved the ball well and got good shots most of the night, converting 53.8 percent of their shots and drawing 30 assists on 43 field goals. They were 13 of 30 from 3-point range.  Dennis Schroder scored 14 points but made just 5 of 14 field-goal tries for Atlanta (10-28), while Taurean Price added 11 points and eight rebounds. No one else reached double figures for the Hawks, which maintained the NBA\u2019s worst record.  Coming off a demoralizing loss Tuesday night in which it blew an eight-point lead with 1:37 left as the Phoenix Suns took a 104-103 win, Atlanta sank only 36.1 percent of its field-goal attempts Friday and hit just 8 of 26 3-point tries.  However, the Hawks were in the game for a half, actually pulling within 47-46 at the 2:27 mark of the second quarter on John Collins\u2019 jumper before Portland expanded the lead to 52-46 at intermission.  The third quarter started with a delay-of-game call on Atlanta, followed by a turnover that led to a transition bucket by Lillard. That was a sign of coming attractions as the Trail Blazers pushed the advantage to 74-57 at the 5:12 mark of the period on a foul shot by Nurkic.  Portland led by 14 after three quarters and quickly upped the margin to 93-70 with 9:33 left on a pullup jumper by Connaughton, rendering the game\u2019s remainder a race to the final horn.  The Hawks finished with more turnovers (16) than assists (14).  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Guards John Wall and Bradley Beal took turns torching the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night, combining for 59 points as the Washington Wizards notched a 102-100 win at FedExForum in Memphis, Tenn.  Beal tallied 34 points on just 18 shot attempts, hitting the 30-point mark for the seventh time this year. He also chipped in five assists. Wall needed only 16 shot attempts to score 25 points, and he added nine assists as Washington (23-16) stayed atop the Southeast Division.  Markieff Morris and reserve forward Mike Scott added 12 and 10 points, respectively, for the Wizards, with Morris hauling in 17 rebounds for a double-double. Washington won its fourth consecutive game and sixth in its past seven despite shooting 39.3 percent from the field.  Tyreke Evans scored 26 points and dished out seven assists to pace Memphis (12-27). Center Marc Gasol contributed 17 points, 11 rebounds, five blocks and five assists. Mario Chalmers added 13 points and forward JaMychal Green was good for 11.  Green helped inject some late-game drama into the proceedings by swishing a corner 3-pointer with 1:19 left, capping a 7-0 run that pulled the Grizzlies within 97-94. Memphis actually could have cut the deficit to one, but Chalmers forced a jumper in traffic that missed.  Marcin Gortat sank a foul shot with 30.6 seconds remaining to restore a two-possession lead for the Wizards. Evans drilled a line-drive 3-pointer with 17.9 seconds left that brought the Grizzlies within 98-97.  Beal converted two foul shots with 13.8 ticks on the clock to make it a three-point game. Evans\u2019 potential game-tying 3-point try was long, and Morris ended the suspense by hitting two foul shots with 3.5 seconds remaining.  Memphis led 17-12 just over 6 1/2 minutes into the game when Gasol stroked a trey, but Washington stormed back and opened up a 33-24 advantage after the first quarter. The Wizards expanded the lead to 58-50 at the half and 87-72 following three quarters before the Grizzles nearly stole the game with their late surge.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Dustin Johnson offered a reminder that he is still the world number one as he moved within one stroke of second-round leaders Marc Leishman and Brian Harman at the Sentry Tournament of Champions in Hawaii on Friday.  Johnson recovered from a slow start to run up seven birdies for a five-under-par 68 on the Kapalua Plantation course on the island of Maui.  He was deprived of a share of the lead only when Leishman and Harman both birdied the 663-yard, par-five 18th which plunges down the West Maui mountains.  Leishman (69) and Harman (68) posted 10-under 136. They also thrived in conditions which started with a strong trade wind blowing down the mountain, before abating late in the day.  \u201cI got off to a rough start, bogeyed three and four from the middle of the fairway,\u201d said 2013 champion Johnson, who has never shot over par on the course.  \u201cI was hitting some good shots, just didn\u2019t score very well.   \u201c(Birdies at the sixth, eighth and ninth holes) got me back in the rhythm and played a really solid back nine.\u201d  Johnson has not made many headlines since a fall on tournament eve knocked him out of the Masters last April, a tournament he would have started as hot favorite coming off three consecutive victories.  But he has done enough to stay atop the world rankings for close to an year.  Co-leader Leishman is coming off a two-win season, and the easy-going 34-year-old has his eye on even bigger and better things.  \u201cIt was tough (playing in the wind), really happy with four birdies, no bogeys,\u201d he said.  \u201cYou play to win. Having a year like I had last year, confidence is high. I feel like when I\u2019m in this position I need to finish it off... but a lot of golf to play.\u201d  The diminutive Harman used an unlikely birdie at the par-five 15th to springboard into a share of the lead.  After fluffing his third shot, an uphill pitch that failed to reach the green and rolled back nearly to his feet, he then made amends by pitching in his next shot from 80 feet.

          "body": "Matt Duchene scored seven seconds into overtime, giving the Ottawa Senators a come-from-behind, 6-5 victory over the San Jose Sharks Friday night in Ottawa.  Duchene won the overtime\u2019s opening faceoff, then scored at the end of a two-on-one with Mike Hoffman that completed the Senators\u2019 rally from a pair of three-goal deficits.  The goal ended San Jose goalie Aaron Dell\u2019s shot at a seventh consecutive victory.  Duchene finished with two goals and one assist. Hoffman added one goal and three assists, while Mark Stone had a goal plus two helpers for Ottawa.  Tomas Hertl scored two goals for the Sharks, who led 4-1 and then seemed to be in control with a 5-2 edge heading into the third period.  However, Ottawa got 17 shots and three goals in the third period, forcing overtime and setting up Duchene\u2019s game-winning shot.  The Sharks started quickly with two goals in the first period and three more in the second.  Hertl started the scoring with a short-handed goal on a breakaway 6:29 into the game. After Ryan Dzingel tied the game for the Senators, Melker Karlsson gave the Sharks the lead later in the period.  Karlsson deflected a Joakim Ryan shot past goalie Craig Anderson with 7:04 left in the first period for a 2-1 lead. Chris Tierney and Brent Burns scored just 1:51 apart early in the second period, stretching the San Jose advantage to 4-1.  Stone and Hertl then traded second-period goals, and San Jose held a 5-2 lead after two.  The Senators\u2019 rally began when Derick Brassard scored 26 seconds into the third period. Duchene scored at 8:25 and Hoffman followed by tying the game 5-5 at 10:48.  Burns finished with a goal and an assist while Logan Couture handed out three assists for San Jose. The Sharks (21-12-6) took their second loss in two nights as they fell in a shootout against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday.  The Senators (13-17-9) won for just the fifth times in 23 contests.  Stone now has 12 points in his past 11 games.  Ottawa forward Zack Smith came back after a shoulder injury sidelined him for the past five games.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Dustin Byfuglien and Bryan Little each added a goal for the Jets (24-11-7). Winnipeg improved to 4-0-1 in its past five games.  Buffalo\u2019s Marco Scandella got his first goal of the season, and Johan Larsson and Scott Wilson each posted a goal for the Sabres (10-22-9).  Jason Pominville and Evan Rodrigues both gave the Sabres two assists.  Each team finished with 29 shots, but Winnipeg notched a pair of power-play goals that made the difference.  Byfuglien scored his first goal in his 30th game this season. The power-play effort gave the Jets a 1-0 lead 9:27 into the game. Scandella tied it with his tally at 11:40 of the opening period.  The Jets then scored two straight, one at 15:46 of the first period from Trouba and a second power-play goal, this time from Wheeler at 6:06 of the second period. Wheeler snapped a shot from the right circle past goalie Chad Johnson to give Winnipeg a 3-1 lead.  Larsson answered for Buffalo at 18:03 of the middle period before Bryan Little made it 4-2 just 25 seconds into the third period.  The Sabres, who have dealt with offensive issues in the past several games, cut the deficit to 4-3 on a Wilson goal with 7:43 left in the game. Buffalo pulled the goalie in the final moments, but Winnipeg held on.  Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck made 26 saves for the win. Johnson stopped 25 shots.  Winnipeg moved their impressive home record to 15-3-1. The Jets play host to the San Jose Sharks on Sunday.  The Sabres reached the halfway point in the season with the defeat.

          "body": "BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Street crews dug out snow-clogged roads across the U.S. Northeast on Friday after a powerful blizzard, as temperatures plunged during a brutal cold spell that has already killed at least 18 people.     Extreme cold will reach from New England to the Midwest and down to the Carolinas, forecasters warned. Temperatures were expected to be 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit below average across the northeastern United States for the next several days.  From Baltimore to Caribou, Maine, workers battled to clear snow and ice as wind chills were forecast to fall as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius) in some areas after sundown, according to the National Weather Service.   In the latest fatality blamed on the harsh conditions, a driver slid off an icy road, killing a pedestrian, early on Friday in North Charleston, South Carolina, city officials said. The 17-year-old driver was arrested on charges including going too fast for the conditions, they said.  \u201cTHE DANGERS ARE REAL,\u201d the officials warned in a Twitter message. \u201cHuge patches of ice all over the city. Stay at home.\u201d  In much of New England on Friday, the highs reached only into the single digits or teens Fahrenheit, but wind chills made  it feel below zero in many places.  \u201cIt can be very dangerous,\u201d said Dan Pydynowski, a meteorologist with private forecasting service AccuWeather. \u201cAny kind of exposed skin can freeze in a couple of minutes.\u201d   There were noticeably fewer tourists on Friday afternoon in New York City\u2019s Times Square, which is usually thronged with visitors.  Arjun Shah, a 22-year-old Briton, studies in Indiana but had never visited the U.S. East Coast. He flew in to New York City, where temperatures have been below freezing since Christmas Day, just 24 hours before the blizzard struck.  \u201cOh it\u2019s so bad! It\u2019s not this bad in London,\u201d Shah said, shivering while taking a break from snapping photos of Times Square.  In Washington, bundled-up tourists ventured onto the frozen Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial before being shooed away by a National Park Service ranger.   The memorial, also normally busy with visitors, was mostly vacant with temperatures in the teens and bone-chilling winds that sent American flags whipping straight out from their poles.  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt this cold, ever,\u201d said Zoie Irwin, a 19-year-old student from San Francisco State University as she huddled with friends.  At the nearby National World War II Memorial, Varun Solipuram, a 31-year-old native of Hyderabad, India, who studies in California, said he was taken aback by snow in the bright winter sun.  \u201cIt\u2019s really beautiful,\u201d Solipuram said.   The storm that swept in on Thursday with gusts of more than 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour), dumped 22 inches (56 cms) of snow in parts of Maine and 17 inches (43 cm) in parts of Massachusetts, before ending on Friday, the National Weather Service said.  The storm was powered by a rapid drop in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d  Cities from Houston to Boston have stepped up efforts to bring the homeless to shelters. Authorities said that three homeless people in Texas died from exposure to the cold.     Canada\u2019s largest city, Toronto, scrambled to find emergency shelter for the homeless as temperatures dropped to record lows after the sweeping storm knocked out power to tens of thousands in eastern provinces and destroyed coastal roads.  Numbing temperatures have also had some unusual effects: cold-shocked iguanas fell out of trees in Florida and wildlife officials in the state said they had rescued more than 200 stunned sea turtles from freezing waters.  Schools in New York were open, while children in Boston and Baltimore enjoyed a second day of canceled classes. Schools in Newark, New Jersey, opened two hours later than usual.  Commuters riding railways serving New York and Boston\u2019s suburbs endured extensive delays as crews worked to repair frozen equipment and clear snow-covered tracks.  New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports resumed flights on Friday after closing during whiteout conditions the day before. More than 1,500 flights at U.S. East Coast airports had been canceled by Friday evening, most at the New York area\u2019s three major airports and Boston Logan International Airport.   Nearly 500 members of the National Guard were activated to assist with the emergency response along the East Coast, including 200 in New York state, authorities said.

          "body": "The Denver Nuggets took control of a back-and-forth affair against the Utah Jazz in the third quarter on their way to a 99-91 win Friday night at Pepsi Center in Denver.  The game featured seven ties and 13 lead changes prior to Denver outscoring Utah 38-16 in the third. The Jazz had a 49-46 advantage at halftime.  Facing his former team, Trey Lyles sparked the Nuggets (21-17) with a career-high 26 points in 28 minutes off the bench. The 2015 first-round pick by Utah made nine of his 17 shots and had seven rebounds.  Denver\u2019s Jamal Murray also scored 26 points on 9-of-13 shooting. He hit six of his seven 3-point attempts and had six rebounds and three assists.  Derrick Favors finished with 14 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks for Utah (16-23). Phenom rookie Donovan Mitchell, who was initially drafted by the Nuggets before his rights were traded to the Jazz, had 15 points, seven rebounds and five assists in the contest, and Ricky Rubio also scored 15 points.  Coming out of the half up by three, the Jazz upped the margin to six on a Rubio 3-pointer with 10:10 remaining in the third period. It was all Nuggets from there, however, as Denver scored 36 of the game\u2019s next 47 points to carry an 84-65 lead into the fourth quarter.  The Jazz outscored the Nuggets 26-15 in the fourth, but it was too little, too late.  With the win, the Nuggets split the season series between the clubs. The Jazz won the first two meetings before Denver routed Utah 107-83 last Tuesday.  The victory is the Nuggets\u2019 14th at home this season, a total Denver didn\u2019t reach last season until Feb. 6. The loss was the Jazz\u2019s 12th in the past 15 games.  The Nuggets will travel to play the Sacramento Kings on Saturday night, while the Jazz continue their four-game road trip with a matchup against the Miami Heat on Sunday.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Jonathan Marchessault, William Karlsson, Alex Tuch and Cody Eakin also scored goals for the Pacific Division-leading Golden Knights (28-10-2) and Smith added two assists as Vegas rebounded from its first loss in 35 days in St. Louis on Thursday night.  Malcolm Subban stopped 28 shots for his seventh consecutive win in nets, improving to 11-2-0 for the season.  Vinnie Hinostroza, Patrick Sharp, Nick Schmaltz, Jonathan Toews scored for Chicago (19-15-6), which rallied from 2-0 and 3-1 deficits to take a 4-3 lead early in the third period on Toews\u2019 goal before the Golden Knights rallied to pull it out, and improve to 13-1-1 since Dec. 1.  Jeff Glass, making his fourth straight start in goal for the Blackhawks, had 38 saves. Hinostroza also had two assists to tie his career high for points (three) in a game.  The Golden Knights peppered Glass with 11 shots in the first five minutes and a season-high 21 shots in the opening 20 minutes en route to a 2-1 first period lead. Tuch made it 1-0 at 4:44 on a double deflection as Marchessault fired a shot from the right point that Karlsson deflected into Tuch\u2019s skate and past Glass.  Marchessault, who signed a six-year, $30 million contract extension on Wednesday, made it 2-0 with his 16th goal of the season with a one-timer in the slot off a pass from Smith.  Hinostroza gave the Blackhawks some momentum when he deflected in a shot from Brandon Saad, who got the puck in the slot and whirled around and fired it to the right of the net.  Karlsson, taking advantage of some good luck, extended the Vegas lead to 3-1 at 5:55 of the second period. Smith fired a shot that went wide of the net but the puck bounced straight off the boards to a wide open Karlsson who beat Glass on his stick side.  But the Blackhawks rallied to tie it on goals by Sharp on a wrist shot from the left circle and Schmaltz on a one-timer from the same spot off a pass from the slot by Hinostroza.  Toews then gave Chicago its first lead at 4-3 just 30 seconds into the third period, firing in a cross-ice pass from Hinostroza from in front of the left circle. Eakin tied it five minutes later, firing in a shot from the slot off a pass from David Perron, setting the stage for Smith\u2019s game-winner.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Companies in New York state are \u201copen to the idea\u201d of moving the state income tax code to a payroll tax system, a senior state official told Reuters on Friday.  Governor Andrew Cuomo earlier this week said the state was exploring using a payroll tax as an alternative to the income tax in order to help residents hurt by new limits on deductions of state taxes from federal returns, under a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code passed in late December.  Cuomo, along with governors of other high-tax states such as California, has railed against the provision of the federal tax overhaul that introduced an annual cap, of $10,000, on the deduction of state and local income and property taxes, known as or SALT. The $10,000 limit, which became effective for the 2018 tax year, will hit many taxpayers in states with high incomes, property values and taxes.  Paying New York state taxes out of corporate payroll rather than an income tax would help ease the effect on residents of the new cap. New York state residents, however, would still face a $10,000 cap on deductions of local and property taxes.  According to the Cuomo administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the ongoing discussions have not yet been formalized, the chief executives of the largest employers in New York City are willing to consider the move to a payroll tax system.  \u201cYes, they want to be part of it. They want to be part of how we put it together because their employees are negatively impacted,\u201d the official said, giving greater detail for the first time to plans broadly outlined by Cuomo in his 2018 State of the State address on Wednesday.  \u201cMake no mistake, they (Washington) are aiming to hurt us,\u201d Cuomo said in his State of the State address. \u201cThis could cause people to leave the state of New York. And it could reduce our ability to attract business.\u201d  The high-tax states facing the most pain from the new limits on SALT deductions, including New York, New Jersey and California, are generally Democratic leaning.  On Thursday in California a state lawmaker introduced legislation that would allow residents to make donations instead of paying taxes to avoid the cap on deductions of state taxes.  White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said the federal government might try to block attempts to circumvent the cap, Bloomberg reported on Friday.   How tax bill ripples through industries: reut.rs/2yZs782  Cuomo on Wednesday said he will challenge the new law in court as unconstitutional on the grounds that the first federal double taxation in U.S. history violates states\u2019 rights and equal protection.  The New York corporations want to be included in the plan to move to a payroll tax, but the administration source declined to name companies, citing instead the Partnership for New York City, which represents business leaders and employers.  The partnership on Wednesday said in a statement that its members  \u201capplaud\u201d the governor\u2019s commitment to address the loss of state and local tax deductibility.  Members of the partnership include American Express, Bank of America and BlackRock.  For a tax code restructuring, New York state is also assessing whether to create new opportunities for charitable contributions to support public programs.   The senior official said that, per case law, a contribution to a state and local government for a specific purpose is a charitable contribution.  \u201cSo if you want to contribute to a school, a public school specifically, or a not-for-profit that supports a government purpose... you get a tax deduction,\u201d the official said. \u201cOr the state can create a charity that also gives to hospitals.\u201d  \u201cYou can create incentives for people to contribute to charities that would replace some government funding,\u201d the official added.  The state will also assess how individuals would build in tax preferences in a new system, the official said.  \u201cBut if you just turn yourself into a corp, limited liability corporation, and pay yourself, then you magically are now able to deduct your state and local taxes. We\u2019re looking at all of these options.\u201d  Reporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Daniel Bases and Leslie Adler"

Cuomo, along with governors of other high-tax states such as California, has railed against the provision of the federal tax overhaul that introduced an annual cap, of $10,000, on the deduction of state and local income and property taxes, known as or SALT. The $10,000 limit, which became effective for the 2018 tax year, will hit many taxpayers in states with high incomes, property values and taxes.  Paying New York state taxes out of corporate payroll rather than an income tax would help ease the effect on residents of the new cap. New York state residents, however, would still face a $10,000 cap on deductions of local and property taxes.  According to the Cuomo administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the ongoing discussions have not yet been formalized, the chief executives of the largest employers in New York City are willing to consider the move to a payroll tax system.  \u201cYes, they want to be part of it. They want to be part of how we put it together because their employees are negatively impacted,\u201d the official said, giving greater detail for the first time to plans broadly outlined by Cuomo in his 2018 State of the State address on Wednesday.  \u201cMake no mistake, they (Washington) are aiming to hurt us,\u201d Cuomo said in his State of the State address. \u201cThis could cause people to leave the state of New York. And it could reduce our ability to attract business.\u201d  The high-tax states facing the most pain from the new limits on SALT deductions, including New York, New Jersey and California, are generally Democratic leaning.  On Thursday in California a state lawmaker introduced legislation that would allow residents to make donations instead of paying taxes to avoid the cap on deductions of state taxes.  White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said the federal government might try to block attempts to circumvent the cap, Bloomberg reported on Friday.   How tax bill ripples through industries: reut.rs/2yZs782  Cuomo on Wednesday said he will challenge the new law in court as unconstitutional on the grounds that the first federal double taxation in U.S. history violates states\u2019 rights and equal protection.  The New York corporations want to be included in the plan to move to a payroll tax, but the administration source declined to name companies, citing instead the Partnership for New York City, which represents business leaders and employers.  The partnership on Wednesday said in a statement that its members  \u201capplaud\u201d the governor\u2019s commitment to address the loss of state and local tax deductibility.  Members of the partnership include American Express, Bank of America and BlackRock.  For a tax code restructuring, New York state is also assessing whether to create new opportunities for charitable contributions to support public programs.   The senior official said that, per case law, a contribution to a state and local government for a specific purpose is a charitable contribution.  \u201cSo if you want to contribute to a school, a public school specifically, or a not-for-profit that supports a government purpose... you get a tax deduction,\u201d the official said. \u201cOr the state can create a charity that also gives to hospitals.\u201d  \u201cYou can create incentives for people to contribute to charities that would replace some government funding,\u201d the official added.  The state will also assess how individuals would build in tax preferences in a new system, the official said.  \u201cBut if you just turn yourself into a corp, limited liability corporation, and pay yourself, then you magically are now able to deduct your state and local taxes. We\u2019re looking at all of these options.\u201d  Reporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Daniel Bases and Leslie Adler"

A 17-8 Spurs run over the first six minutes of the fourth quarter expanded an eight-point lead to 97-78 and turned a game that had been very competitive through 36 minutes into a runaway.  Bryn Forbes added 16 points for San Antonio (27-13), while Pau Gasol hit for 15 and Davis Bertans poured in 12.  Devin Booker paced the Suns (15-26) with 21 points. Marquese Chriss added 12 points, Josh Jackson scored 11, and Alex Len and Troy Daniels tallied 10 points apiece for Phoenix. Tyson Chandler led all players with 12 rebounds.  San Antonio led 49-42 after a first half that featured four ties and eight lead changes. The Spurs held as much as a nine-point advantage, garnered on a floater by Forbes at the 2:10 mark of the second quarter.  Leonard and Forbes each had 14 points at halftime to lead the scoring, while Booker led the Suns with 12 first-half points.  Things heated up in the final minutes of the third quarter as Phoenix used strong inside play, offensive rebounding and two baskets by Len to claw to within 72-69 with 1:24 to play in the period. Ginobili responded with back-to-back 3-pointers to create a bit of a cushion, and \u2014 after a 35-foot 3-pointer by Booker \u2014 added another from long distance to stake San Antonio to an 80-72 lead heading into the fourth.  San Antonio shot 47.1 percent from the field and sank 11 of 30 3-point tries. Phoenix made 42.2 percent of its field-goal attempts and was 7 of 30 from 3-point range.  Spurs team officials announced about an hour and a half prior to tipoff that forward LaMarcus Aldridge would be held out of the game for rest. Aldridge led San Antonio in scoring in 30 of the 38 games he has played this season.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Stevens and Watkins combined for 27 points and made 11 of 12 field-goal attempts in the first half, when the Nittany Lions (12-5, 2-2 Big Ten) opened a 16-point lead and never trailed.  Bryant McIntosh had 18 points and Scottie Lindsey had nine points for the Wildcats (10-7, 1-3), who lost their second straight.  The 6-foot-8 Stevens made 14 of 19 shots, and the Nittany Lions dominated inside with 48 points in the paint. The 6-foot-9, 254-pound Watkins has five double-doubles in his past seven games.

The Wildcats, more reliant on perimeter scoring, shot 37.1 percent from the field, including 11-of-28 from three-point range.  Vic Law had eight points, six rebounds and five assists for Northwestern. Lindsey, Northwestern\u2019s leading scorer with a 14.6 average, was 3 of 17 from the field.

          "body": "Serge Ibaka scored 21 points while DeMar DeRozan and Jonas Valanciunas finished with 20 points each as the Toronto Raptors extended their winning streak to four games with a 129-110 rout of the host Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night at the Bradley Center.  DeRozan set a franchise record with 52 points when the same teams met earlier this week in Toronto, but unlike that contest, a tight affair that the Raptors settled in overtime, this one was decided midway through the third period.  DeRozan was held to five points on 1-of-5 shooting in the opening half but exploded for 14 in the third while Valanciunas added 20 with nine rebounds as the Raptors outscored Milwaukee, 43-19 and turned a two-point lead at halftime into a comfortable, 26-point cushion heading into the fourth.  Giannis Antetokounmpo had 17 of his team-leading 24 in the first half. Malcolm Brogdon added 19 off the bench on 7-of-13 shooting and Eric Bledsoe finished with 17 for Bucks, who shot 53.2 percent and made 7-of-17 3-pointers.  Milwaukee got off to a good start and led 12-5 after Middleton fed Henson inside for a bucket with 8:31 left in the opening quarter.  The Raptors got hot from there, tearing off a 14-0 run to go up seven and led 33-24 to start the second.  An Antetokounmpo jumper from the lane capped off a 17-5 Bucks\u2019 run and gave Milwaukee a 43-41 lead with 7:32 left in the half and it was a 61-59 game at the break.  But instead of building on that momentum, the Bucks missed six of their first seven shots to open the third quarter and Toronto stretched its lead to nine with eight minutes left in the quarter as DeRozan and Valanciunas took control.  Toronto has won 16 of the last 18 regular-season meetings with the Bucks including six of the last seven contests in Milwaukee.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Anthony Mantha scored a tiebreaking goal on the power play with 11:57 remaining in the third period, leading the Detroit Red Wings past the Florida Panthers 4-2 on Friday at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.  With the victory, the Red Wings (17-16-7) extended their season-long winning streak to four games. The Panthers (17-18-5) lost their second in a row after a five-game winning streak ended against the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday.  Mantha scored on the man-advantage after Panthers center Nick Bjugstad got whistled for high sticking. The winger redirected a Martin Frk bomb in front of the net for his team-leading 14th goal of the season.  With 4:38 to go in the third, Gustav Nyquist made it 4-2 with his 13th goal of the season. Henrik Zetterberg registered the 600th assist of his career on the play.  The Red Wings were up 2-0 before the Panthers knotted the score early in the third period. Michael Matheson began Florida\u2019s comeback with a highlight-reel goal, spinning his way into the Wings\u2019 zone and around two Detroit defenders to tuck one past Jimmy Howard with two seconds remaining in the second period.  Then, just over three minutes into the third, Aleksander Barkov scored his 12th of the season to tie it on a feed from Jonathan Huberdeau. Evgenii Dadonov also picked up an assist on the play.  Despite allowing two goals, Howard made 38 saves \u2014 his most in a game since turning away 44 shots in a shootout victory over the Panthers earlier this season.  Howard hasn\u2019t allowed more than two goals in a game since Dec. 20 against the Philadelphia Flyers.  James Reimer was in net for the Panthers for the 13th consecutive game since Roberto Luongo went down with a lower-body injury. Reimer, who left the Panthers\u2019 last game Tuesday in the second period with a neck injury, turned away 15 shots as his record dropped to 11-11-4.  Andreas Athanasiou got the scoring started early for Detroit, striking 42 seconds after the first puck drop. Mike Green flipped the puck from the Wings\u2019 zone the way of Athanasiou, who got around Panthers defender Aaron Ekblad to beat Reimer on the backhand for his ninth goal of the season. The 23-year-old has four goals in his last four games.  Athanasiou played a part in the Wings\u2019 second goal as well, dishing a feed from Dylan Larkin to Tomas Tatar, who had the net wide open for his 11th tally of the season. Larkin\u2019s assist was his team-leading 28th.  The Panthers faced unusual circumstances leading up to the game as they weren\u2019t able to travel from Boston to Detroit until Friday morning because of a blizzard that led to their Thursday matchup against the Bruins being postponed.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Daniel Sprong opened the scoring in the second and added an insurance goal in the third. Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby scored later in the second for the Penguins (21-19-3), whose fifth win in the last 13 games pulled them within a point of the idle Carolina Hurricanes for the second Eastern Conference wild card spot.  Crosby had assists on the Penguins\u2019 other three goals, and goalie Tristan Jarry stopped all 31 shots he faced in recording his second career shutout.  The Islanders (20-18-4) have lost a season-high five straight games, during which they\u2019ve been outscored 25-8. New York may have absorbed an even bigger loss in the second period when star center Josh Bailey left with a lower body injury. Bailey earned NHL second star honors in December.  Islanders goalie Jaroslav Halak recorded 34 saves.  The Penguins scored the only goal they\u2019d need 41 seconds into the second period when Crosby picked up the puck in the neutral zone, raced up the right side and dished near the faceoff circles to Sprong, who fired into the open left corner of the net as Halak was stuck leaning to the right.  Malkin extended the lead to 2-0 less than three minutes later, when he took a pass from Crosby, went to one knee at the left faceoff circle and fired a shot past the glove of Halak, who was screened by Thomas Hickey.  Crosby produced one of his signature moves to give the Penguins a 3-0 lead with 4:10 remaining in the period. After passing to Sprong, Crosby moved toward the net and was in perfect position to put back the rebound of a Sprong shot that bounced off the post.  \u2014 Field Level Media"

          "title": "Maduro says Venezuela will issue $5.9 billion in oil-backed cryptocurrency",
          "body": "CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro said on Friday that Venezuela would issue 100 million units of its new oil-backed cryptocurrency in coming days, although it is unclear whether any investors will want to purchase the \u201cpetro\u201d at a time when the OPEC member is going through a deep economic crisis and its leftist government has little credibility.      Socialist Maduro surprised many last month when he announced the launch of the cryptocurrency, to be backed by Venezuela\u2019s oil, gas, gold and diamond reserves, as a way to circumvent U.S. sanctions that have hurt Venezuela\u2019s access to international banks.  Maduro specified on Friday that each unit of the currency would be pegged to Venezuela\u2019s oil basket, which this week averaged $59.07 per barrel, according to the oil ministry. That implies the total cryptocurrency issued would be worth just over $5.9 billion.  There is much confusion, however, over how the mechanism will work. Opposition politicians have already panned the project as a fanciful idea doomed to fail and useless at getting food to the millions who are suffering from product shortages and the world\u2019s highest inflation.     Maduro says the cryptocurrency will usher in the \u201c21st century\u201d and boost Venezuela\u2019s access to hard currency.      \u201cI have ordered the emission of 100 million petros with the legal sustenance of Venezuela\u2019s certified and legalized oil wealth,\u201d said Maduro in a state television address.     \u201cEvery petro will be equal in value to Venezuela\u2019s oil barrel.\u201d     Venezuela has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, according to OPEC, and makes some 95 percent of its export revenue from oil. Critics say the government has squandered wealth from a decade-long oil boom and that without reforms any influx of resources will also be burned through.      Strict currency controls have forced people onto the black market, on which a dollar can buy 137,000 bolivars. The country\u2019s strongest official rate, meanwhile, is 10 bolivars per dollar.      That fall in value combined with money printing by the central bank is behind what many analysts are measuring as hyperinflation.  Local economic consultancy Ecoanalitica said prices rose more than 80 percent in December alone. Money supply, according to the central bank, was up more than 1,000 percent last year.      Maduro said the cryptocurrency issuance would take place through virtual exchanges in the coming day, but did not give further details.      Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and their success relies on transparency, clear rules and equal treatment of all involved.  Writing by Girish Gupta; Editing by Alexandra Ulmer and Lisa Shumaker"

          "body": "SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea agreed on Friday to hold official talks with South Korea next week, the first in more than two years, hours after Washington and Seoul delayed a military exercise amid a standoff over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told U.S. media it was too early to tell if the inter-Korea meeting could open the way for future talks involving the United States, but he stressed that if such talks came about they would have to be aimed at North Korean denuclearization.   South Korea said North Korea had sent its consent for the talks to be held next Tuesday at the border truce village of Panmunjom. The last time the two Koreas engaged in official talks was in December 2015.  The two sides are expected to discuss the Winter Olympics, to be held in South Korea next month, and inter-Korean relations, South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told reporters.  North Korea asked for further negotiations about the meeting to be carried out via documented exchanges, Baik said.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened the way for talks with South Korea in a New Year\u2019s Day speech in which he called for reduced tensions and flagged the North\u2019s possible participation in the Winter Olympics.  But Kim remained steadfast on the issue of nuclear weapons, saying the North would mass-produce nuclear missiles for operational deployment and warned he would launch a nuclear strike if his country was threatened.  U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called the proposed inter-Korean talks a \u201cgood thing,\u201d and he and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in announced that annual large-scale military drills would now take place after the Olympics.  The North sees the drills as preparations for invasion and justification for its weapons programs that it conducts in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.  Trump, who hurled fresh insults at the North Korean leader this week, took credit for any dialogue that takes place.  \u201cDoes anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn\u2019t firm, strong and willing to commit our total \u2018might\u2019 against the North,\u201d Trump tweeted.  Speaking to CNN, Tillerson made clear that Washington was also open to talks with North Korea, but warned that while it aimed to resolve the crisis diplomatically, \u201cthose diplomatic efforts are backed by a strong military option if necessary.\u201d  Tillerson said future talks involving the United States could allow North Korea to \u201cchart a way for themselves to a more secure future, a more prosperous future.\u201d He added: \u201cThey do know how to reach us if and when they are ready to engage with us as well.\u201d  Tillerson said how such talks might begin had yet to be determined, but North Korea would have to signal it understood that they would be aimed at \u201cfinal, full denuclearization.\u201d  He told the Associated Press it remained to be seen whether the North Koreans would want to talk about more than the Olympics next week.  The meeting could be a \u201cvehicle through which they would like to tell us that they would like to have some discussions,\u201d the AP quoted Tillerson as saying.   \u201cIt could be meaningful, it could be important. It could be a meeting about the Olympics and nothing else happens.\u201d   North Korea says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression, and it regularly threatens to destroy the United States and its two key Asia allies, Japan and South Korea.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang welcomed North and South Korea \u201ctaking positive steps to improve ties,\u201d and said the postponement of the exercises was \u201cwithout doubt a good thing.\u201d  China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said it would limit exports of crude oil, refined oil products, steel and other metals to North Korea, in line with tough new sanctions imposed by the United Nations.  Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera sounded a note of caution about the proposed talks.  \u201cI think what is important is to maintain a firm defense posture,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cNorth Korea goes through phases of apparent dialogue and provocation, but either way, North Korea is continuing its nuclear and missile development. We have no intention of weakening our warning and surveillance.\u201d  Earlier this week, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington had heard reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile.  South Korea\u2019s Defence Ministry has said it had yet to see any evidence of an imminent missile launch.  Analysts with the website 38 North, which tracks North Korea, reported Pyongyang may be preparing to test a rocket engine at a facility in Sohae, North Pyongan province, where all of the North\u2019s satellite launches have taken place since 2012.  Commercial satellite imagery from Dec. 25 showed a rail-mounted environment shelter had been moved away from a test stand, indicating that an engine test may be in the near future, the website said, rather than a new rocket launch suspected in recent media reports.

Marcus Smart had 18 points off the bench to pace the Celtics. Kyrie Irving finished with 16 points (on 6-of-16 shooting) and eight assists and Aron Baynes doubled up with 11 points and 10 rebounds.  Boston (32-10) followed up its 102-88 thumping of the defending Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers at home on Wednesday with its fifth straight victory.

Nestled in the western central highlands of the Sierra Madre, Paracho is seeing a boom in guitar sales following the worldwide success of \u201cCoco.\u201d  The film follows a boy who accidentally finds himself in the land of the dead during the Mexican celebrations for the Dia de los Muertos. Central to the plot is the boy\u2019s trusty Paracho-style guitar.  The 16th century-style guitars have been a way of life in the town of 30,000 for centuries. According to legend, a priest with the original Spanish conquerors decided locals in the village should be taught a craft to support their economy.   Paracho soon gained fame as Mexico\u2019s capital for the manufacture of stringed instruments, and \u201cCoco\u201d has now brought its craftsmen global fame and booming sales, artisans said.  The film, released by Walt Disney Co\u2019s Pixar, has grossed more than $550 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. It ranks as the highest grossing movie in Mexico ever.   Costs for the hand-made guitars range from around 2,000 Mexican pesos ($104 dollars) to those made with fine wood that fetch up to 20,000 pesos ($1,042 dollars).  Due to popular request, local artisans have given the traditionally black guitar a Day-Of-The-Dead twist by painting the instrument white and adding a cartoon of the traditional Mexican skull on its front.

Temperatures were expected to be 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit below average across the northeastern United States for the next several days.

Stay at home.\u201d  In much of New England on Friday, the highs reached only into the single digits or teens Fahrenheit, but wind chills made  it feel below zero in many places.  \u201cIt can be very dangerous,\u201d said Dan Pydynowski, a meteorologist with private forecasting service AccuWeather. \u201cAny kind of exposed skin can freeze in a couple of minutes.\u201d   There were noticeably fewer tourists on Friday afternoon in New York City\u2019s Times Square, which is usually thronged with visitors.  Arjun Shah, a 22-year-old Briton, studies in Indiana but had never visited the U.S. East Coast. He flew in to New York City, where temperatures have been below freezing since Christmas Day, just 24 hours before the blizzard struck.  \u201cOh it\u2019s so bad! It\u2019s not this bad in London,\u201d Shah said, shivering while taking a break from snapping photos of Times Square.  In Washington, bundled-up tourists ventured onto the frozen Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial before being shooed away by a National Park Service ranger.   The memorial, also normally busy with visitors, was mostly vacant with temperatures in the teens and bone-chilling winds that sent American flags whipping straight out from their poles.  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt this cold, ever,\u201d said Zoie Irwin, a 19-year-old student from San Francisco State University as she huddled with friends.  At the nearby National World War II Memorial, Varun Solipuram, a 31-year-old native of Hyderabad, India, who studies in California, said he was taken aback by snow in the bright winter sun.  \u201cIt\u2019s really beautiful,\u201d Solipuram said.   The storm that swept in on Thursday with gusts of more than 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour), dumped 22 inches (56 cms) of snow in parts of Maine and 17 inches (43 cm) in parts of Massachusetts, before ending on Friday, the National Weather Service said.  The storm was powered by a rapid drop in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d  Cities from Houston to Boston have stepped up efforts to bring the homeless to shelters. Authorities said that three homeless people in Texas died from exposure to the cold.     Canada\u2019s largest city, Toronto, scrambled to find emergency shelter for the homeless as temperatures dropped to record lows after the sweeping storm knocked out power to tens of thousands in eastern provinces and destroyed coastal roads.  Numbing temperatures have also had some unusual effects: cold-shocked iguanas fell out of trees in Florida and wildlife officials in the state said they had rescued more than 200 stunned sea turtles from freezing waters.  Schools in New York were open, while children in Boston and Baltimore enjoyed a second day of canceled classes. Schools in Newark, New Jersey, opened two hours later than usual.  Commuters riding railways serving New York and Boston\u2019s suburbs endured extensive delays as crews worked to repair frozen equipment and clear snow-covered tracks.  New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports resumed flights on Friday after closing during whiteout conditions the day before. More than 1,500 flights at U.S. East Coast airports had been canceled by Friday evening, most at the New York area\u2019s three major airports and Boston Logan International Airport.   Nearly 500 members of the National Guard were activated to assist with the emergency response along the East Coast, including 200 in New York state, authorities said.

          "body": "PARACHO, Mexico (Reuters) - Pixar\u2019s hit film \u201cCoco\u201d has struck all the right notes in the tiny Mexican hamlet of Paracho, home to the traditional Mexican guitar made famous in the movie.   Nestled in the western central highlands of the Sierra Madre, Paracho is seeing a boom in guitar sales following the worldwide success of \u201cCoco.\u201d  The film follows a boy who accidentally finds himself in the land of the dead during the Mexican celebrations for the Dia de los Muertos. Central to the plot is the boy\u2019s trusty Paracho-style guitar.  The 16th century-style guitars have been a way of life in the town of 30,000 for centuries. According to legend, a priest with the original Spanish conquerors decided locals in the village should be taught a craft to support their economy.   Paracho soon gained fame as Mexico\u2019s capital for the manufacture of stringed instruments, and \u201cCoco\u201d has now brought its craftsmen global fame and booming sales, artisans said.  The film, released by Walt Disney Co\u2019s Pixar, has grossed more than $550 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. It ranks as the highest grossing movie in Mexico ever.   Costs for the hand-made guitars range from around 2,000 Mexican pesos ($104 dollars) to those made with fine wood that fetch up to 20,000 pesos ($1,042 dollars).  Due to popular request, local artisans have given the traditionally black guitar a Day-Of-The-Dead twist by painting the instrument white and adding a cartoon of the traditional Mexican skull on its front.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Veteran former U.S. talk show host David Letterman will return to television on Jan. 12 in a new Netflix show where his first guest will be former U.S. President Barack Obama, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Friday.  The company\u2019s shares rose as much as 2 percent to a record  of $209.72.  Called \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman,\u201d the six-episode series will also feature interviews with actor George Clooney, rapper Jay-Z, radio shock jock Howard Stern, comedian Tina Fey and Pakistani education activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, the streaming service said.  Netflix has been spending heavily to produce and acquire content as it races to dominate streaming television and beat competition from traditional media and other streaming players such as Hulu and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Prime Video.  Letterman\u2019s interview with Obama will mark the former president\u2019s first television talk show appearance since he left office in January last year.  Letterman, 70, left his job as host of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d in May 2015, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family after more than 30 years on late night television.  His return to television for Netflix was announced in August 2017, when the quick-witted host said that Pope Francis and President Donald Trump would be top of his wish-list for the series.  Netflix said the new series would consist of 60-minute episodes centered around \u201cone extraordinary figure whom Dave finds fascinating\u201d and that the interviews would take place  both inside and outside a studio setting.  The company, home to shows such as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d streams to most countries in the world and has a customer base of about 115.6 million.  The company\u2019s shares have kept pace with its user growth and have risen nearly 60 percent in the past one year.

          "title": "Cold comfort: U.S. homeless shelters overwhelmed in brutal weather",
          "body": "BOSTON (Reuters) - In the common room of Boston\u2019s Pine Street Inn homeless shelter, dozens of blue vinyl pads and folded-up cots stood ready on Friday for another night\u2019s rush of people fleeing the deadly cold that has gripped the region for almost two weeks.  The four-story building, whose 160-foot (49-meter) Tuscan-style tower is an icon of the Boston skyline, is filled with enough beds to sleep close to 500 people.  But they are not enough: Pine Street has packed in up to 100 extra people each night since Christmas, as harsh subfreezing temperatures gripped New England and much of the rest of the eastern United States.  The cold snap has been blamed for the death of at least three homeless men, in Texas and North Carolina, according to officials and local news media. It has provided a vivid illustration of a nationwide problem, as homelessness in United States rose in 2017 for the first time in seven years.  Pine Street staff members normally ask healthy guests to clear out during the daytime. But temperatures in Boston have remained below freezing for 11 days straight, and are forecast to dip below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 17.8 degrees Celsius) over the weekend, prompting the shelter to allow people to stay inside throughout the bitter cold and a powerful blizzard that struck on Thursday.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to die in the street,\u201d said shelter spokeswoman Barbara Trevisan. \u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of life and death.\u201d  Homelessness is on the rise in the United States, according to federal survey data released last month, which said 553,742 people lacked homes on a given night in 2017.  That figure was up 1 percent from 2016, an increase that reflects rising housing prices in cities from New York to San Francisco.   Amid the brutal cold, officials in Boston, New York and other major cities are stepping up their efforts to find homeless people on the streets and encourage them into shelters.  Homelessness has surged to a record high in New York, with more than 130,000 people finding themselves homeless at some point in 2017, according to the Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy and service group.  In the face of that rise, the city is stepping up its response, planning to add another 450 beds for homeless people from its current 1,100, in a mix of private and public shelters, said Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services. During the current cold snap it has doubled the number of people trying to persuade homeless people on the street to come in to shelters.  \u201cWe\u2019re currently at record homelessness levels, so capacity is tight and that is definitely a concern,\u201d said Giselle Routhier, policy director at the Coalition.  In Boston, dozens lined up in the Pine Street Inn on Friday for a lunch of soup and sandwiches, some of the 2,500 meals the facility is serving each day during this period of high demand, 500 more than usual.  The cost of food for extra meals, doubling staff levels during the day and sending out more crews to find people sleeping on the streets, has caused the facility to overrun its budget by about 25 percent during the past two weeks, said shelter manager Josh O\u2019Brien.  \u201cIt\u2019s a big strain,\u201d said O\u2019Brien, who said he has not experienced a period of intense cold this long in the 25 years he has run homeless shelters.   Tom Smith, 55, who is has been staying at Pine Street since being released from prison in August, credits the shelter with keeping him alive during the cold snap. During a prior period of homelessness, he had lived in a tent that likely would not have survived this week\u2019s blizzard.  \u201cWith the weight of the snow, the tent would have collapsed, I couldn\u2019t have started a fire,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHaving a facility like this is the best thing you can have. It\u2019s a lifesaver.\u201d  Reporting by Scott Malone; Additional reporting by Jonathan Allen and Amr Alfiky in New York"

          "body": "Joel Embiid scored 23 points and collected nine rebounds, JJ Redick added 21 points and the Philadelphia 76ers routed the Detroit Pistons 114-78 on Friday night at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.  Ben Simmons contributed 19 points and nine assists, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot scored 13 points while Dario Saric and Robert Covington had 11 each for the 76ers, who won their fourth straight game and returned to .500 at 19-19. Simmons scored in double figures for the 33rd time this season while Embiid scored at least 20 points for the fifth consecutive game and the 22nd time this season.  The Sixers beat Detroit for the third time this season.  The Pistons played without guard Reggie Jackson (sprained right ankle) and it was obvious how much they missed him.  Tobias Harris led the Pistons (20-17) with 14 points while Ish Smith and Langston Galloway added 11 apiece. Andre Drummond had 10.  With the Sixers leading by 36 points heading into the fourth quarter, both teams emptied their bench for the entire final stanza.  The Sixers pulled ahead 69-35 in the early minutes of the third before the Pistons reeled off nine straight points. Since the Sixers have had trouble hanging onto leads all season, coach Brett Brown called timeout to halt the run.  Covington hit his third 3-pointer to put the Sixers up 87-50 with 3:59 left in the third quarter.  Amazingly, the Sixers led 94-54 for their largest advantage all season and there was still more than an entire quarter to play. The Sixers\u2019 36-point lead through three quarters was the team\u2019s largest through 36 minutes since Feb. 20, 2008 against the New York Knicks.  Simmons knocked down his first five shots and the Sixers bolted to a 42-15 lead early in the second. The advantage swelled to 32 on a pair of occasions.  Philadelphia led by 30 points, 62-32, at halftime for its largest advantage since 2012 at the break.  Simmons and Embiid had 15 points apiece, though Embiid was clearly grimacing with his sore right hand as the Sixers went into the locker room.  The Pistons\u2019 first half output was their lowest of the season.  \u2014 Field Level Media  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Corey Sanders scored a season-high 23 points and hit two clutch baskets in the final two minutes to lead Rutgers to 64-60 victory over Wisconsin on Friday night at the Louis Brown Athletic Center in Piscataway, N.J.  Sanders recorded his third 20-point showing of the season. The junior guard made 10 of 19 shots and both 3-point attempts as Rutgers (11-6, 1-3 Big Ten) snapped a three-game losing streak since beating Seton Hall on Dec. 16  His two big shots occurred after Wisconsin forged a 53-53 deadlock with 2:03 remaining on a 3-pointer by freshman guard Brad Davison to cap a 7-0 run.  Following Davison\u2019s shot, Sanders gave Rutgers the lead for good with a mid-range jumper with 1:53 remaining. After a missed 3-pointer by Wisconsin\u2019s Brevin Pritzl and a missed layup by Nate Reuvers, Sanders made it 58-53 with a long 3-pointer over Ethan Happ with 54 seconds remaining.  Senior forward Deshawn Freeman added 15 points for Rutgers, which shot 46.3 percent (25 of 54) and did not trail for the final 13 1/2 minutes.  Davison and Pritzl led the Badgers (9-8, 2-2) with 13 points apiece. Happ added 10 points and 10 rebounds but also committed a career-worst seven turnovers, and Reuvers scored 10 points.  Wisconsin held a 36-24 advantage in the paint and shot 48.9 percent (23 of 47). The Badgers missed their first 11 3-point attempts, finished 2 of 13 from behind the arc and committed 14 turnovers.  Rutgers never trailed after Sanders hit a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 13:37 remaining for a 36-35 lead. Sanders\u2019 3-pointer was part of a 9-0 run when Wisconsin went scoreless for a little over three minutes.  The Badgers cut the lead to one on two occasions, but Rutgers held a 53-46 edge when Eugene Omoruyi stole Davison\u2019s pass with 3:45 left and Freeman converted a dunk three seconds later.  Sanders scored 10 points in a slow-paced first half, which ended with Rutgers taking a 25-24 lead. Sanders made 5 of 11 shots before the break, including a short jumper near the baseline in the final seconds of the half.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "TORONTO/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada\u2019s largest city, Toronto, scrambled to find emergency shelter for the homeless as temperatures dropped to record lows after a \u201cweather bomb\u201d knocked out power to tens of thousands in eastern provinces and destroyed coastal roads.  From Halifax to Ottawa, workers struggled on Friday to clear snow and restore power lines downed by winds gusting up to hurricane strengths of 105 miles per hour (169 km per hour) in some areas of Nova Scotia, driving huge storm surges, according to Environment Canada.  The brutal conditions were caused by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a \u201cbombogenesis\u201d, or a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d  The powerful blizzard came up the East Coast before hitting Canada\u2019s Maritime provinces, causing havoc in the U.S. Northeast where it killed at least 18 people and caused temperatures to plummet as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius) in some areas.  In Toronto, winds pushed temperatures down to a frigid -21 degrees Celsius (minus 9 degrees Fahrenheit), putting people at risk of frost bite in an icy spell expected to last through Sunday morning.     The city said it would open a downtown Toronto armory to serve as a homeless shelter, though warned it would not be ready until Monday. Authorities urged people to go to two other downtown warming centers over the weekend and arranged for two overnight outreach crews to help people in need.   Toronto Mayor John Tory came under fire for not opening the armory sooner and for voting against a measure to do so in December.  As temperatures continued to drop, nurse and housing advocate Cathy Crowe said she was worried people would freeze to death on the streets.  \u201cIt\u2019s worse than anything I\u2019ve seen in 30 years as a street nurse,\u201d said Crowe.  Environment Canada has issued an extreme cold warning for Toronto where the winds made the temperature feel like minus 31 Celsius (minus 24 Fahrenheit) on Friday.   The cold contributed to the deaths of an elderly couple in Bluewater, a town on the shore of Lake Huron that is some 200 km (120 miles) west of Toronto.   Grant Triebner, 90, died from a heart attack while outside his home and then his wife Ada, 83, froze to death while searching for him, broadcaster CP24 reported.  Temperatures also plunged in Montreal and Ottawa. Eastern parts of Quebec province were hit with up to 50 cm (20 inches) of snow, according to Environment Canada.   Around 11,400 utility customers in Nova Scotia were still without power as of 7:15 p.m. EST on Friday, down from 85,000 earlier in the day, Nova Scotia Power reported.   Thousands remained without power in the neighboring provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec, utility companies said.    Reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny in Toronto and Allison Lampert in Montreal.

          "body": "CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro said on Friday that Venezuela would issue 100 million units of its new oil-backed cryptocurrency in coming days, although it is unclear whether any investors will want to purchase the \u201cpetro\u201d at a time when the OPEC member is going through a deep economic crisis and its leftist government has little credibility.      Socialist Maduro surprised many last month when he announced the launch of the cryptocurrency, to be backed by Venezuela\u2019s oil, gas, gold and diamond reserves, as a way to circumvent U.S. sanctions that have hurt Venezuela\u2019s access to international banks.  Maduro specified on Friday that each unit of the currency would be pegged to Venezuela\u2019s oil basket, which this week averaged $59.07 per barrel, according to the oil ministry. That implies the total cryptocurrency issued would be worth just over $5.9 billion.  There is much confusion, however, over how the mechanism will work. Opposition politicians have already panned the project as a fanciful idea doomed to fail and useless at getting food to the millions who are suffering from product shortages and the world\u2019s highest inflation.     Maduro says the cryptocurrency will usher in the \u201c21st century\u201d and boost Venezuela\u2019s access to hard currency.      \u201cI have ordered the emission of 100 million petros with the legal sustenance of Venezuela\u2019s certified and legalized oil wealth,\u201d said Maduro in a state television address.     \u201cEvery petro will be equal in value to Venezuela\u2019s oil barrel.\u201d     Venezuela has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, according to OPEC, and makes some 95 percent of its export revenue from oil. Critics say the government has squandered wealth from a decade-long oil boom and that without reforms any influx of resources will also be burned through.      Strict currency controls have forced people onto the black market, on which a dollar can buy 137,000 bolivars. The country\u2019s strongest official rate, meanwhile, is 10 bolivars per dollar.      That fall in value combined with money printing by the central bank is behind what many analysts are measuring as hyperinflation.  Local economic consultancy Ecoanalitica said prices rose more than 80 percent in December alone. Money supply, according to the central bank, was up more than 1,000 percent last year.      Maduro said the cryptocurrency issuance would take place through virtual exchanges in the coming day, but did not give further details.      Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and their success relies on transparency, clear rules and equal treatment of all involved.  Writing by Girish Gupta; Editing by Alexandra Ulmer and Lisa Shumaker"

          "body": "(Reuters) - An illegal immigrant acquitted in a fatal San Francisco shooting, in a verdict condemned by President Donald Trump, was sentenced to three years in prison on a lesser gun charge on Friday.  The 45-year-old Mexican national, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, has been held behind bars since his arrest in the July 2015 shooting death of Kate Steinle, and was fully credited for the three-year sentence, a spokesman for the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office said.  The San Francisco Sheriff\u2019s Department handed Garcia Zarate over to U.S. Marshals on Friday on warrants stemming from federal gun charged related to the Steinle incident, sheriff\u2019s department spokeswoman Nancy Crowley said.  The completion of the three-year sentence, handed down by a San Francisco judge, reflected both the time Garcia Zarate has been held since his arrest and certain credits, the spokesman for the district attorney\u2019s office, Alex Bastian, said.  A San Francisco Superior Court jury had found Garcia Zarate not guilty of murder and manslaughter charges in connection with Steinle\u2019s death. Jurors found him guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  Garcia Zarate had found the gun that killed Steinle. It accidentally discharged, with the bullet ricocheting off the ground at a crowded pier before striking the 32-year-old woman, his defense attorneys have said.  Prosecutors claimed Garcia Zarate intentionally fired the gun, but they said they accepted the jury\u2019s verdict.  Trump, who used the Steinle case as a rallying cry against the policies of so-called sanctuary cities for immigrants during his successful run for the presidency, has called the jury\u2019s verdict \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d   Just days after he was acquitted in San Francisco, Garcia Zarate was indicted on federal charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm\u00a0and being an illegal immigrant in possession of a firearm.  The latest criminal counts against Zarate would not violate the constitutional protection against double jeopardy, which prohibits being tried twice on the same charges, because they differed legally from the state court charges, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman said last month.   A representative for the Office of the Federal Public Defender could not immediately be reached for comment.  Garcia Zarate faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on each charge if convicted.  Immigration agents have vowed to eventually deport Garcia Zarate, who first came to the United States as a juvenile and was deported multiple times.

State prosecutor Javier Olea said the young men had been arrested by Chilpancingo police last Saturday after a brawl at a Christmas fair and officers were suspected of later murdering them. Their bodies were found on Thursday. At least one other young man has disappeared.   State and federal police and military forces took over security operations in Chilpancingo on Thursday after more than 100 local police officers were suspended and put under investigation in the case, a state police spokesman said on Friday.   A growing number of criminal groups in Guerrero are battling over territory used to grow opium poppies for heroin production.  Guerrero is one of the most violent states in Mexico. It is not uncommon for state, federal and military forces to replace local security forces suspected of corruption and ties to Mexico\u2019s powerful gangs.  On Thursday, protests were held against local police and relatives of two missing youths told reporters they suspected police were involved in their disappearance.    In the nearby city of Iguala in 2014, 43 Mexican students were rounded up by corrupt police, who handed them over to a gang that burnt them in a nearby dump, according to a federal investigation.  Clashes between rival drug gangs contributed to a record high number of murders in Mexico last year.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gun violence in major U.S. cities fell in 2017 as police used the latest crime-fighting software combined with a revival of old-fashioned community policing to build trust with a skeptical public.  Law enforcement officials and criminologists credit that dual approach with helping extend the decades-long reduction in crime in New York City and reducing gun violence in Chicago by 20 percent in 2017.  Crime has dropped precipitously across the United States since peaking in 1991, though some cities have lagged and others have experienced sudden spikes.  Chicago became a symbol of U.S. gun violence after homicides soared nearly 60 percent in 2016, drawing frequent criticism from Donald Trump during his campaign for the presidency and after he was elected.  Since then, the third-largest U.S. city has revamped policing policies and developed a sophisticated integration of crime-fighting software and hardware such as cameras. It has also built ties to the public through events such as a Halloween party that drew 500 kids to a police station in a high-crime district.  While there is no hard evidence that those initiatives were responsible, homicides in Chicago dropped 16 percent in 2017 to 650. That still outnumbered homicides in the two largest U.S. cities, New York and Los Angeles, combined.  \u201cThere was a promise to never relive 2016,\u201d said Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for Chicago police. \u201cThat was a moment in time we never want to repeat in terms of violence.\u201d   While Chicago has seen volatile swings, New York has experienced a consistent reduction in crime, in sharp contrast with a bygone reputation as the country\u2019s murder and mayhem capital.  On Friday the New York Police Department reported 290 murders in 2017, down 13 percent from 2016 and 87 percent from 1990, when a record 2,262 people were killed.   The New York Police Department called 2017 the safest year in nearly seven decades even as arrests decreased by nearly 400 per day from their high point seven years ago.  Experts do not entirely understand the trend but point to a number of likely factors, including CompStat, the computer analysis of crime data that was developed by New York police in 1994 and has since been replicated in other cities.  CompStat gives police daily reports on how they are performing, enabling them to quickly identify trends and deploy officers to trouble spots.  Data-driven, evidence-based policing has advanced further with the help of crime-predicting software like HunchLab and gunfire-detection system ShotSpotter.  Technology \u201chelps us to link cases quicker, deploy faster and deploy smarter,\u201d Dermot Shea, the NYPD\u2019s chief of crime control strategies, told a news conference on Friday.  The public uproar over police shootings of unarmed black men across the United States in recent years has also convinced police they must adopt neighborhood or community policing.   That aims to improve relationships between police and residents of high-crime districts and reduce animosity toward police to gain more co-operation in solving and preventing crimes.  \u201cTechnology is great ... but I think the best thing going for us is the ability for the police officers to establish and have relationships with the people in this great city,\u201d New York Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said.  Chicago studied the best practices of the New York and Los Angeles police departments, incorporating much of New York\u2019s neighborhood policing model and the use of predictive crime software by Los Angeles.  In February, Chicago rolled out so-called Strategic Decision Support Centers, which integrate gunfire detection and predictive crime software with the city\u2019s extensive network of cameras. Before year\u2019s end the centers had expanded to six of the city\u2019s 22 districts.The program started in notoriously high crime districts such as Englewood and Harrison, where police said crime fell by 43 percent and 26 percent, respectively, in 2017.  Now, when a trigger is pulled, Chicago police are alerted within 30 seconds by ShotSpotter, and the information is relayed to the smartphones of patrol officers within a minute, Guglielmi said.  Meanwhile, with cameras switched on in the gunshot\u2019s vicinity, the same data is run through the HunchLab system. Police and criminologists from the University of Chicago analyze the data in real time, dispatching updates to patrol officers, Guglielmi said.   Chicago police are now frequently responding to incidents as much as three minutes before witnesses report gunfire to the 911 emergency number, he said.  The Chicago experience appears to be \u201ca promising step forward,\u201d said Max Kapustin of the University of Chicago\u2019s Crime Lab.  \u201cCertainly in the case of Chicago and specifically in the district of Englewood, there\u2019s a lot of suggestive evidence that this led to those reductions and seems like a really meaningful way forward for reducing crime,\u201d Kapustin said.

          "title": "CES kicks off with no lead women speakers or code of conduct",
          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The technology industry\u2019s premier annual gathering kicks off next week with no women leading the keynote sessions and no code of conduct that might prevent incidents of sexual harassment, despite efforts by organizers to cast the show as a more inclusive event.  CES, the showcase for the latest consumer electronics from televisions to self-driving cars, is known for mostly male attendees and female models known as \u2018booth babes\u2019 showing off the new technology.  It has attracted criticism for not making itself more welcoming for women or toning down its sexualized atmosphere even as the issue of harassment and assault has grabbed headlines in the last six months and propelled the #MeToo movement into life.  \u201cThe fact that this large global gathering of tech leaders is totally ignoring this issue makes them completely tone deaf and irresponsible,\u201d said Liliana Aide Monge, chief executive of California coding school Sabio, who is skipping CES for the second year in a row because of the lack of women and minority speakers.  The organizers of CES, which opens its doors to nearly 200,000 attendees in Las Vegas on Tuesday, drew criticism last month from executives at Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and other tech companies for a keynote list dominated by white men. CES made a concerted push to diversify its entire speaker lineup, but ultimately failed to find a high-ranking female executive for an individual keynote address.  \u201cTo keynote at CES, the speaker must head (president/CEO level) a large entity who has name recognition in the industry,\u201d said Karen Chupka, who oversees the event as senior vice president at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), in a blog post a month ago. \u201cAs upsetting as it is, there is a limited pool when it comes to women in these positions. We feel your pain. It bothers us, too. The tech industry and every industry must do better.\u201d  On top of that, CES also will go forward without creating a code of conduct, a mechanism several conferences in technology and other industries have adopted in recent years to set rules for behavior for attendees, from guidelines on using inclusive language in presentations to requirements that attendees wear name tags at all events, even after hours, to deter misconduct.   \u201cIt\u2019s sad that CES doesn\u2019t have a code of conduct,\u201d said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of ReadySet, a diversity-focused consulting firm. \u201cThey have a lot of influence. If they\u2019re choosing not to leverage that to promote diversity and inclusion at large, that communicates to the rest of the industry that maybe it isn\u2019t as necessary as we keep saying that it is.\u201d  Evidence of the effect on shows\u2019 safety and tone is mostly anecdotal, but several conferences with these codes, including hacker convention DEF CON, CoreOS Fest and Cloud Foundry Summit, say they have removed attendees after reports of harassment.   The stakes are high for the technology industry, rocked in the past year by a sexual harassment scandal at Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and misconduct by some prominent Silicon Valley investors.   The organizers of CES say they expect attendees to heed their own companies\u2019 standards of business conduct and will kick out anyone who behaves poorly, but will not introduce a set of guidelines.  \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily have specific rules because we assume everyone will be held accountable to the standards of being in an office,\u201d said Chupka.   \u201cUnacceptable\u201d behavior would be addressed by the executive team and legal counsel as necessary, the CTA said. \u201cWe have the right at any time to revoke a show badge and/or trespass an individual.\u201d CES notes that it has received no reports of sexual harassment at the event in recent years.   Women subjected to uncomfortable situations at or near past CES gatherings told Reuters that they did not report incidents because they were too used to it or did not recognize there was a way to do so.  To change that thinking, the show is debuting a security app that lets attendees report issues from crimes to broken elevators. While there will be no effort to promote the app specifically as a way to report sexual harassment, attendees may do so, and CES said its lawyers will be ready to act.  The need for a code of conduct became apparent at Finland\u2019s Slush tech startup event in 2016 when multiple women spoke up about being inappropriately touched and receiving unwanted propositions for sex by male attendees as well as being ignored by investors who were only interested in working with male entrepreneurs.   The following year, it doubled security, trained staff on how to handle reports of harassment and instituted a code of conduct, including a requirement to wear name badges at all times as a way to make it easier for attendees to identify a harasser.  A similar approach has been adopted by some in the U.S. tech industry. Salesforce.com Inc\u2019s (CRM.N) Dreamforce event, second only to CES in attendee numbers, added a code of conduct in 2014, while film, tech and music conference South by Southwest added one in 2016. Meanwhile, large conferences run by Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and RSA Security have not adopted such a code.  It remains to be seen if CES\u2019s lack of a code of conduct will prove costly.   Las Vegas\u2019 reputation for excess is part of the problem, said Liz Lopez, a tech marketing professional who has attended several industry conferences in the city.  \u201cPeople are over the edge in their behavior when they\u2019re in Vegas,\u201d she said.

          "title": "Frigid weather sends heating prices soaring as energy usage spikes",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A severe winter storm in the U.S. Northeast brought plunging temperatures on Friday, driving regional natural gas prices to all-time highs, disrupting refinery operations and causing electrical outages.  From Baltimore to Caribou, Maine, efforts were under way to clear roadways from Thursday\u2019s snowfall. Temperatures were expected to be 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit below the average for this time of year and could set records, according to the National Weather Service.  Power outages fell to 123,000 from the 235,000 knocked out by the storm over the past couple of days and were largely concentrated in Canada, with 85,100 in Nova Scotia, 16,600 in New Brunswick and 5,100 in Quebec.  Refiners in the Philadelphia region were battling severe cold that has slowed crude deliveries and forced the largest plant on the U.S. Coast to significantly cut production.  Natural gas prices in the U.S. Northeast were at an all-time record on the back of heating demand. Benchmark U.S. heating oil futures HOc1 were near their highest in almost three years.   Estimated U.S. natural gas demand soared on Monday, surpassing the previous single-day record set in 2014, according to estimates from Reuters. The increase came on the back of the low temperatures, higher consumption in the electric power and industrial sectors, and greater export demand.    U.S. demand for natural gas, which is the major heating fuel in the Northeast and is also widely used by power plants, was expected to remain near record highs this week.   Next-day gas prices in New York City NG-CG-NY-SNL jumped to a record $140.25 per million British thermal units, according to data from brokerage firm SNL going back to 1992. The prior high was $120.75 set during the polar vortex in January 2014.  Spot gas in New England soared to a record $82.75 per mmBtu, according to data going back to 1995. The prior high was $77.60, also in January 2014.  In 2017, next-day gas prices averaged $3.08 per mmBtu in New York and $3.80 in New England.  The only nuclear plant in Massachusetts remained shut on Friday after halting operations on Thursday afternoon due to the failure of a line that connects the reactor to the power grid.  Entergy Corp (ETR.N), which operates the Pilgrim Station, said it had not identified the cause of the line problem. ISO New England, which operates the region\u2019s power grid, attributed the shutdown to blizzard conditions.   The New England grid operator said it expected the region to have sufficient generating resources to meet the peak demand of 20,450 megawatts and reserve requirements of 2,128 MW on Friday but would only have a surplus of about 500 MW if it must use all of its reserves. Pilgrim\u2019s capacity is about 688 MW.    The average U.S. home heating oil price rose 5.4 percent to $3.078 a gallon in the seven days through Jan. 1 from a week earlier, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. On the East Coast, the price increased 5.4 percent to $3.085.    Prices for the 2017-18 period are well above the 2016-17 levels, the data showed.   Next-day power prices in New England E-NEPLMHP-IDX and PJM E-PJWHRTP-IX, which covers much of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Midwest region, rose to their highest since January 2014 due to a spike for local natural gas.  There are concerns that a significant disruption could lead to a heating oil shortage as distillate inventories in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions are at their lowest levels for this time of year since 2015.  Supply worries have spurred tankers carrying diesel and heating oil to set out from Europe for the United States, reversing a traditional trade route.  Icebreakers have been used in ports of Boston, New York and Philadelphia to keep shipping lanes clear, but delays are expected, and the Coast Guard said late on Wednesday that those ships would remain at shore until the storm had passed.      Reliance on heating oil is highest in the Northeast, with about 21 percent of households using it for space heating.   Most northern U.S. refiners are not reporting significant problems, but the extreme cold still poses threats.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions has cut rates by 40 percent at its 335,000 bpd refinery complex in Philadelphia due to a winter storm slowing crude deliveries, a source familiar with the plant\u2019s operations told Reuters on Friday. It\u2019s the largest refinery on the U.S. East Coast.   The company also postponed planned work at its 335,000 barrel-per-day refinery complex in Philadelphia until after the storm.   Ridgebury Pioneer, which was carrying 1.9 million barrels of heavy crude into PBF Energy\u2019s (PBF.N) East Coast refineries, has been delayed by the storm, according to Reuters Eikon shipping data and two sources familiar with the delivery.  VLCCs, or Very Large Crude Carriers, are uncommon in the Philadelphia region. Monroe Energy was forced to shut its plant in September when a hurricane slowed deliveries.

          "title": "Author of Trump book contradicts president, says aides see him as a 'child'",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The author of a deeply critical book about Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office said on Friday he had spoken with the president while working on it, contradicting Trump\u2019s assertion that he had never talked to the writer for the book and had not authorized any access to the White House.  Michael Wolff\u2019s book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d was an instant bestseller on Friday, its release pulled forward after published excerpts this week set off a political firestorm, threats by Trump lawyers of legal action and an effort to halt publication.  The book, dismissed by Trump as full of lies, depicts a chaotic White House, a president who was ill-prepared to win the office in 2016, and Trump aides who scorned his abilities.  Standing by his reporting, Wolff told NBC on Friday that Trump aides had all told him they viewed him as child-like.   \u201cI absolutely spoke to the president. Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don\u2019t know, but it was certainly not off the record,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program. Wolff added that he had spoken to people who spoke to Trump on a daily, \u201csometimes minute by minute\u201d basis.  Asked to clarify what he meant when he wrote that Trump\u2019s entire circle questioned his fitness for office, Wolff said, \u201c100 percent of the people around him ... They all say he is like a child.\u201d  On Thursday evening, Trump tweeted, \u201cI authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book.\u201d  \u201cFull of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don\u2019t exist,\u201d Trump added.  The early excerpts have also caused a public rift between the president and his former chief strategist and top campaign aide, Steve Bannon, over Bannon\u2019s comments in the book about Trump and his family.  BEST-SELLER ON DAY ONE  Lawyers for Trump had called on the book\u2019s publisher, Henry Holt & Co, to halt the book\u2019s release, originally scheduled for Tuesday. Instead, it began sales early and on Friday, its first day in stores, \u201cFire and Fury\u201d was the top-selling book on Amazon.com.  In Washington, customers lined up in bitterly cold weather to purchase a copy at KramerBooks, which began selling copies at midnight. Many Washington-area bookstores, including KramerBooks, reported selling out of copies as of Friday morning at 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT).   Justin Bethel, manager of the Politics and Prose bookstore, said its 30 copies sold out quickly. \u201cIt got so we couldn\u2019t answer the phone, it was ringing so much,\u201d he said.  Politics and Prose customer Daniel Zhang, 22, said he and his housemate read a chapter online on Thursday night and he planned to read the book later on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m going to finish work, and then I\u2019m not going out tonight; I\u2019m just going to go back and read this book,\u201d said Zhang.  The reaction was less frenetic in New York, Trump\u2019s old home base. Book Culture, an independent book seller in the Upper West Side neighborhood, said on Friday morning four people had bought the book and it had about 160 copies available, with 150 copies available in its other store.  The White House has said the book is riddled with errors, and campaign and administration officials have disputed events depicted in the book.   Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, who has called the book trash, said again on Friday that Wolff had talked only briefly to the president and did not have wide access.   \u201cThis is a guy who made up a lot of stories to try to sell books,\u201d Sanders said in an interview on Fox News Channel.  In a tweet on Friday, Trump called the book another attempt to smear him since any collusion between his election campaign and Russia \u201cis proving to be a total hoax.\u201d   Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating possible collusion as part of a broader probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He has not announced any conclusions.  \u201cThe Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable,\u201d Trump wrote.   Charles Harder, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, in a legal notice provided to Reuters, warned on Thursday of possible claims including libel against Wolff and Henry Holt & Co and threatened to try to block publication of the book. Harder also told Reuters that \u201clegal action is imminent\u201d against Bannon.  Bannon\u2019s reaction to the controversy has been muted. In interviews after the news broke with the conservative Breitbart News website, he called Trump a \u201cgreat man\u201d and pledged continued support for the president\u2019s agenda.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, the conservative former attorney general of Oklahoma, is interested in replacing Attorney General Jeff Sessions if that job becomes available, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.  President Donald Trump has openly criticized Sessions for months, provoking speculation that the attorney general might resign or be fired. The EPA chief would likely accept the position if it were offered by Trump, a source close to Pruitt told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Jahan Wilcox, an EPA spokesman, in an email denied that Pruitt was interested in serving as attorney general.  \u201cThis is not true,\u201d Wilcox said.  \u201cAdministrator Pruitt is solely focused on implementing President Trump\u2019s agenda to protect the environment,\u201d Wilcox added.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  As EPA chief, Pruitt has worked to overturn a number of environmental policies put in place under Republican Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama and was instrumental in the U.S. decision to walk away from the 2015 Paris global climate change accord.  Pruitt was the runner-up to Sessions for the attorney general post when Trump was first assembling his Cabinet, according to the source.  Another source said Pruitt felt that serving as attorney general \u2014 the top U.S. law enforcement post \u2014 would be a better fit for him than his current job or running either for governor or senator in his home state.  News organization Politico first reported Pruitt\u2019s interest in the attorney general job.  Trump has been at odds with Sessions since the attorney general recused himself in March from the federal investigation into potential collusion between the Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia in the 2016 U.S. election. Pressure on Sessions has been rising, and some conservative Republican lawmakers have called on him to resign.  The White House said Pruitt will attend a weekend meeting at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with Trump, other Cabinet members and Republican congressional leaders to lay out legislative priorities for the year and discuss a strategy for the November congressional elections.  Sessions will not attend, his office said.  Pruitt served as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general prior to taking the EPA job, suing the EPA 14 times, each time taking the side of industry. As EPA chief, he has spearheaded an aggressive de-regulatory agenda that has begun to unwind Obama administration policies on climate change, air pollution and water pollution.  Environmental activists expressed alarm over the potential of Pruitt as attorney general.  \u201cIf Scott Pruitt becomes attorney general, he\u2019d go from tearing down public health protections at EPA at the behest of polluters, to looking the other way at the Justice Department when they break the law,\u201d Environmental Working Group President Ken Cook said.

          "title": "Businesses cautious in installing patches to fix chip flaw",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Chances that a fix to a major microchip security flaw may slow down or crash some computer systems are leading some businesses to hold off installing software patches, fearing the cure may be worse than the original problem.  Researchers this week revealed security problems with chips from Intel Corp (INTC.O) and many of its rivals, sending businesses, governments and consumers scrambling to understand the extent of the threat and the cost of fixes.   Rather than rushing to put on patches, a costly and time-intensive endeavor for major systems, some businesses are testing the fix, leaving their machines vulnerable.  \u201cIf you start applying patches across your whole fleet without doing proper testing, you could cause systems to crash, essentially putting all of your employees out of work,\u201d said Ben Johnson, co-founder of cyber-security startup Obsidian.  Banks and other financial institutions spent much of the week studying the vulnerabilities, said Greg Temm, chief information risk officer with the Financial Services Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an industry group that shares data on emerging cyber threats.  The flaws affect virtually all computers and mobile devices, but are not considered \u201ccritical\u201d because there is no evidence that hackers have figured out how to exploit them, said Temm, whose group works with many of the world\u2019s largest banks.  \u201cIt\u2019s like getting a diagnosis of high blood pressure, but not having a cardiac arrest,\u201d Temm said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it seriously, but it\u2019s not something that is killing us.\u201d   Banks are testing the patches to see if they slow operations and, if so, what changes need to be made, Temm said. For instance, computers could be added to networks to make up for the lack of processor speed in individual machines, he added.  Some popular antivirus software programs are incompatible with the software updates, causing desktop and laptop computers to freeze up and show a \u201cblue screen of death,\u201d researcher Johnson said.  Antivirus software makers responded by rolling out fixes to make their products compatible with the updated operating systems, he said. In a blog posting on Friday, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said it would only offer security patches to Windows customers whose antivirus software suppliers had confirmed with Microsoft that the patch would not crash the customer\u2019s machine.  \u201cIf you have not been offered the security update, you may be running incompatible antivirus software, and you should consult the software vendor,\u201d Microsoft advised in the blog post.  Government agencies also are watching. The Ohio Attorney General\u2019s office is monitoring the situation, a spokesman said by email.  \u201cIntel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time,\u201d the world\u2019s No. 1 chipmaker said on Thursday in a release.  It cited Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft as saying that most users had seen no significant impact on performance after installing the patches.  The cloud vendors are among a group of firms that quickly patched their technology to mitigate against the threat from one of those vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown, which only affects machines running Intel chips.  Major software makers have not issued patches to protect against the second vulnerability, dubbed Spectre, which affects nearly all computer chips made in the last decade, including those from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), and ARM-architecture manufacturers, including Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).  However, Google, Firefox and Microsoft have implemented measures in most web browsers to stop hackers from launching remote attacks using Spectre.  Governments and security experts say they have seen no cyber attacks seeking to exploit either vulnerability, though they expect attempts by hackers as they digest technical data about the security flaws.  One key risk is that hackers will develop code that can infect the personal computers of people visiting malicious websites, said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer of cyber security firm Veracode.  He advised PC owners to install the patches to protect against such potential attacks. Computer servers at large enterprises are less at risk, he said, because those systems are not used to surf the web and can only be infected in a Meltdown attack if a hacker has already breached that network.   Microsoft has issued a patch for its Windows operating system, and Apple desktop users with the most recent operating system are protected. Google has said most of its Chromebook laptops are already protected and that the rest would be soon.  Apple said it planned to release a patch to its Safari web browser within coming days to protect Mac and iOS users from Spectre.   While third-party browsers from Google and others can protect Mac users from Spectre, all major web browsers for Apple\u2019s iOS devices depend on receiving a patch from Apple. Until then, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users will be exposed to potential Spectre attacks while browsing the Web.  Editing by Richard Chang"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump proposed new subsidies for coal and nuclear plants, it seemed like an obvious way to deliver on campaign promises to boost the nation\u2019s energy industry.  And yet the plan, announced in September, set off sharp criticism from other sectors that Trump has also vowed to help, such as natural gas and utilities.  \u201cSubsidies don\u2019t make you competitive - and don\u2019t make you great again,\u201d said Robert Flexon, the president and chief executive of Dynegy Inc DYN.N, a Houston-based utility that owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants.  Squabbling over the proposal exemplifies the administration\u2019s larger struggle to deliver on promises of a sweeping \u201cenergy renaissance\u201d across the coal, oil, gas and nuclear industries.  Trouble is, policies that help one of those sectors often hurt another, illustrating the complexity of energy regulation and the difficulty in appeasing competing interests. While election campaigns often seek to neatly divide voters into two camps - those supporting energy vs. those supporting the environment - such rhetoric fails to capture the messier policy impacts on profits, hiring and emissions reductions across the energy landscape.  There is little evidence that Trump\u2019s moves so far have aided energy firms of any stripe; some administration proposals have languished amid divisive politics, while other regulatory changes have seen their impact muted by market forces.  Utilities, for instance, have shown little interest in buying more coal-fired power despite the regulatory rollbacks in Trump\u2019s pro-coal push.  A broader measure of investor sentiment on the energy industry - the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 energy index - lost more than 7 percent in 2017 even as stock markets soared.  White House and Energy Department officials did not respond to requests for comment.  Another political flashpoint has been the administration\u2019s waffling over proposed changes to biofuels policy.  Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency initially entertained a plan from oil refiners to upend regulations requiring them to blend ethanol into their gasoline - then rejected it after a backlash from the ethanol industry, rooted in Midwest corn-growing states that supported Trump\u2019s election.  The dispute sparked open warfare among the congressional backers of various industry interests, including threats to block Trump\u2019s agency nominations and accusations he had welched on campaign promises.  Even the coal industry, which played a starring role in Trump\u2019s campaign, has seen a marginal return on its lobbying efforts. It has, for instance, had little success so far in attacking subsidies for wind and solar power.  Trump and others in his administration have criticized renewable energy as expensive and dependent on government support. But the White House has not sought to repeal tax breaks expected to provide $12.3 billion to renewable energy firms by 2020, which other Republicans continue to support.   Fossil-fuel firms clearly have more influence on policy under Trump and easier access to decision makers. Coal, oil, and gas company executives have met regularly with senior administration officials, according to official agency schedules.   Their policy victories include rollbacks of regulations limiting emissions of carbon, methane and other pollutants; the opening of Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling; and the lifting of a coal-mining moratorium on federal lands.  But the impact of these moves on production, profits and jobs remains uncertain. Demand for additional drilling and mining leases on federal lands has been thin, and top U.S. oil and gas companies have told shareholders in regulatory filings that environmental regulations have little impact on their business.  While coal advocates have generally cheered Trump\u2019s ascension, White House policies have so far had little effect on U.S. coal consumption.   Robert Murray, chief executive of private coal company Murray Energy Corp., said Republican efforts to boost coal have addressed only the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d of overturning a few environmental regulations while avoiding tougher issues.  The oil and gas industry, also championed by Trump, similarly feels let down by an administration it had hoped would strip away government interference, said Susan Ginsburg, a senior vice president of regulatory affairs for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents small oil and gas companies.   The industry, she said, expected that \u201cmarkets would be allowed to work.\u201d   For the coal industry - which has seen a decade of decline amid competition from cheap natural gas - the wish-list for the Trump administration is long.  In the months after Trump was elected, Trump and senior cabinet members including Energy Secretary Rick Perry met with mining executives such as Murray. Other administration officials met with lobbyists for coal firms including Peabody Energy Corp, the nation\u2019s largest miner.  Murray handed the White House a long list of recommendations, including rescinding pollution controls, slashing the EPA\u2019s size and ending green energy incentives.  Emails obtained by the Sierra Club in October revealed that Peabody had also given the administration a list of proposals, including a controversial electricity pricing measure based on the argument that coal and nuclear plants improve grid reliability.  Perry proposed in September that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reward coal and nuclear plants that have 90 days of fuel supply in reserve by covering their operating costs through power pricing changes. FERC is expected to decide on the request by Jan. 10.   That proposal irritated oil and gas producers, along with renewable energy firms. Both were caught off guard, said a Washington-based oil-and-gas lobbyist who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern over offending the administration.  \u201cNobody in the oil and gas industry, or in the renewables industry for that matter, was consulted,\u201d the lobbyist said. \u201cIt just came out of nowhere.\u201d  The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major U.S. oil and gas companies, wrote that the plan \u201cupsets the very foundations of the competitive wholesale electricity markets.\u201d  Michael Steel, a spokesman for the Affordable Energy Coalition, which has oil major BP (BP.L) as a member, called the proposal an unfair subsidy.  \u201cThe Department of Energy is trying to pick winners and losers in a way that will raise costs for consumers by billions of dollars,\u201d Steel said.  The political dustup over biofuels policy provides another telling example of the difficulty appeasing competing industry camps.  The Renewable Fuel Standard was introduced under former President George W. Bush as a way to help farmers and reduce oil imports. But refining companies say it costs them a fortune and threatens their survival.  Refiners expected changes to the policy after Trump named billionaire investor and refinery owner Carl Icahn as an unofficial adviser on regulation. Icahn and others proposed shifting the blending requirement to other businesses and reducing biofuels blending quotas.  But the proposals drew heavy fire from the ethanol industry and its backers. Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa in October threatened to block a key EPA nomination until the administration rejected the proposals - which it did days later, at Trump\u2019s direction.   The refining industry, in turn, was outraged by the reversal. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and other lawmakers from states with refineries demanded a meeting with Trump. Cruz later said he would block a nomination to the Department of Agriculture over the issue.   The White House is now mediating talks between both sides.  EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman, asked if the agency could have handled the situation differently, said: \u201cIt is good public policy to vet our options with all stakeholders, which is what we have \u2013 and will continue \u2013 to do.\u201d  Follow Trump\u2019s impact on energy and environment at The Trump Effect\u00a0www.reuters.com/trump-effect.

          "title": "California bill uses donations to avoid Trump tax changes",
          "body": "(Reuters) - A new proposal in California would allow residents to make donations instead of paying taxes in order to avoid the new federal tax plan\u2019s cap on deductions of state taxes.  The California legislation, introduced on Thursday by Democratic Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, would allow residents to donate to a new state public-purpose \u201cexcellence fund\u201d and receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit in return. De Leon says taxpayers would then be able to deduct the donation from their federal taxes, essentially undermining that part of the law signed by President Donald Trump.  The proposal is one a few ideas under consideration by high-tax states that will most acutely feel the sting of the new federal cap on state and local tax deductions.   Democratic governors in New York and Connecticut have raised the possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the cap. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was developing a plan to restructure the state\u2019s payroll tax system.  California and other states with high income and property taxes are scrambling to deal with the $10,000 federal deduction cap imposed by the sweeping tax overhaul bill passed by congressional Republicans and signed into law last month by President Donald Trump.  \u201cThe Republican tax plan gives corporations and hedge-fund managers a trillion-dollar tax cut and expects California taxpayers to foot the bill,\u201d de Le\u00f3n said in a statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow California residents to be the casualty of this disastrous tax scheme.\u201d  About 6 million California taxpayers, a third of the total, itemized deductions on their tax returns, claiming an average of $18,438 for state and local taxes, according to a fact sheet on the legislation.  The excellence fund would be created by the proposed legislation and exist within the state\u2019s general fund, according to de Leon\u2019s office. The bill did not provide details on how money in the fund would be used.  Because states are not registered as charities, their tax codes would have to be modified for them to be considered charitable organizations, said Joseph Callahan, a lawyer with Mackay, Caswell & Callahan in New York.  \u201cI\u2019m scratching my head at how that would work,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom (a U.S. Internal Revenue Service) perspective, it is against public policy; it is against the intention of the Congress.\u201d   An IRS spokesman on Friday declined to comment on the California bill.  The bill\u2019s fact sheet said California and other states had created tax credit programs to fund access to college and private education.  White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said the federal government might try to block attempts to circumvent the cap, Bloomberg reported on Friday.  The California proposal is modeled after an existing tax credit offered for contributions to the CalGrant program that provides college scholarships. Seventeen other states use similar models to fund private education.  Reporting by Karen Pierog and Stephanie Kelly; Additional reporting by Robin Respaut; Editing by Daniel Bases and Jonahan Oatis"

          "body": "(Reuters) - The home of an Alabama woman who accused Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexually assaulting her has been destroyed by a fire, but the local sheriff said on Friday the blaze does not appear to be linked to the case.  \u201cThe ongoing investigation does not lead us to believe that the fire is in any way related to Roy Moore or allegations made against him,\u201d the Etowah County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement.  It added the office is speaking to a person of interest in the blaze that took place on Wednesday and arrest warrants have not yet been obtained.  The home in Gadsden belonged to Tina Johnson, who told AL.com, an Alabama news site, that Moore had groped her while she was in his Alabama law office on legal business in 1991.  Johnson, who was 28 at the time, said she visited Moore\u2019s office with her mother, who had hired Moore in a custody case involving Johnson\u2019s 12-year-old son.  Reuters was unable to independently verify the allegations, and Moore has denied any wrongdoing.  Five other women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct or of dating them when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers.  Johnson was not immediately available for comment on the fire. She was quoted by Al.com on Friday as saying that she and her husband were at work at the time of the blaze and they lost everything they owned.  \u201cI am devastated, just devastated,\u201d she was quoted as saying.  Moore, the conservative Christian Republican whose campaign was tainted by accusations that he pursued teenaged girls while in his 30s, was defeated in Alabama\u2019s special election for the U.S. Senate last month.   Doug Jones became the first Democrat sent to the Senate from Republican stronghold Alabama in a quarter century.  Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Sandra Maler"

          "body": "ANKARA (Reuters) - A United Nations Security Council meeting that centered on anti-government protests in Iran was another foreign policy blunder of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, Iran\u2019s foreign minister wrote on his Twitter account.  \u201cThe UNSC rebuffed the US\u2019 naked attempt to hijack its mandate ... Another FP (foreign policy) blunder for the Trump administration,\u201d Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted.  Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshroo told a U.N. Security Council meeting on Friday that the United States had abused its power as a permanent member of the Council by calling for a meeting on the turmoil in Iran, in which at least 22 people have been killed and over 1,000 arrested.  Khoshroo, echoing Iran\u2019s official stance, said his government had \u201chard evidence\u201d that recent protests in Iran were \u201cvery clearly directed from abroad\u201d.  U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said at the meeting that the United States stood \u201cunapologetically with those in Iran who seek freedom for themselves, prosperity for their families, and dignity for their nation\u201d.  \u201cWe will not be quiet. No dishonest attempt to call protesters \u2018puppets of foreign powers\u2019 will change that. The Iranian people know the truth. And we know the truth,\u201d she said.  \u201cThey are acting of their own will, on their own behalf, for their own future. Nothing will stop Americans from standing in solidarity with them. In 2009, the world stood by passively while the hopes of the Iranian people were crushed by their government. In 2018, we will not be silent,\u201d Haley added.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Following a tumultuous start to 2018, President Donald Trump and top Republicans began a two-day retreat in Maryland on Friday to lay out legislative priorities for the year and discuss strategy for pivotal November congressional elections.  Trump and party leaders, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, face a Jan. 19 deadline on passing legislation to prevent a government shutdown. They also were due to discuss broader issues to highlight ahead of midterm elections in which Republicans will battle to keep control of Congress.  \u201cWe have a lot of things to work on, a lot of things to accomplish,\u201d Trump told reporters as he left for the talks being held at the Camp David presidential retreat.  The meeting comes on the heels of explosive comments by Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, contained in a new book that put the White House on the defensive.  Trump is seeking more legislative wins after cementing the first major victory of his presidency in December with a tax overhaul long sought by his party and its supporters.  The White House has said its next top priorities are a plan to invest in roads, bridges and other infrastructure, and an overhaul of welfare programs. Also on the agenda is immigration policy including addressing protections for hundreds of thousands of young adults who were brought to the United States illegally as children.  While Trump and McConnell want to work on infrastructure first, Ryan is more interested in tackling so-called entitlement programs such as welfare. A White House official said the timing of legislation would be discussed, as well as the November election.  All 435 members of the House and a third of the 100 members of the Senate will be up for re-election. A Democratic takeover of one or both chambers could stifle Trump\u2019s agenda.  The Camp David strategy session will provide an opportunity to switch subjects after the furor over the book, which went on sale on Friday, that describes an inept Trump White House.

Cabinet members including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt will also attend, along with a handful of senior White House advisers.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) will record a $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the U.S. tax reform law passed last month, the drugmaker said in a regulatory filing on Friday.  The expense is primarily related to taxes on unremitted offshore earnings, the company said.  Bristol said the charge will affect its previous forecast for net earnings per share and its tax rate, but will not have an impact on its outlook after adjusting for one-time items.  In October, the company said it expected full-year 2017 net earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.46 with an effective tax rate of 25 percent to 26 percent, while adjusted earnings were forecast at $2.95 to $3.05 per share with a tax rate of 22 percent.  Changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act include a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. It also exempts U.S. corporations from U.S. taxes on most future foreign profits, sets a one-time tax for U.S. business profits now held overseas, and prevents companies from shifting profits out of the United States to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad.   Bristol-Myers said it is still evaluating all the provisions of the legislation and currently estimates that the net impact on its adjusted tax rate will be roughly neutral in 2018.   The drugmaker plans an update when it provides a full-year outlook on Feb. 5.  Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Tom Brown"

(Reuters) - Opponents of TransCanada Corp\u2019s proposed Keystone XL pipeline appealed a decision by Nebraska regulators to approve a path for the project through the state, a lawyer for the opponents said on Friday.  The legal challenge throws up another obstacle to the long-delayed project, which environmentalists have made a symbol of their fight against climate change but which President Donald Trump supports as a job creator.  The Nebraska Public Service Commission in November approved a route for Keystone XL, lifting what appeared to be the last big regulatory hurdle for the 1,179-mile (1,897-km) pipeline linking the oil fields of Canada\u2019s Alberta province to U.S. refineries, initially proposed nearly a decade ago.   But the approval was not for TransCanada\u2019s preferred path, and was instead for an alternative route that shifted it eastward to an existing pipeline right-of-way.   Lawyers for opponents of the pipeline - which include landowners along the route - have argued that the commission was not permitted to approve anything but the original route TransCanada had requested in its application.  Attorney David Domina told Reuters on Friday that TransCanada\u2019s approval was for a \u201croute not supported by an application. ... So we appealed.\u201d The appeal was filed on Dec. 29.  A TransCanada official declined to comment.  The proposed pipeline has been a lightning rod of controversy for nearly a decade, pitting environmentalists worried about spills and global warming against business advocates who say the project will lower fuel prices, shore up national security and bring jobs.  The Trump administration granted TransCanada a federal permit for the pipeline in March, reversing a decision by former President Barack Obama to reject the project on environmental grounds. That left Nebraska - the only one of three states that had not approved a route for the line - as the final hurdle.  TransCanada has said it expects enough commercial support to make the project viable, though it has not made a final investment decision.  Writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Leslie Adler"

          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Exchange-operator CME Group Inc will allow a type of privately negotiated transaction in all its agricultural markets for the first time on Monday, splitting traders who predict the move will either improve or hurt transparency.  The company, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will expand the use of  transactions called block trades in its grain and livestock futures and options, such as corn. It already permits the trades in other markets ranging from Black Sea wheat to Eurodollars.  Block trades are large, privately negotiated deals struck away from the broader market by phone or otherwise and cleared by the exchange. They must exceed exchange-set size limits and be reported publicly after completion.      The transactions help traders execute large-lot orders at a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d single price and avoid disrupting prices in markets with lower liquidity, such as deferred-contract months, according to CME Group.  The company has lost liquidity in deferred futures spreads as the rise of computerized algorithmic trading has driven activity to front-month contracts, said Gary Sandlund, president of brokerage Futures International.  \u201cThe exchange is doing a very good thing here in attempting to try to bring that back into the exchange and create a bit more transparency on some of these back-end spreads,\u201d he said.  Block trading is the latest evolution of the agricultural markets, which trace their origins to grain merchants who formed the CBOT in 1848. The closure of open-outcry futures pits, in which traders shouted out orders to buy and sell, marked the end of an era in 2015, after most transactions went online.  CME Group talked with agricultural traders to gauge support for block trades, the company said in a letter to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The transactions should account for a small percentage of overall trading and not reduce liquidity, it said.  Cargill Inc [CARG.UL], a major U.S. grain trader, told Reuters it will evaluate block trades for its business.  \u201cWe are encouraged that the exchange continues to look for ways the commercial trade can manage price risk exposures further out the curve,\u201d spokeswoman Antonella Bellman said.  However, the National Grain and Feed Association, a trade group, told CME Group and the CFTC in letters that the change threatens transparency by removing business from the public marketplace.   \u201cIt is our opinion that when large trades in deferred months are negotiated between parties \u2018off exchange\u2019 that price discovery is very likely compromised,\u201d the association said.

Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said the White House on Friday had submitted a list of demands it wanted in order to agree a deal that were simply a repeat of a document it sent to Congress in early October. Democratic leaders rejected those demands at the time.  Further inflaming the negotiations, Durbin said, was an added White House demand for $18 billion to fund the construction of a wall along the southwestern border with Mexico, despite staunch Democratic opposition.   On Saturday, congressional Republican leaders are due to huddle with Trump at Camp David, the presidential mountain retreat, to discuss 2018 legislative priorities.  Republican and Democratic leaders are also scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House on Tuesday to talk about immigration legislation.  Durbin said the latest White House move, coming as Congress also struggles to pass a bill by Jan. 19 to fund the government through September, could push federal agencies closer to a shutdown.  Earlier, some congressional Republicans downplayed the likelihood of a deal with Democrats on legislation to protect the Dreamers - some 700,000 young immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.  Republican Senator John Cornyn accused Democrats in a tweet of trying to force a deal on Dreamers by doing a \u201cslow walk\u201d on efforts to approve critical disaster aid and defense spending.  Two other Republicans late on Thursday said the sides remained far apart. \u201cOur discussions on border security and enforcement with Democrats are much further apart, and that is key to getting a bipartisan deal on DACA,\u201d senators Thom Tillis and James Lankford said in a statement.  On Oct. 8, the White House released a list of immigration \u201cprinciples\u201d Trump wanted in return for giving Dreamers legislative protection from deportation.  Besides the border wall, it included the hiring of 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and 300 federal prosecutors.  Immigration advocacy groups fear the hiring expansion would be part of an attempt to round up the adult relatives of Dreamers to ship them to their native countries.   Resubmitting the demands that were dismissed by Democrats three months ago, Durbin said, was \u201coutrageous.\u201d But he added that bipartisan negotiations continue among senators.  Democrats have said they are open to tying DACA to additional funding for border security technology. But they oppose Trump\u2019s wall, which government estimates have said could cost over $21 billion.      Republican lawmakers met with Trump at the White House on Thursday and initially emerged saying they were optimistic that they could find a legislative fix for DACA.  The struggle over the Dreamers carries political weight for both parties heading into the November 2018 midterm congressional elections. Most of the Dreamers came from Mexico and Hispanics tend to vote for Democrats.  Cornyn, in an interview on Fox News on Friday, said Trump would demand that an immigration deal address the visa lottery system and chain migration that unites family members.   \u201cThose are things that he\u2019s insisted upon,\u201d and Democrats would have to embrace them along with border security, said Cornyn.

          "body": "LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - Virgil van Dijk made a dream start to his Anfield career, scoring the winning goal on his debut for Liverpool, as they beat city rivals Everton 2-1 in a pulsating FA Cup third round tie on Friday.  The Dutchman, signed last week from Southampton for a reported fee of 75 million pounds ($101.7 million), rose inside the area to head home an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain corner in front of the Kop end in the 84th minute of what had been an enthralling Merseyside derby.  \u201cWhat a night. It was thoroughly deserved, it felt amazing to be out there, the goal is very special for me and my family,\u201d said Van Dijk.  \u201cPlaying at Anfield for Liverpool is a dream for every player. To score a goal is even more special.\u201d  Liverpool looked to have been frustrated after Gylfi Sigurdsson brought Everton level in the 67th minute after a brilliant counter-attack from Sam Allardyce\u2019s side.  That looked to have produced a repeat of the Premier League clash between the pair in December when Everton grabbed a 1-1 draw despite their rivals having had many more chances.  But Van Dijk, bought to shore up Liverpool\u2019s weakest link, the center of their defense, proved his value at the other end of the field with his strength and aerial power delivering the killer blow.  After a frenetic start, Liverpool had taken the lead through a 35th minute penalty from James Milner after Everton defender Mason Holgate had pulled down Adam Lallana in the box.  It was in many ways an old-school derby with plenty of strong challenges, a high-tempo and end-to-end rhythm but it was Juergen Klopp\u2019s side who created the greater openings.  Everton\u2019s Wayne Rooney, who had been booked in just the seventh minute for a late lunge on Joe Gomez, was substituted in the 52nd minute, probably to save him from the risk of a red-card as he looked close to loosing his cool.  Gomez headed wide at the back post when he had been left unmarked at a 54th minute corner and a minute later Lallana poked the ball wide after being sent clear through on goal.  Everton keeper Jordan Pickford produced a fine parry to keep out an Andy Robertson blast at the near post.  The Toffees looked to have made Klopp\u2019s men pay for failing to make the most of those chances with Sigurdsson\u2019s cool side foot finish.  But the world\u2019s most expensive defender had other ideas.  ($1 = 0.7373 pounds)  Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Christian Radnedge"

          "body": "MANCHESTER (Reuters) - Late goals by in-form Jesse Lingard and fit-again striker Romelu Lukaku helped Manchester United to reach the FA Cup fourth round as they ground out a 2-0 home win over Championship (second-tier) side Derby County on Friday.  The visitors looked likely to force a replay before Lingard struck with a first-time shot in the 84th minute for his fourth goal in as many games after a fine brace in a 2-2 Premier League draw with Burnley and another in a 2-0 win over Everton.  Lukaku, who returned from a head injury and came on as a halftime substitute for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, broke away and powered his shot past goalkeeper Scott Carson at the death as Derby threw men forward in search of an equalizer.  The outcome pleased United manager Jose Mourinho, who praised Lingard and Carson after he produced a barrage of superb saves.  \u201cIt was a great shot by Jesse Lingard in the top corner, he\u2019s in a moment of confidence where things go well for him,\u201d Mourinho told the BBC.  \u201cHe\u2019s a good professional and a fantastic kid in the dressing room.  \u201cI was feeling that we were close to scoring and we never stopped trying. But when you get past 80 minutes and the goal hasn\u2019t come, you fear the second match. But the team kept trying so I knew the goal could arrive.\u201d  United had missed a string of chances as Lingard hit the post with a fierce arrowed shot several minutes before he broke the deadlock and Marcus Rashford also found the woodwork with a glancing header in the opening half.  Carson kept out an array of stinging long range efforts, including three from Paul Pogba as United struggled to find a way through a resolute and well-organized visiting defense.  Pinned back for much of the contest, Derby launched several dangerous raids as defender Marcus Olsson and midfielder Tom Lawrence came close for the Rams, who finally cracked in the closing stages.  Carson was left clutching thin air as Lingard unleashed a swiveling shot into the top left corner from 18 meters and with Derby throwing caution to the wind, Lukaku raced clear to score his 16th goal for United in all competitions.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Newly appointed interim U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan has tapped Robert Khuzami, formerly director of enforcement for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to serve as his deputy, Berman\u2019s office announced Friday.  Berman and Khuzami worked together as assistant U.S. attorneys in Manhattan in the early 1990s. Khuzami worked at the prosecutor\u2019s office until 2002, rising to lead the office\u2019s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force.   Khuzami went on to work for Deutsche Bank AG from 2002 until early 2009, when he left and moved to the SEC.  At the time, the regulatory agency was under fire for failing to detect Bernard Madoff\u2019s $65 billion Ponzi scheme and was being accused of lax oversight leading up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  Under Khuzami\u2019s leadership, the SEC brought 735 enforcement actions in fiscal year 2011 and 734 actions in fiscal year 2012, more than in any prior years. At the same time, Khuzami faced criticism for not bringing enough actions against high-level Wall Street executives.  Khuzami left the SEC in January 2013 and later that year joined the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, where he has remained up to his appointment.  \u201cI am extremely pleased that Rob Khuzami will be returning to public service as deputy U.S. attorney,\u201d Berman said in a statement. \u201cRob was an outstanding (assistant U.S. attorney) during his prior tenure in the office, and he has since distinguished himself in further public service and in the private sector.\u201d  Khuzami could not immediately be reached for comment.  Berman, who served on Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, was one of 17 current and former federal prosecutors appointed by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions as interim U.S. attorneys in jurisdictions around the country on Wednesday.  The interim posts are for 120 days unless those holding them are re-appointed by a court or officially nominated by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, a Justice Department official said.  Berman was previously at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a supporter of Trump\u2019s presidential run in 2016, practices at the same firm.  Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said Thursday that she opposed Berman\u2019s nomination. In a statement to Reuters, she said that she found \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d reports the president personally interviewed Berman for the post of Manhattan U.S. attorney, whose jurisdiction includes Trump\u2019s home, offices and real estate holdings in New York.

          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Exchange-operator CME Group Inc will allow a type of privately negotiated transaction in all its agricultural markets for the first time on Monday, splitting traders who predict the move will either improve or hurt transparency.  The company, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will expand the use of  transactions called block trades in its grain and livestock futures and options, such as corn. It already permits the trades in other markets ranging from Black Sea wheat to Eurodollars.  Block trades are large, privately negotiated deals struck away from the broader market by phone or otherwise and cleared by the exchange. They must exceed exchange-set size limits and be reported publicly after completion.      The transactions help traders execute large-lot orders at a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d single price and avoid disrupting prices in markets with lower liquidity, such as deferred-contract months, according to CME Group.  The company has lost liquidity in deferred futures spreads as the rise of computerized algorithmic trading has driven activity to front-month contracts, said Gary Sandlund, president of brokerage Futures International.  \u201cThe exchange is doing a very good thing here in attempting to try to bring that back into the exchange and create a bit more transparency on some of these back-end spreads,\u201d he said.  Block trading is the latest evolution of the agricultural markets, which trace their origins to grain merchants who formed the CBOT in 1848. The closure of open-outcry futures pits, in which traders shouted out orders to buy and sell, marked the end of an era in 2015, after most transactions went online.  CME Group talked with agricultural traders to gauge support for block trades, the company said in a letter to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The transactions should account for a small percentage of overall trading and not reduce liquidity, it said.  Cargill Inc [CARG.UL], a major U.S. grain trader, told Reuters it will evaluate block trades for its business.  \u201cWe are encouraged that the exchange continues to look for ways the commercial trade can manage price risk exposures further out the curve,\u201d spokeswoman Antonella Bellman said.  However, the National Grain and Feed Association, a trade group, told CME Group and the CFTC in letters that the change threatens transparency by removing business from the public marketplace.   \u201cIt is our opinion that when large trades in deferred months are negotiated between parties \u2018off exchange\u2019 that price discovery is very likely compromised,\u201d the association said.

The expense is primarily related to taxes on unremitted offshore earnings, the company said.  Bristol said the charge will affect its previous forecast for net earnings per share and its tax rate, but will not have an impact on its outlook after adjusting for one-time items.  In October, the company said it expected full-year 2017 net earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.46 with an effective tax rate of 25 percent to 26 percent, while adjusted earnings were forecast at $2.95 to $3.05 per share with a tax rate of 22 percent.  Changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act include a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. It also exempts U.S. corporations from U.S. taxes on most future foreign profits, sets a one-time tax for U.S. business profits now held overseas, and prevents companies from shifting profits out of the United States to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad.   Bristol-Myers said it is still evaluating all the provisions of the legislation and currently estimates that the net impact on its adjusted tax rate will be roughly neutral in 2018.   The drugmaker plans an update when it provides a full-year outlook on Feb. 5.  Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Tom Brown"

          "body": "(Reuters) - A new proposal in California would allow residents to make donations instead of paying taxes in order to avoid the new federal tax plan\u2019s cap on deductions of state taxes.  The California legislation, introduced on Thursday by Democratic Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, would allow residents to donate to a new state public-purpose \u201cexcellence fund\u201d and receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit in return. De Leon says taxpayers would then be able to deduct the donation from their federal taxes, essentially undermining that part of the law signed by President Donald Trump.  The proposal is one a few ideas under consideration by high-tax states that will most acutely feel the sting of the new federal cap on state and local tax deductions.   Democratic governors in New York and Connecticut have raised the possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the cap. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was developing a plan to restructure the state\u2019s payroll tax system.  California and other states with high income and property taxes are scrambling to deal with the $10,000 federal deduction cap imposed by the sweeping tax overhaul bill passed by congressional Republicans and signed into law last month by President Donald Trump.  \u201cThe Republican tax plan gives corporations and hedge-fund managers a trillion-dollar tax cut and expects California taxpayers to foot the bill,\u201d de Le\u00f3n said in a statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow California residents to be the casualty of this disastrous tax scheme.\u201d  About 6 million California taxpayers, a third of the total, itemized deductions on their tax returns, claiming an average of $18,438 for state and local taxes, according to a fact sheet on the legislation.  The excellence fund would be created by the proposed legislation and exist within the state\u2019s general fund, according to de Leon\u2019s office. The bill did not provide details on how money in the fund would be used.  Because states are not registered as charities, their tax codes would have to be modified for them to be considered charitable organizations, said Joseph Callahan, a lawyer with Mackay, Caswell & Callahan in New York.  \u201cI\u2019m scratching my head at how that would work,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom (a U.S. Internal Revenue Service) perspective, it is against public policy; it is against the intention of the Congress.\u201d   An IRS spokesman on Friday declined to comment on the California bill.  The bill\u2019s fact sheet said California and other states had created tax credit programs to fund access to college and private education.  White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said the federal government might try to block attempts to circumvent the cap, Bloomberg reported on Friday.  The California proposal is modeled after an existing tax credit offered for contributions to the CalGrant program that provides college scholarships. Seventeen other states use similar models to fund private education.  Reporting by Karen Pierog and Stephanie Kelly; Additional reporting by Robin Respaut; Editing by Daniel Bases and Jonahan Oatis"

          "title": "Senate's Trump-Russia probe not close to ending: top Democrat",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Intelligence Committee probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election is nowhere near over, as lawmakers probe issues including a June 2016 meeting between top aides to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and a Russian lawyer, the panel\u2019s top Democrat indicated on Friday.  Senator Mark Warner said committee staff have interviewed everyone at the meeting, where President Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr. expected to be given derogatory information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, with the exception of \u201cone or two individuals who are Russian.\u201d  \u201cBut I feel very strongly that you can\u2019t, you could never conclude without the senators themselves being able to talk to the principals involved,\u201d Warner said. \u201cWe have not gotten there yet.\u201d  Warner, in an interview with Reuters, said the Senate investigation has made progress on several fronts.  It has, he said, \u201cre-validated\u201d a Jan. 6, 2017, U.S. intelligence assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign aimed at the 2016 presidential election, with the goal of undermining Americans\u2019 trust in their institutions and denigrating Clinton.  In an effort that has been \u201cfrustratingly slow,\u201d Warner said, the investigation also prompted the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to warn 21 U.S. states whose election systems were the subject of tampering attempts by Moscow.  \u201cDHS has upped its game. The state election officials have upped their game. And I think we are \u2013 not as fast as I\u2019d like \u2013 but I think electoral systems are going to be on better guard\u201d for congressional elections in November this year, Warner said.  Warner and fellow Democrats have worked closely with the Senate panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Senator Richard Burr. The bipartisanship contrasts with a parallel investigation by the House Intelligence Committee, where inter-party feuds have imperiled the effort, and may lead committee Republicans and Democrats to issue competing reports.  In the interview, Warner repeated a warning that he made in a Dec. 20 Senate floor speech that any move by Trump aimed at firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller would provoke a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d  Mueller is conducting a criminal probe of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, something the White House denies. Two Trump campaign associates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and aide George Papadopoulos, have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in Mueller\u2019s probe.  Warner said his concern that Trump might take a step to dismiss Mueller was confirmed by news reports on Thursday detailing steps the president reportedly took to blunt the Russia investigation.  Trump, the reports said, ordered White House counsel Donald McGahn to convince Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Justice Department\u2019s Russia probe, so Sessions could remain in charge of it. Sessions recused himself anyway.  \u201cIf true, it\u2019s one more example of this president\u2019s unusual behavior,\u201d the senator said.   \u201cAnd it\u2019s one of the reasons why I don\u2019t take as absolute the White House\u2019s assurances, \u2018oh no, we have no plans\u2019\u201d to fire Mueller. \u201cBecause clearly this is based upon the president\u2019s actions on a variety of topics \u2013 things can change on a dime.\u201d  Reporting by Mark Hosenball and Warren Strobel; additional reporting by Jonathan Landay; Editing by John Walcott and Grant McCool"

          "title": "CES kicks off with no lead women speakers or code of conduct",
          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The technology industry\u2019s premier annual gathering kicks off next week with no women leading the keynote sessions and no code of conduct that might prevent incidents of sexual harassment, despite efforts by organizers to cast the show as a more inclusive event.  CES, the showcase for the latest consumer electronics from televisions to self-driving cars, is known for mostly male attendees and female models known as \u2018booth babes\u2019 showing off the new technology.  It has attracted criticism for not making itself more welcoming for women or toning down its sexualized atmosphere even as the issue of harassment and assault has grabbed headlines in the last six months and propelled the #MeToo movement into life.  \u201cThe fact that this large global gathering of tech leaders is totally ignoring this issue makes them completely tone deaf and irresponsible,\u201d said Liliana Aide Monge, chief executive of California coding school Sabio, who is skipping CES for the second year in a row because of the lack of women and minority speakers.  The organizers of CES, which opens its doors to nearly 200,000 attendees in Las Vegas on Tuesday, drew criticism last month from executives at Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and other tech companies for a keynote list dominated by white men. CES made a concerted push to diversify its entire speaker lineup, but ultimately failed to find a high-ranking female executive for an individual keynote address.  \u201cTo keynote at CES, the speaker must head (president/CEO level) a large entity who has name recognition in the industry,\u201d said Karen Chupka, who oversees the event as senior vice president at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), in a blog post a month ago. \u201cAs upsetting as it is, there is a limited pool when it comes to women in these positions. We feel your pain. It bothers us, too. The tech industry and every industry must do better.\u201d  On top of that, CES also will go forward without creating a code of conduct, a mechanism several conferences in technology and other industries have adopted in recent years to set rules for behavior for attendees, from guidelines on using inclusive language in presentations to requirements that attendees wear name tags at all events, even after hours, to deter misconduct.   \u201cIt\u2019s sad that CES doesn\u2019t have a code of conduct,\u201d said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of ReadySet, a diversity-focused consulting firm. \u201cThey have a lot of influence. If they\u2019re choosing not to leverage that to promote diversity and inclusion at large, that communicates to the rest of the industry that maybe it isn\u2019t as necessary as we keep saying that it is.\u201d  Evidence of the effect on shows\u2019 safety and tone is mostly anecdotal, but several conferences with these codes, including hacker convention DEF CON, CoreOS Fest and Cloud Foundry Summit, say they have removed attendees after reports of harassment.   The stakes are high for the technology industry, rocked in the past year by a sexual harassment scandal at Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and misconduct by some prominent Silicon Valley investors.   The organizers of CES say they expect attendees to heed their own companies\u2019 standards of business conduct and will kick out anyone who behaves poorly, but will not introduce a set of guidelines.  \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily have specific rules because we assume everyone will be held accountable to the standards of being in an office,\u201d said Chupka.   \u201cUnacceptable\u201d behavior would be addressed by the executive team and legal counsel as necessary, the CTA said. \u201cWe have the right at any time to revoke a show badge and/or trespass an individual.\u201d CES notes that it has received no reports of sexual harassment at the event in recent years.   Women subjected to uncomfortable situations at or near past CES gatherings told Reuters that they did not report incidents because they were too used to it or did not recognize there was a way to do so.  To change that thinking, the show is debuting a security app that lets attendees report issues from crimes to broken elevators. While there will be no effort to promote the app specifically as a way to report sexual harassment, attendees may do so, and CES said its lawyers will be ready to act.  The need for a code of conduct became apparent at Finland\u2019s Slush tech startup event in 2016 when multiple women spoke up about being inappropriately touched and receiving unwanted propositions for sex by male attendees as well as being ignored by investors who were only interested in working with male entrepreneurs.   The following year, it doubled security, trained staff on how to handle reports of harassment and instituted a code of conduct, including a requirement to wear name badges at all times as a way to make it easier for attendees to identify a harasser.  A similar approach has been adopted by some in the U.S. tech industry. Salesforce.com Inc\u2019s (CRM.N) Dreamforce event, second only to CES in attendee numbers, added a code of conduct in 2014, while film, tech and music conference South by Southwest added one in 2016. Meanwhile, large conferences run by Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and RSA Security have not adopted such a code.  It remains to be seen if CES\u2019s lack of a code of conduct will prove costly.   Las Vegas\u2019 reputation for excess is part of the problem, said Liz Lopez, a tech marketing professional who has attended several industry conferences in the city.  \u201cPeople are over the edge in their behavior when they\u2019re in Vegas,\u201d she said.

          "title": "In test for Powell, internal groundswell grows to rethink Fed's inflation approach",
          "body": "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Pressure is building within the Federal Reserve for incoming Chairman Jerome Powell to consider a new strategy for raising U.S. inflation after more than five years of weakness that has baffled the central bank.  Three Fed policymakers added their voices this week to what is now a majority of regional Fed bank presidents urging, at the least, further study of alternatives to the current regime that targets a 2 percent inflation rate. Two others, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and John Williams of the San Francisco Fed, last year sparked renewed debate on the issue and went so far as to urge changes.  The internal groundswell comes a month before Powell is set to succeed Chair Janet Yellen in February, and poses an early leadership test that could rewrite the Fed\u2019s play book for how it characterizes and approaches its Congressional mandate to keep inflation low and steady.  The Fed currently has a simple inflation target, setting policy to keep annual inflation at 2 percent regardless of past performance. After years of falling short of this goal, the regional Fed bank heads are arguing that the time is right to consider more dynamic strategies.  One alternative, price-level targeting, would attempt to make up for years in which inflation is below or above two percent by over- or under-shooting that goal for a time. A related method targets gross domestic product at its overall or \u201cnominal\u201d level, before it is adjusted for inflation, and also promises to make up for lost ground with higher, inflation-fueled growth, in the future.  In the current situation, the recent years of missing inflation would be offset by lower-than-expected interest rates and higher-than-normal inflation until the overall price level is back where it would have been if annual inflation had averaged two percent annually.  The method in theory keeps output on a steady course over the long run, but carries risks as the Fed tries to convince investors and the public that higher inflation is only temporary, and under the central bank\u2019s control.   \u201cWe are not ready to snap our fingers and do it,\u201d St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who has often written about such level-targeting regimes in the past, said in an interview on Thursday in which he joined the growing call for a broad review. \u201cIt would take quite a few years (but) at a minimum you should ask\u201d if the benefits are worth it.  On Friday Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker also called for the Powell Fed to open a broad discussion.  \u201cI think he knows that there are these open issues that we need to think deeply about,\u201d Mester said of the incoming chair.  Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic round out the majority of the Fed\u2019s 12 district presidents who have called for changes or urged study of the inflation framework. That call has gained steam since the Fed\u2019s Oct. 31-Nov. 1 policy meeting, the minutes of which indicate that two members - likely Evans and Williams - suggested the Fed consider a system in which it committed to allowing higher inflation to make up for periods of low price rises.  The central bank\u2019s preferred core inflation measure largely has fallen short of 2 percent since it set its goal six years ago. Nonetheless it has raised rates five times in just over two years in a nod to strong employment, which is the Fed\u2019s other mandate.   Proponents say a healthy and growing economy warrants a steady \u201cnormalization\u201d of monetary policy. Opponents warn the Fed is raising rates needlessly, and sending the wrong signal with inflation still so weak.  The discussion has moved to the point where policymakers have begun putting numbers around what different regimes might have meant had they been in place. Bullard said that between 1995 and 2012 the Fed essentially maintained a price level target consistent with an annual 2 percent inflation rate. But since then a gap has emerged that now amounts to about 4.6 percent of nominal gross domestic product, a sizeable amount.  While Yellen said in December that the inflation target was not currently up for discussion, it is unclear where Powell, a Fed governor of five years, stands.  Recently released transcripts show Powell open to the opinions of others, and those who know him say one of his strengths is his open-mindedness. But as a non-economist he may also be hesitant to open, and have to moderate, a broad and politically controversial debate that would delve deep into monetary policy theory and navigate complex problems of statistical estimation.  Level-targeting regimes, in promising to \u201cmake up\u201d for lost ground, rest on assessing the size of past shortfalls. This could lead the Fed to tolerate excessive inflation, for example, if it relies on the frequently revised estimates of gross domestic product as part of its targeting system.   The U.S. would be the first major central bank to try such a system, and Mester, while open to the discussion, also pointed out several of the pitfalls.   \u201cNone of these alternative frameworks are without challenges and we will need to evaluate whether the net benefits of any of the alternatives would outweigh,\u201d the current system, she said.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched their best weekly gains in more than a year on Friday as technology stocks helped lift major indexes to records.  With the New Year\u2019s Day holiday falling on a Monday this year, it was the strongest first four trading days to a year in more than a decade for all three major indices, according to Reuters data. For the Dow, it was the strongest start since 2003 and for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 it was the strongest since 2006.  A U.S. tax overhaul last month that includes hefty corporate tax cuts helped to fuel late-year gains and was the first major legislative victory in President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda since he took office a year ago.      U.S. stocks this week have been adding to momentum from 2017, driven by a series of strong economic reports from across the globe and expectations for strong fourth-quarter earnings, with all three major indexes hitting milestones in the last few days.   The Dow broke above 25,000 for the first time on Thursday, while the S&P closed above 2,700 on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settled above 7,000 earlier in the week.  \u201cWe\u2019re up over 2 percent for the first four days of 2018, so that\u2019s pretty good. Markets are still working to figure out the implications of tax cuts, and that\u2019s provided some of the lift along with already good economic forecasts,\u201d said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank Private Client Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.  Weaker-than-expected December U.S. jobs data also could help the Federal Reserve stick to its policy of gradual interest rate hikes in 2018, which would be good for stocks, Baele said.  U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in December amid a decline in retail employment, but a pickup in monthly wages pointed to labor market strength. Non-farm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 190,000.       The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 220.74 points, or 0.88 percent, to 25,295.87, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 19.16 points, or 0.70 percent, to 2,743.15 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 58.64 points, or 0.83 percent, to 7,136.56.  The S&P technology index\u2019s .SPLRCT 1.2-percent gain led the advancers among the 11 major S&P sectors, with gains in Microsoft (MSFT.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) boosting the index.  The year\u2019s strong start follows a surprisingly sharp rally in 2017 that ended with the S&P 500 up 19.4 percent on the year.  For the week, the Dow rose 2.3 percent, the S&P 500 gained 2.6 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 3.4 percent. Those were the biggest weekly gains for the S&P and Nasdaq since December of 2016.  Among declining stocks, Francesca\u2019s Holdings (FRAN.O) tanked 20.7 percent. The women\u2019s apparel and accessories maker said it expected up to 17 percent decline in current-quarter same-store sales.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, the same as the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Switzerland's blue-chip SMI .SSMI hit an all-time high, rising 0.50 percent, and Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE also sailed to a new record and closed up 0.37 percent.  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.74 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.89 percent.   Emerging market stocks rose 0.71 percent.   U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday and the two-year yield held near a more than nine-year peak. Investors stuck to their view that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates multiple times this year despite a weaker-than-forecast December non-farms payroll report.  Non-farm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month, while economists had expected a rise of 190,000. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent, compared to 0.1 percent in November.  \u201cThis still represents a solid labor market,\u201d said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group of U.S. Bank in Helena, Montana. \u201cAs investors were able to sift through the data, they concluded it is not a harbinger for weaker economic activity.\u201d  Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.4763 percent, from 2.453 percent late on Thursday.  The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.8074 percent, from 2.786 percent late on Thursday.  The dollar index last .DXY rose 0.18 percent. The index briefly dipped following the release of the jobs report, but recovered shortly afterward.  The euro EUR= was down 0.31 percent to $1.203.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.31 percent at 113.10 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3563, up 0.09 percent on the day.  Oil prices fell with U.S. production soaring. Earlier in the week, prices climbed to highs last seen in 2015, boosted by tightening supply and political tensions in OPEC member Iran.  U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.74 percent to $61.55 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $67.71, down 0.53 percent on the day.  In commodities, zinc hit its highest in more than a decade as concerns over market tightness continued. Three-month zinc .CMZN3 on the London Metal Exchange was last bid at $3,355.16.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Hot favorite Nathan Chen had a hiccup with his final jump but still did enough to take a big short program lead in the men\u2019s competition at the U.S. figure skating championships on Thursday.  Probably the best chance for American gold at next month\u2019s Winter Olympics, the 18-year-old dazzled the crowd with his athleticism during a nearly three-minute routine in San Jose, California.  His technical score of 57.91 was more than eight points better than anyone else, and accounted entirely for his lead over Adam Rippon, who received a marginally better grade for artistry.  Chen received 104.45 points overall ahead of Rippon\u2019s 96.52, with Jason Brown third on 93.23.  Chen\u2019s short performance, ahead of Saturday\u2019s free skate, came despite battling a cold in recent weeks and, by his own admission, struggling a little in practice.  \u201cThe circumstances going into this competition weren\u2019t great but I\u2019ve struggled before with illness, with injury and I know I can push through anything and that\u2019s what I reminded myself of here,\u201d he said.  The only man to land five quad jumps in competition \u2014 a quad refers to four spinning revolutions in the air \u2014 Chen won the Grand Prix final in Japan on Dec. 8 and his class was on full display again on Thursday.  He made a confidence-boosting start by landing a quad flip-triple toe combination, and followed it up with an equally impressive quad toe.  Only on his final jump, a triple Axel, did he falter, stumbling upon landing but managing to regain his balance without touching his hand on the ice.   The U.S. championships offer a final chance for the men to impress selectors before three are named for the Pyeongchang Games.  In the pairs short program on Friday, the husband-and-wife duo of Chris and Alexa Knierim took the lead as they look to lock down the only U.S. berth on offer for South Korea.  \u201cSo far it wouldn\u2019t have gone any better,\u201d said Alexa.   The championships continue with the women\u2019s free skate on Friday night.  Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; editing by Amlan Chakraborty"

          "title": "Fitch Affirms First Midwest's Long-Term IDR at 'BBB-'; Ratings Withdrawn",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed and withdrawn the ratings for First Midwest Bancorp (FMBI) and its principal banking subsidiary First Midwest Bank (FMB) including the companies' Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'BBB-'. The ratings are being withdrawn with a Stable Outlook. As communicated on Dec. 6, 2017, Fitch is withdrawing the ratings for commercial reasons. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Viability Rating (VR) and IDRs Today's affirmation reflects FMBI's steady operating performance and solid execution of acquisitions to date. Today's affirmation also reflects FMBI's good funding profile, low cost of deposits and reasonable capital levels relative to its rating. Offsetting these strengths is FMBI's modest asset quality variability over recent periods as well as FMBI's geographic concentration within the greater Chicagoland operating market, which continues to be challenged economically and fiscally. After showing improvement for many quarters, FMBI's asset quality has shown variability which was previously incorporated into Fitch's rating expectations. FMBI's non-performing asset (NPA) ratio (inclusive of accruing troubled debt restructures) increased from 0.87% at June 30, 2016 (2Q16) to 1.05% at 2Q17. In 3Q17, the NPA ratio fell back down to 0.83% and net charge-offs (NCOs) increased to 30bps. NCOs have averaged just over 20bps over the last five quarters. Fitch expects FMBI's asset quality to normalize going forward as organic growth over the last few years well-exceeded peers and the industry and the new loans will continue to season. This expectation is reflected in today's rating affirmation. FMBI's earnings performance has remained in-line with expectations and has been incorporated into today's actions. Fitch notes that when excluding significant acquisition-related expenses and one-time gains, FMBI's return on average assets (ROA) has been around or below 1%, in-line with rated and direct peers. FMBI is now subject to the Durbin Amendment, due total consolidated assets exceeding $10 billion. This will adversely impact noninterest income at around $12 million per year, or approximately 7.5% of 2016 noninterest income. However, Fitch expects FMBI's larger loan portfolio to generate sufficient interest income such that the reduction in interchange revenue is reasonably offset. FMBI's solid funding profile continues to support its rating. Similar to most in its peer group and across the industry, FMBI has reduced its exposure to more volatile sources of funding through good core deposit growth enabled by interest rates that remain at historical lows. Fitch also expects FMBI to benefit from the ongoing actions of larger banks that need to comply with regulatory liquidity measures. These banks have been exiting collateralized deposit relationships, primarily with municipalities. Fitch expects these deposits to flow down to FMBI, keeping its loan-to-deposit ratio and funding costs at levels commensurate with its rating level. FMBI's cost of total deposits and interest bearing deposits of 14bps and 21bps, respectively through 3Q17, are considered strong and supportive of FMBI's current rating and Outlook. Fitch expects FMBI's capital position to modestly improve over the near- to medium-term, an expectation incorporated into today's affirmation. At 3Q17, FMBI's common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 9.4% was one of the lowest in Fitch's U.S. bank rated universe. However, Fitch observes that FMBI has kept its dividend payout ratio relatively low compared to others and currently does not have a share buyback program in place. Therefore, Fitch would expect the CET1 ratio to increase into the mid-9% range by the end of 2017 and into 2018. Moreover, Fitch notes that FMBI has a deferred gain of approximately $76 million pretax from its 2016 branch sale-leaseback transaction, which would add approximately 35bps to its CET1 ratio when realized. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR FMBI has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's view, FMBI is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of support is unlikely. The IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES FMBI's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR for loss severity, while any preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times for loss severity and three times for non-performance, and trust preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR. HOLDING COMPANY FMBI's IDR and VR are equalized with its operating company, First Midwest Bank, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS FMBI's uninsured deposit ratings at the subsidiary banks are rated one notch higher than the company's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, VR, SUPPORT RATING, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR, SUBORDINATED DEBT, OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES, HOLDING COMPANY, LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS Rating sensitivities are no longer relevant given today's rating withdrawal. Fitch has affirmed and withdrawn the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB-'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F3'; --Viability Rating at 'bbb-'; --Subordinated debt at 'BB+'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'. First Midwest Bank --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB-'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F3'; --Long-Term deposits at 'BBB'; --Short-Term deposits at 'F3'. --Viability Rating at 'bbb-'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched their best weekly gains in more than a year on Friday as technology stocks helped lift major indexes to records.  With the New Year\u2019s Day holiday falling on a Monday this year, it was the strongest first four trading days to a year in more than a decade for all three major indices, according to Reuters data. For the Dow, it was the strongest start since 2003 and for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 it was the strongest since 2006.  A U.S. tax overhaul last month that includes hefty corporate tax cuts helped to fuel late-year gains and was the first major legislative victory in President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda since he took office a year ago.      U.S. stocks this week have been adding to momentum from 2017, driven by a series of strong economic reports from across the globe and expectations for strong fourth-quarter earnings, with all three major indexes hitting milestones in the last few days.   The Dow broke above 25,000 for the first time on Thursday, while the S&P closed above 2,700 on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settled above 7,000 earlier in the week.  \u201cWe\u2019re up over 2 percent for the first four days of 2018, so that\u2019s pretty good. Markets are still working to figure out the implications of tax cuts, and that\u2019s provided some of the lift along with already good economic forecasts,\u201d said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank Private Client Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.  Weaker-than-expected December U.S. jobs data also could help the Federal Reserve stick to its policy of gradual interest rate hikes in 2018, which would be good for stocks, Baele said.  U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in December amid a decline in retail employment, but a pickup in monthly wages pointed to labor market strength. Non-farm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 190,000.       The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 220.74 points, or 0.88 percent, to 25,295.87, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 19.16 points, or 0.70 percent, to 2,743.15 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 58.64 points, or 0.83 percent, to 7,136.56.  The S&P technology index\u2019s .SPLRCT 1.2-percent gain led the advancers among the 11 major S&P sectors, with gains in Microsoft (MSFT.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) boosting the index.  The year\u2019s strong start follows a surprisingly sharp rally in 2017 that ended with the S&P 500 up 19.4 percent on the year.  For the week, the Dow rose 2.3 percent, the S&P 500 gained 2.6 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 3.4 percent. Those were the biggest weekly gains for the S&P and Nasdaq since December of 2016.  Among declining stocks, Francesca\u2019s Holdings (FRAN.O) tanked 20.7 percent. The women\u2019s apparel and accessories maker said it expected up to 17 percent decline in current-quarter same-store sales.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, the same as the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Internet Association, a trade group representing companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O), said on Friday that it intends to join an expected lawsuit against a decision to roll back net neutrality rules.  One of the group\u2019s members, e-commerce site Etsy Inc (ETSY.O), said that it would separately also join the legal effort. Several states including New York, and public interest advocacy groups have said they intend to sue to stop the mid-December ruling by the Federal Communications Commission.  The approval of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai\u2019s proposal in a 3-2 vote marked a victory for internet service providers such as AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), handing them power over what content consumers can access.  Democrats, Hollywood and companies such as Google and Facebook had urged Pai, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to keep the Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content.   \u201cThe final version of Chairman Pai\u2019s rule, as expected, dismantles popular net neutrality protections for consumers. This rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,\u201d the Internet Association said in a statement.  Etsy called the decision to overturn net neutrality rules \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d   \u201cEtsy is continuing to fight for a free and open Internet; that\u2019s why we intend to challenge Chairman Pai\u2019s order in the courts,\u201d Althea Erickson, Etsy\u2019s head of advocacy and impact, said in a statement.  The new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers.  Internet Association members also include Airbnb, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and several dozen online and social media companies.  Reporting by Chris Sanders and Diane Bartz; Editing by Susan Thomas"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Internet Association, a trade group representing companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O), said on Friday that it intends to join an expected lawsuit against a decision to roll back net neutrality rules.  One of the group\u2019s members, e-commerce site Etsy Inc (ETSY.O), said that it would separately also join the legal effort. Several states including New York, and public interest advocacy groups have said they intend to sue to stop the mid-December ruling by the Federal Communications Commission.  The approval of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai\u2019s proposal in a 3-2 vote marked a victory for internet service providers such as AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), handing them power over what content consumers can access.  Democrats, Hollywood and companies such as Google and Facebook had urged Pai, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to keep the Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content.   \u201cThe final version of Chairman Pai\u2019s rule, as expected, dismantles popular net neutrality protections for consumers. This rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,\u201d the Internet Association said in a statement.  Etsy called the decision to overturn net neutrality rules \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d   \u201cEtsy is continuing to fight for a free and open Internet; that\u2019s why we intend to challenge Chairman Pai\u2019s order in the courts,\u201d Althea Erickson, Etsy\u2019s head of advocacy and impact, said in a statement.  The new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers.  Internet Association members also include Airbnb, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and several dozen online and social media companies.  Reporting by Chris Sanders and Diane Bartz; Editing by Susan Thomas"

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Friday reiterated its stance that accounts belonging to world leaders have special status on the social media network, pushing back against users who have called on the company to banish U.S. President Donald Trump.   \u201cBlocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,\u201d Twitter said in a post on a corporate blog.   Twitter had already said in September that \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d and whether a tweet is \u201cof public interest\u201d are among the factors it considers before removing an account or a tweet.   The debate over Trump\u2019s tweeting, though, raged anew after Trump said from his @realDonaldTrump account on Tuesday that he had a \u201cmuch bigger\u201d and \u201cmore powerful\u201d nuclear button than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.   Critics said that tweet and Trump\u2019s continued presence on the network endanger the world and violate Twitter\u2019s ban on threats of violence. Some users protested at Twitter\u2019s San Francisco headquarters on Wednesday.   Twitter responded in its blog post that even if it did block a world leader, doing so would not silence that leader.  The company said that it does review tweets by world leaders and enforces its rules accordingly, leaving open the possibility that it could take down some material posted by them.   \u201cNo one person\u2019s account drives Twitter\u2019s growth, or influences these decisions,\u201d the company added. \u201cWe work hard to remain unbiased with the public interest in mind.\u201d  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Twitter\u2019s statement.   Some Twitter users expressed support for the company\u2019s decision, while others complained of a double standard.   \u201cIf I tweeted half of what Trump has since he entered office, I\u2019d be permanently banned from this platform,\u201d a Twitter user wrote from the account @michaelranaii.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) said on Friday it would take a $1.25 billion hit in its fourth-quarter earnings due to a cut in corporate tax rate as part of the U.S. tax code overhaul.   The net blow of the bill to the bank will include about a $1.4 billion net discrete tax provision, mainly due to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lowered corporate tax rate, the company said in a filing.   It would be offset by $160 million in other positive effects, Morgan Stanley added.(bit.ly/2m0QVsB)  The sweeping tax code changes enacted in late December cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and were expected to mean short-term pain, but long-term gain for U.S.-based corporations.  Scores of large companies, including big banks such as Citigroup (C.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), have socked away an estimated $2.8 trillion overseas in recent years.   The one-time tax on those earnings is expected to raise $339 billion in federal revenues over the coming decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), a nonpartisan research arm of the U.S. Congress.  Morgan Stanley\u2019s arch rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) had said on Dec. 29 it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to decrease by about $5 billion due to repatriation tax, the cost of moving money from foreign countries to the U.S., Goldman said in a filing.

          "title": "Republican Senators seek criminal probe of Trump 'dossier' author",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior Republican U.S. Senators on Friday called for a criminal investigation into the former British spy who compiled a \u201cdossier\u201d in 2016 of allegations of financial and personal links between then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, his advisers and Russia.  Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, who respectively chair the Senate Judiciary Committee and one of its subcommittees, sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in which they said former spy Christopher Steele made \u201cfalse statements\u201d about his sharing information in the dossier with U.S. media outlets.  Grassley and Graham are supporters of a campaign by President Trump and some Republicans to demonize Steele and his dossier and cast doubt over the credibility of official U.S. investigations, including one led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The probes are looking into allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to help Republican Trump. Moscow denies interference and Trump denies any collusion.  In the letter released by the senators, Grassley and Graham neither identify anyone to whom they believed Steele lied nor do they identify any news outlet. The letter makes reference to a \u201cTop Secret\u201d memo that they said relates to \u201ccertain communications between Christopher Steele and multiple U.S. news outlets\u201d regarding the \u201cdossier.\u201d  Steele had no immediate comment.  After Trump won the Republican nomination in July 2016, backers of Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton started financing Steele\u2019s work via Washington research firm Fusion GPS. The firm had also worked on \u201copposition research\u201d for one of Trump\u2019s opponents in the Republican primary.  In an emailed comment, Joshua Levy, a lawyer for Fusion GPS, suggested that the senators\u2019 letter was an effort to undermine the special counsel\u2019s investigation.  \u201cAfter a year of investigations into Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, the only person Republicans seek to accuse of wrongdoing is one who reported on these matters to law enforcement in the first place,\u201d Levy said. \u201cWe should all be skeptical in the extreme.\u201d  Although several news organizations, including Reuters, were briefed on Steele\u2019s dossier before the November 2016 election, most decided not to report on the material because its inflammatory and sometimes salacious content could not be verified.  Congressional panels, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, set out to investigate U.S. intelligence agency allegations that Russia conducted a campaign of hacking and disinformation to undermine U.S. democracy in the election, but some of the bipartisanship has eroded. Graham, Grassley and some other Republicans have used official resources to investigate the Steele dossier, Trump critics and officials working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mueller.  Two Trump campaign associates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and aide George Papadopoulos have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in Mueller\u2019s probe.  U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, on Friday criticized the Republicans\u2019 letter.  \u201cThis action was taken without any bipartisan cooperation, or even consultation,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement. \u201cThese vaguely stated, secret allegations seem designed more to distract attention from the priority issues for investigation, and discredit the FBI and other law enforcement.\u201d  The Democratic senator said it was \u201cindisputable fact\u201d that the probe of Russian meddling in the election and any possible Trump campaign role \u201cwas triggered by information completely independent from the dossier.\u201d  Reporting By Mark Hosenball; editing by Grant McCool"

          "body": "(Reuters. - Intel Corp shares fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday as investors worried about the potential financial liability and reputational hit from recently disclosed security flaws in its widely used microprocessors.   The largest chipmaker had confirmed on Wednesday that flaws reported by researchers could allow hackers to steal sensitive information from computers, phones and other devices. Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and other software makers have issued patches to protect against the vulnerabilities.  Intel may be on the hook for costs stemming from lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers will likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make, security experts said.   \u201cThe potential liability is big for Intel,\u201d said Eric Johnson, dean of Vanderbilt University\u2019s Owen Graduate School of Management. \u201cEverybody will be scrambling over the next few days to figure out just how big it is.\u201d   Intel has said that the patches for the bugs would slow its chips down somewhat but that most users will not notice.   Amazon Web Services (AWS), the largest seller of cloud computing services, said in a statement it does not \u201cexpect meaningful performance impact for most customer workloads.\u201d  Microsoft and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google both said in statements on their websites that they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers.  But the incident is likely to spur cloud companies to press Intel for lower prices on chips in future talks, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, which owns shares in Intel.   \u201cWhat (Intel\u2019s cloud customers) are going to say is, \u2018You wronged us, we hate you, but if we can get a discount, we\u2019ll still buy from you,\u2019\u201d  Forrest said.   Forrest also expects Intel will have to increase its chip development spending to focus on security.   Government agencies and security experts said they knew of no cyber attacks that had exploited the vulnerabilities.  Financial services firms were studying information on the vulnerabilities to determine how to best respond, said the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a global industry group known as FS-ISAC that shares data on cyber threats.  Banks and other firms are trying to understand what it will cost to respond to the issue, FS-ISAC said in an emailed statement.  \u201cIn addition to the security considerations raised by this design flaw, performance degradation is expected, which could require more processing power for affected systems to compensate and maintain current baseline performance,\u201d FS-ISAC said. \u201cThere will need to be consideration and balance between fixing the potential security threat vs the performance and other possible impact to systems.\u201d   Lawyers filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California, federal court on Wednesday that sought class action status and compensation for people who had bought vulnerable Intel chips or computers that came with them already installed.   Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the lawsuit.   While more lawsuits are expected, Intel\u2019s biggest customers are likely to quietly seek compensation for any harm caused by the vulnerabilities, including costs to patch machines or replace microprocessors, Johnson said.  Legal experts said that consumers would have to prove concrete damages and harm to proceed with claims.   Intel shares fell 1.8 percent, following a 3.4 percent decline Wednesday.   Shares in rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc climbed 4.9 percent as investors speculated the No. 2 maker of microprocessors would woo customers away from Intel.   Still, researchers had said some of AMD\u2019s chips had one of the two vulnerabilities disclosed on Wednesday, as do processors from ARM Holdings.

Approval had been expected in early 2018 after phone company Telecom Argentina SA and Cablevision SA, an internet, cable TV and data transmission company, reached a merger agreement in July.  Enacom also said on Friday it had authorized mobile phone providers Claro and Telefonica licenses to offer pay television and radio services in select cities in Argentina.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Value stocks are getting a once-over from some U.S. growth fund managers in early 2018 as they prowl for overlooked shares they think have more upside in a market that gained nearly 20 percent last year.   Value stocks, so labeled because they typically sport lower price-to-earnings valuations, tend to be in more staid or out-of-favor industries and often lag during outsized stock rallies, which is exactly what happened in 2017.   The S&P 500 Value index .IVX - a measure of companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) - gained just 12.6 percent last year. That is a tortoise\u2019s pace measured against the far more hare-like S&P 500 Growth index .IGX, which doubled that performance. It clocked a 25.4-percent rise courtesy of its heavy contingent of tech giants like Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).  As a result, even some growth funds are moving out of high-flying technology stocks and increasing their positions in  stocks they see as more reasonably valued at a time when the American Association of Individual Investors survey shows the greatest exuberance for stocks since November 2014.   \u201cThere is some risk to the technology sector after the big run we\u2019ve had. Where we see opportunities now are sectors that have attractive valuations and higher visibility into their revenue streams,\u201d said Matthew Litfin, a co-portfolio manager of the $4.7-billion Columbia Acorn fund (ACRNX.O).  Litfin is now underweight technology and has been adding to its holdings of financial stocks, such as asset management Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N), which trades at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 15.1 versus 23.7 for the S&P 500 .SPX as a whole. Lazard shares are up 5.8 percent so far in 2018.  Thyra Zerhusen, a co-portfolio manager of the $4.2 billion Fairepoint Capital Mid Cap fund (CHTTX.O), said she has been moving into the likes of toymaker Mattel Inc (MAT.O) and General Electric Co (GE.N), whose corporate upheavals overshadow the value of their underlying assets.   GE, for instance, trades at a trailing P/E of 21.2, and its shares are down 41.7 percent over the last year as new chief executive John Flannery has announced plans to shrink the company and exit some of its sprawling business lines. Shares of Mattel, meanwhile, slid 46 percent over the last 12 months as it suspended its dividend and cited the bankruptcy of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, the biggest U.S. toy retailer, as a factor in its weak sales.   \u201cLast year was not a good environment for value, but now is a time when you can find investments that will go up substantially over the next two years,\u201d she said.  So far so good: Mattel is up 4.3 percent since the new year rang in, and GE is up 6.1 percent. The S&P is up about 2.3 percent.   A good year for growth stocks does not necessarily mean that value stocks will bounce back the following year, of course.   In the 20 previous occasions that the S&P 500 jumped by more than 18 percent in one year since 1951, the index rose by an additional 10 percent or more the following year 10 times, according to Credit Suisse, with growth stocks leading the way. The other 10 times the S&P on average declined 1.7 percent the next year.  Over the first three trading days of 2018, the iShares S&P 500 Growth index ETF (IVW.P) is up 2.9 percent, while the iShares S&P 500 Value index ETF (IVE.P) is up 1.6 percent.   Yet Matthew Watson, a portfolio manager at James Advantage funds, said that his firm has been bracing for a significant correction in the so-called FAANG group of large tech stocks, such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) that jumped by 30 percent or more in 2017 and pulled the broad index higher.   Instead, the firm has been adding to positions in out-of-favor energy stocks such as Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc (DO.N) and retailers such as Macy\u2019s Inc (M.N) that have under-appreciated assets, he said.   Macy\u2019s, for instance, is trading barely above the value of its underlying real estate portfolio, Watson said, while Diamond Offshore trades at 70 percent of its book value, a measure of the value of the assets on a company\u2019s balance sheet. Macy\u2019s is down 3.3 percent in the first week of 2018, while Diamond Offshore is up 2.1 percent.  \u201cThere may be positive momentum in the stock market right now, but that is only going to make it more expensive,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe think that the only choice you have now to find opportunities that will pay off in the long-run is to look for value.\u201d   (The story was refiled to corrects \u2018fund\u2019 to \u2018funds\u2019 in paragraph 4)  Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Dan Burns and Nick Zieminski"

Approval had been expected in early 2018 after phone company Telecom Argentina SA and Cablevision SA, an internet, cable TV and data transmission company, reached a merger agreement in July.  Enacom also said on Friday it had authorized mobile phone providers Claro and Telefonica licenses to offer pay television and radio services in select cities in Argentina.   Cable TV provider Supercanal Sociedad An\u00f3nima would also be allowed to offer mobile phone service, Enacom said.  \u201cThe government is encouraging the convergence of services like quadruple play that mean more offers for users and better quality communication,\u201d Enacom President Miguel De Godoy said in the statement.  In December Enacom approved the Telecom Argentina and Cablevision merger on the condition that the combined company divest 80 of its estimated 220 megahertz to avoid exceeding the government airwaves limit. The merger still needs approval from Argentina\u2019s CNDC antitrust regulator.  The government of business-friendly President Mauricio Macri said in late 2016 it expected Telecom reforms to attract $20 billion in investments over four years.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Kansas businessman and race car driver was sentenced to 16 years and 8 months in prison on Friday for crimes related to his online payday lending business, which prosecutors said made more than $3.5 billion as it exploited millions of cash-strapped consumers.  Scott Tucker, 55, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan. He was found guilty by a jury in October of violating federal truth in lending and racketeering laws.  Tucker did not make a statement at his sentencing, referring instead to a letter he submitted to the court in December. In that letter, Tucker said he was \u201cremorseful\u201d for \u201cthe misperception that I do not recognize my responsibility to live as a good and fair business man, employer, and American citizen.\u201d  Castel said the letter showed Tucker had not accepted that his conduct was criminal.  \u201cThe notion that Mr. Tucker is just an honest businessman doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d he said.  Tucker\u2019s lawyer, Lee Ginsburg, said he would appeal.  Castel also sentenced Timothy Muir, 46, a lawyer who worked with Tucker and was convicted of the same charges in October, to seven years in prison. Muir\u2019s lawyer, Thomas Bath, said he would appeal as well.  Tucker and Muir were indicted in February 2016 amid efforts by the federal government to crack down on abuses by payday lending companies.  Such companies say they help consumers by offering small loans that are to be repaid in a short time, often from the person\u2019s next paycheck, but critics say they exploit borrowers through high interest rates and fees.  Prosecutors said Tucker\u2019s Kansas-based business, which operated under names including Ameriloan and OneClickCash, routinely charged interest rates as high as 700 percent, exploiting more than 4 million people from 1997 to 2013.  After several states brought lawsuits over the lending, prosecutors said, Tucker entered into sham relationships with Native American tribes. By claiming his companies were owned by tribes, prosecutors said, Tucker was able to shield the companies from lawsuits using tribal sovereign immunity.  Tucker, who has competed on U.S. and European racing circuits, was previously convicted of making a false statement to obtain a bank loan and of running a fraudulent financial services business. He was sentenced in 1991 to a year in a federal prison for the latter crime.  Tucker was also charged in Kansas last month with filing a false tax return. That case remains pending.

          "body": "(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday declared unconstitutional a Baltimore law requiring pregnancy clinics that do not offer or refer women for abortions to post signs disclosing that fact in their waiting rooms.  The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that the law violated the First Amendment free speech rights of the Greater Baltimore Center for Pregnancy Concerns, a Christian nonprofit that provides prenatal services and counsels women on abortion alternatives.  Friday\u2019s decision in the nearly eight-year-old case followed dozens of court submissions from abortion rights, anti-abortion and religious freedom advocates, and came as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to consider a similar case from California.  Maryland\u2019s largest city had argued that its 2009 law was meant to address deceptive advertising and reduce the potential health risks from waiting too long to have an abortion.  Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, however, wrote for the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court that Baltimore\u2019s approach amounted to \u201ctoo loose a fit\u201d with those ends.  \u201cThe ordinance forces the center to utter in its own waiting room words at odds with its foundational beliefs and with the principles of those who have given their working lives to it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWithout proving the inefficacy of less restrictive alternatives, providing concrete evidence of deception, or more precisely targeting its regulation, the city cannot prevail.\u201d  Friday\u2019s decision upheld an October 2016 ruling by U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis in Baltimore.  \u201cThis court ruling means that we can do our job and the government can\u2019t tell us what to say or how to say it,\u201d the clinic\u2019s executive director Carol Clews said in a statement.  Ten U.S. states with Republican attorneys general supported the clinic.  Suzanne Sangree, a lawyer who argued Baltimore\u2019s appeal, said the city was disappointed, and may appeal to the Supreme Court and perhaps also submit a brief in the California case.  In that case, the Supreme Court is expected by June to decide whether California violates the free speech rights of private \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d opposed to abortion by requiring signs about how to obtain state-sponsored services including abortion and contraception.  California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, has said the law, upheld by a federal appeals court in San Francisco in October 2016, helps inform women about their options.  Wilkinson called the California disclaimer \u201cmarkedly different\u201d from Baltimore\u2019s, and said a separate requirement that unlicensed clinics disclose their lack of licensing does not mention abortion.

NBC reported in October that Tillerson referred to the president as a \u201cmoron\u201d after a Pentagon meeting in July. In November, there were reports the White House was contemplating replacing him.  Tillerson told CNN the president had given him no indication his job was in jeopardy.   The CNN interview coincided with the release of a sharply critical book on Trump\u2019s first year as president. The book portrayed the U.S. leader as behaving like a child and raised new questions about his fitness for public office.  Asked if he shared the assessment that Trump was not mentally fit for office, Tillerson said: \u201cI\u2019ve never questioned his mental fitness. I have no reason to question his mental fitness.\u201d  Tillerson said it took him a while to learn how to best communicate with Trump, who he did not know before becoming secretary of state. Tillerson, a former Exxon chief executive, said he and the president had different management and decision-making styles.  \u201cI\u2019ve had to spend a lot of time understanding how to best communicate with him so I can serve his needs with information,\u201d Tillerson told CNN.  \u201cSomething I had to learn is what is effective with this president,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cHe is not typical of presidents of the past. I think that\u2019s well recognized. That\u2019s also though why the American people chose him.\u201d  He said he tries to brief Trump on all sides of an issue, \u201ceven when I know it\u2019s not the side that he really wants to consider.\u201d  \u201cPeople should feel good about the way decisions are made because it\u2019s not just one of giving in to what you think the president wants, rather helping him see the full array of all of the options,\u201d Tillerson said.

          "body": "(Updates market action, adds graphic)  NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. bond market\u2019s gauges of inflation expectations rose on Friday to their highest levels since at least April on expectations of a pick-up in wage growth in 2018 following the government\u2019s payrolls report.  The U.S. Labor Department said earlier Friday average hourly earnings grew 0.3 percent in December, matching analyst expectations and bringing their year-over-year increase to 2.5 percent.  The earnings increase came before passage of the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years late last month, which some analysts and investors reckon may spark a pick-up in wage inflation.  \u201cThe market thinks this number is not super relevant because this was before tax reform, related salary increases and bonuses. We could see some traction in wage inflation in the next three to six months,\u201d said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors LLC in Minneapolis.  The in-line wage increase offset a smaller-than-forecast 148,000 rise in nonfarm payrolls due to a sharp decline in retail jobs.  Underlying domestic inflation has remained stuck below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2-percent goal despite a tightening labor market.  The 10-year inflation breakeven rate, or the yield gap between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and regular 10-year Treasury notes, rose to 2.03 percent, up 2 basis points from Thursday. This was the closing level on the 10-year TIPS breakeven rate since March, Tradeweb data showed.  The five-year TIPS breakeven rate ended up 2.5 basis points at 1.94 percent, which was the highest closing levels since last April.  The 30-year breakeven rate finished over 1 basis point at 2.06 percent, the highest closing level since last April.  TIPS breakeven rates have risen in recent days in step with a spike in commodity prices with oil futures reaching their highest since May 2015 earlier this week.

          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The Internet Association, a trade group representing companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, said on Friday it intends to join an expected lawsuit against a decision to roll back net neutrality rules.  Several states including New York, and public interest advocacy groups have said they intend to sue to stop the mid-December ruling by the Federal Communications Commission.  The approval of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai\u2019s proposal in a 3-2 vote marked a victory for internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, handing them power over what content consumers can access.  Democrats, Hollywood and companies such as Google parent Alphabet and Facebook had urged Pai, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to keep the Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content.  \u201cThe final version of Chairman Pai\u2019s rule, as expected, dismantles popular net neutrality protections for consumers. This rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,\u201d the Internet Association said in a statement.  The new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers.  Internet Association members also include Airbnb, Etsy Inc, Amazon.com and several dozen online and social media companies. (Reporting by Chris Sanders; Editing by Susan Thomas)"

Scott Tucker, 55, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan. He was found guilty by a jury in October of violating federal truth in lending and racketeering laws.  Tucker did not make a statement at his sentencing, referring instead to a letter he submitted to the court in December. In that letter, Tucker said he was \u201cremorseful\u201d for \u201cthe misperception that I do not recognize my responsibility to live as a good and fair business man, employer, and American citizen.\u201d  Castel said the letter showed Tucker had not accepted that his conduct was criminal.  \u201cThe notion that Mr. Tucker is just an honest businessman doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d he said.  Tucker\u2019s lawyer, Lee Ginsburg, said he would appeal.  Castel also sentenced Timothy Muir, 46, a lawyer who worked with Tucker and was convicted of the same charges in October, to seven years in prison. Muir\u2019s lawyer, Thomas Bath, could not immediately be reached for comment.  Tucker and Muir were indicted in February 2016 amid efforts by the federal government to crack down on abuses by payday lending companies.  Such companies say they help consumers by offering small loans that are to be repaid in a short time, often from the person\u2019s next paycheck, but critics say they exploit borrowers through high interest rates and fees.  Prosecutors said Tucker\u2019s Kansas-based business, which operated under names including Ameriloan and OneClickCash, routinely charged interest rates as high as 700 percent, exploiting more than 4 million people from 1997 to 2013.  After several states brought lawsuits over the lending, prosecutors said, Tucker entered into sham relationships with Native American tribes. By claiming his companies were owned by tribes, prosecutors said, Tucker was able to shield the companies from lawsuits using tribal sovereign immunity.  Tucker, who has competed on U.S. and European racing circuits, was previously convicted of making a false statement to obtain a bank loan and of running a fraudulent financial services business. He was sentenced in 1991 to a year in a federal prison for the latter crime.  Tucker was also charged in Kansas last month with filing a false tax return. That case remains pending.

The lawsuit has since been settled, according to federal court records.  Massachusetts in 2016 passed a law banning discrimination against transgender people in public restrooms and other public buildings.  The woman, who was diagnosed with gender dysphoria decades ago, claimed in the lawsuit that she has been routinely groped by male guards during strip searches and is forced to shower in the presence of male inmates.

          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - Pregnant women who take drugs like Ritalin and Concerta for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely than those who don\u2019t to have babies with heart deformities and other birth defects, a recent study suggests.   Researchers examined data on more than 1.8 million pregnancies in the U.S., including 2,072 women who used methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, Daytrana) and 5,571 who took an amphetamine (Adderall) during their first trimester.   Overall, women who took methylphenidate were 11 percent more likely to have a baby with birth defects and 28 percent more likely to have infants with heart malformations than women who didn\u2019t take stimulants for ADHD during pregnancy.  There was no increased risk of birth defects in general or heart malformations specifically with amphetamines like Adderall, the researchers found.  \u201cOur findings suggest that there might be a small increase in the risk of cardiac malformations associated with intrauterine exposure to methylphenidate,\u201d said lead study author Krista Huybrechts of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.   \u201cAlthough the absolute risk is small, it is nevertheless important evidence to consider when weighing the potential risks and benefits of different treatment strategies for ADHD in young women of reproductive age and in pregnant women,\u201d Huybrechts said by email.   An estimated 3 percent of children, teens and adults have ADHD, researchers note in JAMA Psychiatry. Stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin are among the most commonly prescribed medications for the condition, and these drugs are increasingly being used by women of childbearing age.   All of the women in the current study had health insurance through Medicaid, the U.S. benefits program for the poor.   Among children of women who were not taking stimulants for ADHD, 35 out of every 1,000 babies had birth defects, compared with 46 out of every 1,000 infants born to women using drugs like Ritalin.    To assess whether these results were unique to the U.S. or to women on Medicaid, researchers also examined health registry data for more than 2.5 million pregnancies in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.   In the Nordic data, drugs like Ritalin were also associated with a 28 percent higher risk of heart malformations in babies.   The study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how specific ADHD drugs might cause birth defects.   Because the study only included live births, it didn\u2019t explore whether the drugs might increase the risks of severe birth defects that lead to miscarriage or stillbirths or that prompt women to terminate pregnancies, the authors note.   \u201cIf a woman has mild symptoms, it might be possible to avoid use of the medicine during pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. William Cooper, a researcher at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial.   \u201cHowever, if the woman has severe symptoms that interfere with her daily function, the results of this study can help to guide decisions on whether to continue,\u201d Cooper said by email.   It may also make sense for some women with ADHD to consider stopping or changing medications when they\u2019re trying to conceive, Huybrechts said.   \u201cConsidering the high rate of unplanned pregnancies among young women, the potential for accidental exposure is also very high,\u201d Huybrechts said. \u201cAlthough the absolute risk is small, it is nevertheless important evidence to consider when weighing the potential risks and benefits of different treatment strategies for ADHD in young women of reproductive age and in pregnant women.\u201d  SOURCES: bit.ly/2m33rry and bit.ly/2qubOB0 JAMA Psychiatry, online December 13, 2017.

Michael Gluk, 59, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin, Texas, after pleading guilty in June to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud, the U.S. Justice Department said.  The sentencing came after Gluk in August testified at the trial of former ArthroCare Chief Executive Officer Michael Baker, who was convicted of securities fraud, wire fraud and other charges and sentenced in November to 20 years in prison.  Both men were convicted at a trial in 2014. But a federal appeals court in January 2016 overturned their convictions after finding that evidence was improperly excluded from the trial.  Gluk had been serving a prison sentence of 10 years when the appeals court overturned his conviction. He is expected, as part of his new sentence of 50 months in prison, to receive credit for the 13 months that his lawyers said he had already served.  Sparks ordered Gluk to pay a $50,000 fine and to forfeit $677,804, the Justice Department said. A lawyer for Gluk did not respond to a request for comment.  Prosecutors said Baker and Gluk, along with others, schemed from 2005 to 2009 to prop up ArthroCare\u2019s stock price by artificially inflating sales and revenue through a series of  transactions with distributors.

          "body": "(Reuters) - The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has transferred $1.46 billion of risk from its flood insurance program to 28 private reinsurers for 2018, the agency said on Friday.  FEMA, which paid $235 million for the coverage, said the reinsurance agreement covers portions of its National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) losses above $4 billion stemming from a single flooding event.  NFIP, a federal program that is the only source of flood insurance for most Americans, has been saddled with tens of billions of dollars in debt to the U.S. Treasury. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria added to the program\u2019s woes in 2017.  Buying reinsurance helps NFIP offset some of its financial risks. It is a fairly new practice for NFIP, which Congress empowered to undertake through laws in 2012 and 2014.   Previously, NFIP had to pay claims by using only flood insurance premiums, surplus, borrowing capacity from the U.S. Treasury and appropriations from Congress.   The 2018 reinsurance program covers 18.6 percent of NFIP losses of between $4 billion and $6 billion and 54.3 percent of losses between $6 billion and $8 billion, FEMA said.  More than 91,000 Hurricane Harvey survivors filed NFIP claims as of Jan. 1, with FEMA paying over $7.6 billion to those policyholders, the agency said. FEMA recovered $1.04 billion of those losses through reinsurance it bought in 2017, the agency said.  Guy Carpenter and Company, a unit of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (MMC.N), brokered the deal and reinsurance broker Aon Benfield, an Aon Plc unit (AON.N), advised on financial issues, FEMA said.

          "body": "(Reuters) - The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has transferred $1.46 billion of risk from its flood insurance program to 28 private reinsurers for 2018, the agency said on Friday.  FEMA, which paid $235 million for the coverage, said the reinsurance agreement covers portions of its National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) losses above $4 billion stemming from a single flooding event.  NFIP, a federal program that is the only source of flood insurance for most Americans, has been saddled with tens of billions of dollars in debt to the U.S. Treasury. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria added to the program\u2019s woes in 2017.  Buying reinsurance helps NFIP offset some of its financial risks. It is a fairly new practice for NFIP, which Congress empowered to undertake through laws in 2012 and 2014.   Previously, NFIP had to pay claims by using only flood insurance premiums, surplus, borrowing capacity from the U.S. Treasury and appropriations from Congress.   The 2018 reinsurance program covers 18.6 percent of NFIP losses of between $4 billion and $6 billion and 54.3 percent of losses between $6 billion and $8 billion, FEMA said.  More than 91,000 Hurricane Harvey survivors filed NFIP claims as of Jan. 1, with FEMA paying over $7.6 billion to those policyholders, the agency said. FEMA recovered $1.04 billion of those losses through reinsurance it bought in 2017, the agency said.  Guy Carpenter and Company, a unit of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (MMC.N), brokered the deal and reinsurance broker Aon Benfield, an Aon Plc unit (AON.N), advised on financial issues, FEMA said.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - While many athletes dream of competing at successive Winter Olympics, American freestyle skier McRae Williams knows that at the age of 27, next month\u2019s Games in Pyeongchang could be his first and last shot at Olympic glory.  In a sport where even teenagers can dominate, Williams\u2019 breakout year did not come until he was 24 when he won the men\u2019s ski slopestyle competition at the 2013 X Games in Tignes, France.   Since then, he has added two podium finishes and appears to have peaked at just the right time heading into an Olympic season.  The previous Winter Games in Sochi came too early in Williams\u2019 blossoming career. But whether he is successful or not in getting to South Korea, the Utah resident says he has already achieved everything he ever dreamed of growing up by competing and winning medals at the X Games.  Speaking at Team USA\u2019s training camp in Austria, Williams did say, however, that he was determined to make the most of what may be his only opportunity of adding an Olympic medal to his collection.   \u201cI didn\u2019t make it in 2014 so it is a big deal and I am 27 so this might be my last shot at it so I am going to give it my all,\u201d said Williams whilst relaxing on a slack line outside the team\u2019s hotel.  He added: \u201cAt 27 I am getting nervous. I am getting older and seeing the end of my career a little bit and starting to think about what is next and I can\u2019t imagine doing anything else. I have been doing this for so long.\u201d  Williams, who resides in Salt Lake City - the venue of the 2002 Winter Games - insists that he will be happy as long as he performs to his maximum capability.   He also plans to showcase a new trick, details of which he refused to disclose.   \u201cIf it is something you have been working hard at and you have a particular trick you have been working on for a slopestyle run or in Big Air or whatever, just to land that under the pressure is an achievement in itself, personally,\u201d he  said.  \u201cObviously winning feels good too but, if you ski your best and have a good time out there then that is a win for everybody.\u201d  Pyeongchang may be the pinnacle for Williams in his career, yet even though he cast doubt on being involved in the next Games scheduled to take place in Beijing in 2022, he will not be shelving his skis anytime soon.   Williams will be found with his friends, shredding powder in the Utah backcountry.  \u201cI will probably end up going back to school one of these days and doing the real life thing,\u201d said Williams. \u201cBut I am going to live this out as long as I can.\u201d  There remain two U.S. qualifying events this month for Williams to either collect enough ranking points or impress the judges sufficiently to book his place in South Korea.

U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month. Economists were forecasting job gains of 190,000.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - A major outbreak of coral-eating crown of thorns starfish has been found munching Australia\u2019s world heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, scientists said on Friday, prompting the government to begin culling the spiky marine animals.  The predator starfish feeds on corals by spreading its stomach over them and using digestive enzymes to liquefy tissue, and the outbreak hits as the reef is still reeling from two consecutive years of major coral bleaching.  \u201cEach starfish eats about its body diameter a night, and so over time that mounts up very significantly,\u201d Hugh Sweatman, a senior research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science told Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio.  \u201cA lot of coral will be lost,\u201d he said.  That would mean a blow for both the ecosystem and the lucrative tourism industry which it supports.     The crown of thorns were found in plague proportions last month in the Swains Reefs, at the southern edge of the Great Barrier Reef, by researchers from the reef\u2019s Marine Park Authority, a spokeswoman for the authority told Reuters by phone.  The remote reefs, about 200km (120 miles) offshore from Yeppoon, a holiday and fishing town some 500km north of Queensland state capital, Brisbane, are well south of the most-visited sections of the Great Barrier Reef, where most culling efforts are focused.  But the government\u2019s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority already killed some starfish at Swains Reefs in December and will mount another mission this month, a director at the authority, Fred Nucifora, told the ABC.  \u201cThe complexity with the Swains Reef location is ... they are logistically difficult to access and it is actually quite a hostile environment to work in,\u201d Nucifora said.  There have been four major crown of thorns outbreaks since the 1960s in the Great Barrier Reef but it recovered each time because there were always healthy populations of herbivorous fish. The outbreaks are usually triggered by extra nutrients in the water but the reason for the current outbreak was unclear, Sweatman said.  The reef is still recovering from damage wrought by the worst-ever coral bleaching on record, which in 2016 killed two-thirds of a 700km stretch of reef.  On Friday a report published in the journal Science found that high ocean temperatures are harming tropical corals much more often than a generation ago, putting reefs under pressure.  The Great Barrier Reef, covering 348,000 square kilometers, was world heritage listed in 1981 as the most extensive and spectacular coral reef ecosystem on the planet, according to the UNESCO website.

          "body": "TORONTO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A small Canadian stock exchange said on Friday it has asked marijuana companies to provide details on risks they face from any U.S. operations in the wake of a Trump administration move to boost enforcement of anti-cannabis laws.  The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday rescinded an Obama-era policy that had eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states that have legalized the drug, instead giving federal prosecutors wide latitude on pursuing criminal charges.  \u201cIn light of yesterday\u2019s announcement there are certainly some disclosure issues that companies should address,\u201d Canadian Securities Exchange Chief Executive Richard Carleton told Reuters via telephone.  The exchange has contacted 17 cannabis companies with U.S. exposure whose shares it lists, asking for public statements on how the policy announced by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions could impact their businesses, Carleton said.  Those companies include CannaRoyalty Corp and Liberty Health Sciences Inc, he said.  The move follows an October notice from Canadian securities regulators that U.S.-linked marijuana companies must clearly warn investors about the risks, given the federal ban on marijuana production and sales.  Dozens of marijuana companies have gone public over the past few years in Canada, helping them finance expansion in the existing medical cannabis market and prepare to enter the nation\u2019s recreational market, which is slated to open up in mid 2018.  Marijuana stocks have posted strong gains over the past year, making the group one of the hottest sectors in the Canadian stock market.  CannaRoyalty was one of the first CSE-listed firms to comment on the impact of the new U.S. policy.  \u201cWe do not foresee the memorandum meaningfully impacting the way that existing cannabis business is conducted within legal states,\u201d CannaRoyalty CEO Marc Lustig said in a statement.  Carleton said he expects all firms to respond within days.  The others are: Alternate Health Corp, MPX Bioceutical Corp, Nutritional High International Inc , Golden Leaf Holdings Ltd, iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc, Marapharm Ventures Inc, Friday Night Inc, Vodis Pharmaceuticals Inc, International Cannabrands Inc, CannTrust Holdings Inc , NanoSphere Health Sciences Inc, Body and Mind Inc, High Hampton Holdings Corp, Wildflower Marijuana Inc, and Tinley Beverage Company Inc.  Some 60 marijuana companies have listed on the CSE, choosing it over TMX Group Ltd\u2019s larger Toronto Stock Exchange. TMX said in October that it might delist pot stocks with U.S. ties.  TMX told Reuters via email on Thursday that its guidance on the matter from October stands. (Additional reporting by Nichola Saminather; Editing by Jim Finkle and Lisa Shumaker)"

          "title": "DHS election unit has no plans for probing voter fraud: sources",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s election security unit has no immediate plans to probe allegations of electoral fraud, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement this week he was giving the issue to the agency, according to administration officials.  Trump said on Wednesday that he had asked the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review voter fraud and determine appropriate courses of action, as he announced he was disbanding a presidential commission dedicated to the matter.     Multiple officials and sources familiar with the matter said they were unaware of plans within DHS, a sprawling agency responsible for a wide array of national security issues, to investigate voter fraud.   State and federal officials said that having DHS pursue voter fraud allegations would undermine efforts to protect voting systems from cyber attacks, a current DHS priority.  Asked whether the DHS has immediate plans to pursue voter fraud issues, agency spokesman Tyler Houlton said it \u201ccontinues to work in support of state governments who are responsible for administering elections, with efforts focused on securing elections against those who seek to undermine the election system or its integrity.\u201d  Trump has said repeatedly, without providing evidence, that fraud may have accounted for his loss by nearly 3 million votes in the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Trump, a Republican, won the state-by-state electoral college vote which decides the winner of U.S. presidential elections.    Any further delay in investigating voter fraud is likely to further weaken Trump\u2019s allegations. But investigating voter fraud might complicate efforts by DHS to help states prevent cyber attacks on the 2018 midterm elections.   The commission, which Democrats and voting rights experts have attacked as meritless, was established in May last year but its work stalled when many states refused its request for data about registered voters.  Given almost no advance notice, DHS officials scrambled on Wednesday night to inform stakeholders that Trump\u2019s mandate would not interfere with efforts to help state and local election officials bolster their voting infrastructure against potential cyber attacks, according to a senior U.S. official.   The order to investigate claims of voter fraud might damage cooperation with states on cyber security, which officials see as a threat heading into the midterms in November.   States have been increasingly eager to work with the Trump administration on cyber issues but many have criticized the voter fraud initiative, saying it is groundless and distracts from legitimate issues, like hacking threats.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u201cIf (DHS) were to start investigating these non-existent voter fraud claims, that would be very problematic,\u201d said Edgardo Cortes, Virginia\u2019s chief election official, who rejected the commission\u2019s request last year for data about voters registered in Virginia. Cortes said he would also turn down DHS if it asked for the same data.   White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Thursday that the Trump administration was sending \u201cpreliminary findings\u201d to DHS, which would \u201cmake determinations on the best way forward from that point.\u201d  DHS spokesman Houlton added that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a former co-chairman of the White House\u2019s now-disbanded election integrity commission, was not advising DHS.   Kobach told news media this week that he expected officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch within DHS, to continue the work of the commission. Kobach\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0       Reporting by Dustin Volz and Julia Harte; Editing by Alistair Bell"

          "title": "Smokers more likely to need spinal surgery",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - Smoking increases the risk of lower back pain that needs to be fixed by spinal surgery, a Swedish study suggests.  Researchers focused on a common cause of lower back pain known as lumbar spinal stenosis, which occurs when the spinal canal narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. The condition often develops as people age, but nicotine\u2019s constriction of blood flow and promotion of inflammation are believed to contribute to the process, the study authors write.  The researchers examined data on 331,941 construction workers who were part of a nationwide occupational health registry in Sweden. Workers were followed for an average of more than three decades, starting when they were typically in their 30s, and 1,623 of them eventually had surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis.   Compared to people who never smoked, heavy smokers who went through at least 15 cigarettes a day were 46 percent more likely to have this spinal surgery, the study found. For moderate smokers who had up to 14 cigarettes a day, the increased risk was 31 percent, while ex-smokers had 13 percent higher odds of surgery.  \u201cSmoking appears to be a risk factor for developing lower spine space narrowing that can lead to surgical treatment,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Arkan Sayed-Noor, a researcher at Umea University.   \u201cQuitting smoking can reduce the risk,\u201d Sayed-Noor said by email.  While some previous research has linked smoking to worse outcomes from spinal surgery, the current study offers fresh evidence that it can also increase the odds that back pain will require surgery, Sayed-Noor added.  Overall, 44 percent of the study participants were non-smokers. Another 16 percent were former smokers, while 26 percent were moderate smokers and 14 percent were heavy smokers.  The connection between smoking and spinal surgery persisted even after researchers accounted for other factors that can increase the odds of lower back pain such as aging and obesity.   Smoking damages the spine in several ways, researchers note in The Spine Journal. Nicotine can damage spinal tissue, weaken bones and make back pain worse.  Heavy smoking is also often accompanied by a sedentary lifestyle that may lead to muscle weakness and increase strain on the lower back.  One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on exercise habits, the authors note. Most of the construction workers in the study were men, and the results might be different for women.  Still, the findings add to evidence linking cigarettes to disc damage and back pain, said Dr. Jean Wong, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   \u201cThere are multiple short and long-term health reasons for smokers to quit, and by quitting smoking, smokers can reduce their risk of back pain due to disc degeneration and spinal stenosis -  which can be a debilitating problem in smokers,\u201d Wong said by email. \u201cAlthough it may take multiple attempts, quitting smoking is the best thing a smoker can do to minimize the risk of spinal stenosis and other health problems.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2CXnjDL The Spine Journal, online December 12, 2017."

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron told Turkey\u2019s Tayyip Erdogan on Friday that democratic countries must respect the rule of law in their fight against terrorism as he voiced concerns about the fate of students, teachers and journalists detained by Ankara.  Macron also said after his talks with the Turkish president at the Elysee presidential palace that they had disagreed about human rights.  \u201cOur democracies must be strong standing up to terrorism... But at the same time our democracies must completely protect the rule of law,\u201d Macron said in a joint news conference.  Macron said that recent developments in Turkey did not allow for progress in Ankara\u2019s decades-long push to join the European Union.  Discussions should change focus, he said, mentioning the possibility of a \u201cpartnership\u201d that would fall short of full membership.  The EU has expressed concern over Turkey\u2019s crackdown on suspected supporters of an abortive 2016 coup that has seen some 50,000 people arrested pending trial and 150,000, including teachers, journalists and judges, sacked or suspended from their jobs.  Macron said he had raised with Erdogan the cases of specific journalists and members of Galatasaray University who had been detained, but declined to give details.  Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 15 years, defended the crackdown, saying that some journalists encouraged terrorism with their writing, comparing them to gardeners nurturing plants.    \u201cThese gardeners are those people viewed as thinkers. They water ... from their newspaper columns,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cAnd one day, you find, these people show up as a terrorist in front of you.\u201d  Even before the coup and the subsequent crackdown, France has long been skeptical about admitting Turkey, a large, relatively poor and overwhelmingly Muslim nation with a population of around 80 million people, into the EU.  Erdogan was visibly irritated when a French journalist suggested that Turkish intelligence had sent arms to Syria.  Erdogan said the operation had been conducted by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Muslim cleric blamed by Turkish authorities for orchestrating the failed coup, and accused the French journalist of speaking like one of them.  Several deals were signed during Erdogan\u2019s visit, including a tentative accord for Turkish Airlines to buy 25 A350-900 aircraft.

          "title": "Amid icy temperatures, some of Washington's homeless prefer to sleep rough",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On a broad sidewalk blocks away from the White House, Tom and Seven are getting ready for another night of sleeping in the street in frigid temperatures that have gripped the U.S. capital.   Mounds of blankets, mats and pillows have appeared on sidewalks and in urban alcoves, the last-ditch infrastructure of a population that is not sure where else to go this winter amid    the coldest temperatures in more than a decade.  Tom and Seven, who declined to give their surnames, said even though they could go to a city shelter to find a bed for the night, they rather brave the cold than sleep somewhere they fear might be unsanitary and unfamiliar.  City officials regularly try to get the two middle-aged men and their half-dozen companions huddled in blankets into a shelter as weather forecasters predict wind chills as low as -10 F (-23\u00b0C) this weekend.  Seven said he is waiting to get a voucher to access subsidized housing, which he expects to come through within a month.   \u201cBut I need that now. It\u2019s cold now!\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cIf you want to come back and bring some coats and blankets, we\u2019ll be here,\u201d Tom said.  City officials were unavailable for comment.  Washington has the highest homelessness rate in the United States, according to a 2016 survey from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, an umbrella group. At 124 people per 10,000, the city\u2019s homelessness rate is more than double the national average.  While homelessness across the country has declined, in Washington it has risen sharply.  According to several metrics, it has been growing more than almost anywhere else in the country and was up over 14 percent in 2015-16 and by 34 percent since 2009, the Conference of Mayors said.  The city has a plan to \u201caggressively\u201d end homelessness, as part of which Mayor Muriel Bowser pledged in November to place 400 homeless residents in permanent housing by mid-January.  An online counter noted that by Wednesday 265 families and 89 individuals had been housed.  With an eye on the weather, Washington also has had emergency measures in place since mid-December, opening additional shelter options and sending teams out onto the streets to offer care and urge people indoors.   But the cold remains a \u201csignificant concern\u201d, said Scott McNeilly, staff attorney with the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, pointing to media reports on Wednesday that at least one homeless person may have died of hypothermia during the latest cold snap.  \u201cThere are always some people who are reluctant to go to shelter, often for very legitimate reasons,\u201d he said, noting for instance that homeless people often have to decide whether to leave their belongings to go to city shelters.  While individuals can show up at a shelter and expect to get a bed for the night, families are required to apply through a centralized intake system.   They also have to prove their D.C. residency and that they have no other safe place to stay, both of which can be difficult, McNeilly said.  Recreation centers have been opened as shelters on an emergency basis at night but they are not open to the homeless during the day, McNeilly noted.   While the current cold snap has prompted immediate action by the city, advocates say Washington\u2019s high rate of homelessness is due to a lack of affordable housing.  The median monthly rent is more than $1,300, according to data cited by the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, a think tank.  In a 2016 report, the institute warned of the \u201cvirtual disappearance of low-cost housing in DC\u201d and said the scale of the problem was enormous.  Some 26,000 households are spending more than half of their income in rent, the report said, affecting some 20 percent of the city\u2019s children.  Under such circumstances, those households are just a single incident - like sickness or losing a job - away from homelessness.  New research also points to a corresponding phenomenon quickly remaking the face of homelessness in the United States - the rise of the \u201ctent city\u201d.  These permanent and semi-permanent encampments are set up by homeless people, mostly without the authorities\u2019 permission.  Tent cities exist in every state of the country and the District of Columbia, and have grown by 1,300 percent over the past decade, according to findings released last month by the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty.  The estimate comes from a search of media accounts and is probably a vast undercount, said Eric Tars, a senior attorney with the center.  Nearly a fifth of the encampments studied included more than 100 residents. Just 4 percent of these tent cities were found to be legal.  \u201cEncampments are becoming semi-permanent features of cities,\u201d Tars said.   Nearly two-thirds of those included in the study had been in existence for more than a year, and more than a quarter had been in place for more than five years.  \u201cThis chronic shortage in affordable housing is resulting in the growth of these shanty towns on the urban peripheries of what remains the wealthiest country in the world,\u201d Tars said.  \u201cIt represents the drastic income inequality that we\u2019ve come to expect in our country,\u201d said Tars.

The Dow and S&P 500 also were set to register their strongest start to a year since 2013.  U.S. stocks this week have been adding to momentum from last year driven by a series of strong economic reports from across the globe. The passage of a major U.S. tax overhaul last month helped to fuel late-year gains, and the S&P 500 ended 2017 up 19.4 percent.  \u201cWe\u2019re up over 2 percent for the first four days of 2018 so that\u2019s pretty good. Markets are still working to figure out the implications of tax cuts, and that\u2019s provided some of the lift along with already good economic forecasts,\u201d said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank Private Client Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.  The weak December U.S. jobs data also could help the Federal Reserve stick to its policy of gradual interest rate hikes in 2018, which would be good for stocks, he said.  U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in December amid a decline in retail employment, but a pickup in monthly wage gains pointed to labor market strength.  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 190,000.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 139.75 points, or 0.56 percent, to 25,214.88, the S&P 500 gained 12.24 points, or 0.45 percent, to 2,736.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.38 points, or 0.63 percent, to 7,122.30.  The S&P technology index\u2019s 1-percent gain led the advancers among the 11 major S&P sectors.  Gains in Microsoft, Apple and Google-parent Alphabet boosted the index.  Energy index declined 0.3 percent as oil prices pulled away from their 2015 highs on soaring U.S. production.  Francesca\u2019s Holdings tanked 20.3 percent. The women\u2019s apparel and accessories maker said it expected up to 17 percent decline in current-quarter same-store sales.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Powell, 64, who joined the Fed in mid-2012, said little on the quantitative easing program publicly at the time, and the transcripts offer a look at the contrast between his lukewarm embrace of the stimulus and the full-throated support from Janet Yellen, who at the time was No. 2 on the Fed Board.

Even over his first six months on the job in 2012, his views of the economic outlook appear to have evolved.

          "body": "CHICAGO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Exchange operator CME Group Inc will allow a type of privately negotiated transaction in all its agricultural markets for the first time on Monday, splitting traders who predict the move will either improve or hurt transparency.  CME Group, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will expand the use of transactions called block trades in its grain and livestock futures and options, such as corn and soybeans. The trades are already permitted in other markets ranging from Black Sea wheat to Eurodollars.  Block trades are large, privately negotiated deals that are struck away from the broader market by phone or otherwise and cleared by the exchange. They must exceed exchange-set size limits and be reported publicly after completion.  The transactions help traders execute large-lot orders at a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d single price and avoid disrupting prices in markets with lower liquidity, such as deferred-contract months, according to CME Group.  The company has lost liquidity in deferred futures spreads as the rise of computerized algorithmic trading has driven more activity to front-month contracts, said Gary Sandlund, president of brokerage Futures International.  \u201cThe exchange is doing a very good thing here in attempting to try to bring that back into the exchange and create a bit more transparency on some of these back-end spreads,\u201d he said.  The expansion of block trading is the latest evolution of the agricultural markets, which trace their origins to grain merchants who formed the CBOT in 1848. The closure of open-outcry futures pits, in which traders shouted out orders to buy and sell contracts, marked the end of an era in 2015, after most transactions went online.  CME Group held calls with agricultural traders to gauge support for block trades, according to a letter it sent to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The transactions should account for a small percentage of overall trading and not reduce liquidity, the letter said.  \u201cAn overwhelming majority of market participants are in favor,\u201d CME Group said.  However, the National Grain and Feed Association told CME Group and the CFTC in letters that the change threatens transparency by removing business from the public marketplace. The association represents more than 1,000 companies that handle over 70 percent of U.S. grain and oilseed harvests.  \u201cIt is our opinion that when large trades in deferred months are negotiated between parties \u2018off exchange\u2019 that price discovery is very likely compromised,\u201d the association told CME Group.

          "title": "Author of Trump book contradicts president, says aides see him as a 'child'",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The author of a deeply critical book about Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office said on Friday he had spoken with the president while working on it, contradicting Trump\u2019s assertion that he had never talked to the writer for the book and had not authorized any access to the White House.  Michael Wolff\u2019s book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d was an instant bestseller on Friday, its release pulled forward after published excerpts this week set off a political firestorm, threats by Trump lawyers of legal action and an effort to halt publication.  The book, dismissed by Trump as full of lies, depicts a chaotic White House, a president who was ill-prepared to win the office in 2016, and Trump aides who scorned his abilities.  Standing by his reporting, Wolff told NBC on Friday that Trump aides had all told him they viewed him as child-like.   \u201cI absolutely spoke to the president. Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don\u2019t know, but it was certainly not off the record,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program. Wolff added that he had spoken to people who spoke to Trump on a daily, \u201csometimes minute by minute\u201d basis.  Asked to clarify what he meant when he wrote that Trump\u2019s entire circle questioned his fitness for office, Wolff said, \u201c100 percent of the people around him ... They all say he is like a child.\u201d  On Thursday evening, Trump tweeted, \u201cI authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book.\u201d  \u201cFull of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don\u2019t exist,\u201d Trump added.  The early excerpts have also caused a public rift between the president and his former chief strategist and top campaign aide, Steve Bannon, over Bannon\u2019s comments in the book about Trump and his family.  BEST-SELLER ON DAY ONE  Lawyers for Trump had called on the book\u2019s publisher, Henry Holt & Co, to halt the book\u2019s release, originally scheduled for Tuesday. Instead, it began sales early and on Friday, its first day in stores, \u201cFire and Fury\u201d was the top-selling book on Amazon.com.  In Washington, customers lined up in bitterly cold weather to purchase a copy at KramerBooks, which began selling copies at midnight. Many Washington-area bookstores, including KramerBooks, reported selling out of copies as of Friday morning at 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT).   Justin Bethel, manager of the Politics and Prose bookstore, said its 30 copies sold out quickly. \u201cIt got so we couldn\u2019t answer the phone, it was ringing so much,\u201d he said.  Politics and Prose customer Daniel Zhang, 22, said he and his housemate read a chapter online on Thursday night and he planned to read the book later on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m going to finish work, and then I\u2019m not going out tonight; I\u2019m just going to go back and read this book,\u201d said Zhang.  The reaction was less frenetic in New York, Trump\u2019s old home base. Book Culture, an independent book seller in the Upper West Side neighborhood, said on Friday morning four people had bought the book and it had about 160 copies available, with 150 copies available in its other store.  The White House has said the book is riddled with errors, and campaign and administration officials have disputed events depicted in the book.   Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, who has called the book trash, said again on Friday that Wolff had talked only briefly to the president and did not have wide access.   \u201cThis is a guy who made up a lot of stories to try to sell books,\u201d Sanders said in an interview on Fox News Channel.  In a tweet on Friday, Trump called the book another attempt to smear him since any collusion between his election campaign and Russia \u201cis proving to be a total hoax.\u201d   Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating possible collusion as part of a broader probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He has not announced any conclusions.  \u201cThe Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable,\u201d Trump wrote.   Charles Harder, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, in a legal notice provided to Reuters, warned on Thursday of possible claims including libel against Wolff and Henry Holt & Co and threatened to try to block publication of the book. Harder also told Reuters that \u201clegal action is imminent\u201d against Bannon.  Bannon\u2019s reaction to the controversy has been muted. In interviews after the news broke with the conservative Breitbart News website, he called Trump a \u201cgreat man\u201d and pledged continued support for the president\u2019s agenda.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in December amid a decline in retail employment, but a pick-up in monthly wage gains pointed to labor market strength that could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in March.  Nonfarm payrolls rose by 148,000 last month after a surge of 252,000 in November, the Labor Department said on Friday. Retail payrolls fell by 20,300 in December, the largest drop since March, despite reports of a strong holiday shopping season.   The unemployment rate was unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 190,000 in December. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.  \u201cWe do not think that today\u2019s employment report will keep the Federal Reserve from tightening again at the March policy meeting, given other strong recent economic data,\u201d said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.  Job growth surged in October and November after being held back in September by back-to-back hurricanes, which destroyed infrastructure and homes and temporarily dislocated some workers in Texas and Florida.   Taking the sting out of the moderation in job gains, average hourly earnings rose 9 cents, or 0.3 percent, in December after a 0.1 percent gain in the prior month. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 2.5 percent, from 2.4 percent in November.  Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell on the employment report while the dollar .DXY rose marginally against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.   Employment gains in December were below the monthly average of 204,000 over the past three months. Job growth is slowing as the labor market nears full employment, but could get a temporary boost from a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.   The lift from the fiscal stimulus, which includes a sharp reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, is likely to be modest as the stimulus is occurring with the economy operating almost at capacity. There are also concerns the economy could overheat.  Data ranging from housing to manufacturing and consumer spending have suggested solid economic growth in the fourth quarter, despite a widening of the trade deficit in both October and November, which could subtract from gross domestic product.  In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said the trade gap widened 3.2 percent in November to $50.5 billion, the highest level since January 2012.  The deficit was boosted by record high imports, which offset the highest exports in three years. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the third quarter.  For all of 2017, the economy created 2.1 million jobs, below the 2.2 million added in 2016. It was the seventh year in a row that the economy generated more than 2 million jobs.       Economists expect job growth this year to slow to well below the 2017 monthly average of 170,000 as the labor market hits full employment, which will likely boost wage growth as employers compete for workers.   \u201cAlmost every person ready, able and willing to work now has a job,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPM Asset Management in New York. \u201cMeeting the labor demand of 2018 will require hiring those less willing, and enticing them into the labor market will probably require stronger wage growth.\u201d  Economists are optimistic that annual wage growth will top 3.0 percent by the end of this year. The unemployment rate declined by seven-tenths of a percentage point last year.   The jobless rate for African-Americans fell to a record low of 6.8 percent in December.   Economists believe the overall unemployment rate could drop to 3.5 percent by the end of this year, which would be the lowest since the late 1960s. That could potentially unleash a faster pace of wage growth and translate into a much stronger increase in inflation than currently anticipated.   That, according to economists, would force the Fed to push through four interest rate increases this year instead of the three it has penciled in. The U.S. central bank raised borrowing costs three times in 2017.      Employment gains were largely broad-based in December. Construction payrolls increased by 30,000 jobs, the most since February, reflecting recent strong increases in homebuilding.  Manufacturing employment increased by 25,000 jobs.   Manufacturing is being supported by a strengthening global economy and a weakening dollar. Employment in the utilities sector fell for a second straight month.   General merchandise stores payrolls tumbled by 27,300 in December, with employment at clothing stores dropping by 3,800 jobs. For all of 2017, retail employment dropped by 67,000 jobs after rising by 203,000 in 2016.     Further job losses are likely this year as major retailers, facing stiff competition from online sellers like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), close stores.  Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) said on Thursday it was shuttering 103 unprofitable Kmart and Sears stores. Macys Inc (M.N) also announced 11 store closures, which could leave 5,000 workers unemployed.  \u201cEmployment in retail trade is now the lowest it has been in almost 50 years as a percentage of total employment, and there is nothing to suggest that trend will reverse,\u201d said Eric Winograd, a senior economist at AllianceBernstein in New York.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - While many athletes dream of competing at successive Winter Olympics, American freestyle skier McRae Williams knows that at the age of 27, next month\u2019s Games in Pyeongchang could be his first and last shot at Olympic glory.  In a sport where even teenagers can dominate, Williams\u2019 breakout year did not come until he was 24 when he won the men\u2019s ski slopestyle competition at the 2013 X Games in Tignes, France.   Since then, he has added two podium finishes and appears to have peaked at just the right time heading into an Olympic season.  The previous Winter Games in Sochi came too early in Williams\u2019 blossoming career. But whether he is successful or not in getting to South Korea, the Utah resident says he has already achieved everything he ever dreamed of growing up by competing and winning medals at the X Games.  Speaking at Team USA\u2019s training camp in Austria, Williams did say, however, that he was determined to make the most of what may be his only opportunity of adding an Olympic medal to his collection.   \u201cI didn\u2019t make it in 2014 so it is a big deal and I am 27 so this might be my last shot at it so I am going to give it my all,\u201d said Williams whilst relaxing on a slack line outside the team\u2019s hotel.  He added: \u201cAt 27 I am getting nervous. I am getting older and seeing the end of my career a little bit and starting to think about what is next and I can\u2019t imagine doing anything else. I have been doing this for so long.\u201d  Williams, who resides in Salt Lake City - the venue of the 2002 Winter Games - insists that he will be happy as long as he performs to his maximum capability.   He also plans to showcase a new trick, details of which he refused to disclose.   \u201cIf it is something you have been working hard at and you have a particular trick you have been working on for a slopestyle run or in Big Air or whatever, just to land that under the pressure is an achievement in itself, personally,\u201d he  said.  \u201cObviously winning feels good too but, if you ski your best and have a good time out there then that is a win for everybody.\u201d  Pyeongchang may be the pinnacle for Williams in his career, yet even though he cast doubt on being involved in the next Games scheduled to take place in Beijing in 2022, he will not be shelving his skis anytime soon.   Williams will be found with his friends, shredding powder in the Utah backcountry.  \u201cI will probably end up going back to school one of these days and doing the real life thing,\u201d said Williams. \u201cBut I am going to live this out as long as I can.\u201d  There remain two U.S. qualifying events this month for Williams to either collect enough ranking points or impress the judges sufficiently to book his place in South Korea.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Models will strut their stuff on catwalks when London\u2019s menswear fashion week gets under way on Saturday, but absent will be some big industry names who have chosen to skip the event, or make digital presentations in place of runway shows.  The event will see around 50 traditional catwalk shows over three days, with the remainder of the 80 designers on the bill showcasing their wares through a variety of other events, including digitally.  The transition to new methods of connecting with buyers has cost the event some of its biggest catwalk names. Punk icon Vivienne Westwood announced last month that she would eschew a runway show and showcase her collection via an audio-visual presentation.  Other big Brands, including Britain\u2019s Burberry and J.W. Anderson, decided to skip the event last year and this year respectively, in favor of holding \u2018co-ed\u2019 shows during London\u2019s fashion week for womenswear in February.  \u201cAll we\u2019re trying to do is shorten the distance from a consumer to a pair of trousers,\u201d said London Fashion Week Men\u2019s Chairman Dylan Jones, who is also the editor of British GQ magazine.  \u201cIf a brand or a designer deems that it\u2019s much better for them to do a joint show, a show out of season, a digital show, go direct to consumer \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all about amplifying British creativity and selling.\u201d  Designers have been placing more emphasis on their digital presence in recent years, courting social media influencers with the same assiduousness that they traditionally reserved for the fashion press.  Online sales are a particularly important revenue stream in Britain\u2019s over 14 billion pound ($19 billion) menswear industry, growing by over 17 percent between 2010 and 2015 - outpacing all other categories in the sector - according to researchers IbisWorld.  With a shortage of big names on the catwalk this year, organizers said the event was returning to how it was originally envisioned - as a platform for young British talent.  \u201cInternational media and retailers come to London for this excitement, these new businesses, the ones that are setting the menswear world on fire and you can only get that in London,\u201d said British Fashion Council Chief Executive Caroline Rush.  It was a sentiment echoed by Jones, who saw the changes in the industry as a source of excitement.  \u201cIt\u2019s mutating and developing and changing each season. And that\u2019s the great thing about fashion \u2013 it keeps changing.\u201d  Reporting by Mark Hanrahan and Pedro Caiado; Writing by Mark Hanrahan; editing by Ralph Boulton"

The declaration will bolster the country\u2019s prospects to export meat to new markets, the statement said.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - (This January 4 story has been refiled to remove reference to the Model Cities Program in the fifth paragraph, because this was not the program Drew Gilpin Faust worked for at the time.)  Historians study the beginnings of things, even their first work experiences. For the latest in Reuters\u2019 \u201cFirst Jobs\u201d series, we talked to a few prominent historians about their introductions to employment.  Drew Gilpin Faust  President, Harvard University; author, \u201cThis Republic of Suffering\u201d  First job: HUD intern  I grew up in Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah Valley. My first full-time job, after graduating from college, was working for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Philadelphia.  This was back in 1968, so it turned out to be a pivotal time in the American experience. They had us go around to communities in states like Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland, talking to people about all the issues they faced. It was a real introduction to urban life for a girl who had grown up on a farm surrounded by horses, sheep, cows and pigs.  Mary Frances Berry  History Professor, University of Pennsylvania; author, \u201cFive Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich\u201d  First job: babysitter  When I was 11 or 12 I had a job taking care of a toddler in Nashville during the summer. One day, I saw phonograph records on the shelf, so I took some down and played them. One of them I really liked \u2013 I think it was Beethoven\u2019s symphonies. When the mother came home and I told her I really enjoyed her music, she got mad at me, because she hadn\u2019t told me I could touch them.  I didn\u2019t say anything to my mother, because I didn\u2019t know what she would think. But when I told one of my favorite aunts what had happened, she told me to stay out of white people\u2019s things, because they would think I was a troublemaker.  What I learned about myself that day, is that I have always been very curious about things \u2013 even things I am not supposed to know about. I like to ask questions, and find out stuff that other people think is not my business. Over my career, I ended up going to lots of places I wasn\u2019t supposed to go, and asking questions I wasn\u2019t supposed to ask. And now, every time I listen to Beethoven, I think about that story.  Niall Ferguson  Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution; author, \u201cThe Square and the Tower\u201d  First job: Bartender  My working life started - and ended - in a Hell\u2019s Angels pub in the town of Ayr, in the west of Scotland. The name of the pub was Rabbie\u2019s, in honor of the poet Robert Burns, Ayr\u2019s most famous son.  There was little that was poetic about the denizens of Rabbie\u2019s. They would get off their motorbikes, lumber up to the bar and mutter unintelligible things like: \u201cPintofheavyandafamousgrouse,\u201d which meant they wanted a pint of McEwan\u2019s Export and a glass of a popular blended Scotch whisky. I would reply \u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019 and they would lean over the bar and grab me by the testicles and say the exact same thing, only louder.  I lasted a week. Nevertheless, I had learned something important, namely that I was constitutionally unsuited to unskilled manual work. I resolved never to do it again.  When I arrived at Oxford, I encountered men whose job it was to sit in book-lined studies with oak panels and mullioned windows and read, write or talk about history. And that was for roughly half the year. The rest of their time was their own to spend in dusty archives or in country houses, as they saw fit.  My uncle used to ask my father periodically: \u2018Has Niall got a job yet, or is he still at the college?\u2019 The answer is no, I am still at the college. And I have never been back to Rabbie\u2019s.  Editing by Beth Pinsker and Andrew Hay"

          "body": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday declared unconstitutional a Baltimore law requiring pregnancy clinics that do not offer or refer women for abortions to post signs disclosing that fact in their waiting rooms.  The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that the law violated the First Amendment free speech rights of the Greater Baltimore Center for Pregnancy Concerns, a Christian nonprofit that provides prenatal services and counsels women on abortion alternatives.  Maryland\u2019s largest city argued that its 2009 law was meant to address deceptive advertising and reduce the potential health risks from waiting too long to have an abortion.  Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, however, wrote for the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court that Baltimore\u2019s approach amounted to \u201ctoo loose a fit\u201d with those ends.  \u201cThe ordinance forces the center to utter in its own waiting room words at odds with its foundational beliefs and with the principles of those who have given their working lives to it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWithout proving the inefficacy of less restrictive alternatives, providing concrete evidence of deception, or more precisely targeting its regulation, the city cannot prevail.\u201d  Leana Wen, Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner and one of the defendants in the lawsuit, was not immediately available to comment on the city\u2019s behalf.  David Kinkopf, a lawyer for the clinic, said he was pleased that the court \u201cstrongly upheld the First Amendment rights of religious and other nonprofit charities to speak and to serve those in need in the manner their conscience dictates, without undue government interference.\u201d  Friday\u2019s decision upheld an October 2016 ruling by U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis in Baltimore.  The lawsuit is one of a handful of similar U.S. cases, and generated dozens of court submissions from abortion rights, anti-abortion and religious freedom advocates.  Ten U.S. states with Republican attorneys general supported the clinic.  In another case, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide by June whether California violates the free speech rights of private \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d opposed to abortion by requiring signs about how to obtain state-sponsored services including abortion and contraception.  California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, has said the law is meant to help inform women about their options.  The California law was upheld in October 2016 by the federal appeals court in San Francisco.  Wilkinson distinguished it by calling the disclaimer \u201cmarkedly different\u201d from Baltimore\u2019s, and saying a separate requirement that unlicensed clinics disclose their lack of licensing does not mention abortion.  The case is Greater Baltimore Center for Pregnancy Concerns Inc v Mayor and City Council of Baltimore et al, 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-2325.

Kirsten Sutton Mork, former staff director for the House Financial Services Committee, will assume the role \u201cin the coming weeks,\u201d Representative Jeb Hensarling, who chairs that panel, said in a statement. He is one of the CFPB\u2019s most vociferous critics.  The position was last filled by Leandra English, who is now the agency\u2019s deputy director. English had been a top deputy of former Director Richard Cordray, who resigned in November and contended English should take over the agency. She sued the administration in November, claiming that Cordray had legal grounds to name his successor until a full-time director was named by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.  Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump\u2019s budget director who is CFPB acting director, has vowed to move the agency away from its agenda under President Barack Obama.  The financial industry has long complained the CFPB was too aggressive in its rulewriting and enforcement, and that its single director enjoyed too much power. But consumer advocates have called it a critical safeguard for Americans.  Also on Friday, Hensarling said that Shannon McGahn would return to the Financial Services Committee to fill the staff director role. McGahn most recently was a top advisor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Richard Chang"

          "body": "(Adds analysis from S&P and LNG imports from EIA)  Jan 5 (Reuters) - Spot natural gas in the U.S. Northeast soared to all-time highs for Friday, the coldest day of an extended freeze, after a massive snowstorm battered the East Coast.  Gas futures, however, failed to follow next-day prices higher as forecasts for less cold weather later in January and record production depressed prices for the rest of 2018.  A powerful blizzard slammed the U.S. Northeast on Thursday, knocking out power for tens of thousands.  Temperatures in New York City have remained below freezing since the day after Christmas and were expected to drop to their lowest on Friday and Saturday, with the mercury reaching only 15 and 12 degrees Fahrenheit (-9 and -11 Celsius), respectively, according to AccuWeather meteorologists.  After this weekend, Northeast temperatures were expected to return to seasonal levels with highs in New York hitting a normal 38 degrees for much of next week.  Next-day gas prices in New York City NG-CG-NY-SNL reached a record $140.25 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), according to data from brokerage firm SNL going back to 1992. The prior high was $120.75 set during the polar vortex in January 2014.  Spot gas in New England soared to a record $82.75/mmBtu, according to data going back to 1995. The prior high was $77.60 in January 2014.  In 2017, next-day gas prices averaged $3.08/mmBtu in New York and $3.80/mmBtu in New England.  S&P Global estimated gas demand in New England and New York City would be about 9.1 billion cubic feet (bcf) on Friday, up from 9 bcf on Thursday. New York City\u2019s typical daily gas use at this time of year is around 4 bcf.  One bcf of gas is enough fuel for about 5 million U.S. homes.  To meet demand, New York and New England were relying on already constrained pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports.  LNG import facilities in the region were expected to deliver about 2.0 bcf of gas on Friday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a report. It noted that Repsol SA\u2019s Canaport LNG terminal in New Brunswick, Canada, received a cargo on Tuesday and that Engie SA\u2019s Everett LNG terminal in Boston might receive a cargo on Friday.  Analysts at Barclays said the lack of movement along the back of the futures curve was likely the result of a widely held belief that production growth will keep the market well supplied in 2018.  \u201cWe think the curve will soon need to play catch up,\u201d the analysts noted. The bank expects prices at the Henry Hub benchmark to average $3.19/mmBtu in 2018 versus the current futures strip for the balance of the year of $2.73.  Record gas prices caused power in New England E-NEPLMHP-IDX to rise to its highest since January 2014.  Gas prices soared because supplies in the U.S. Northeast are constrained by limited pipeline capacity.  On a normal day, pipelines can transport more than enough fuel to supply commercial and residential customers and power plants with cheap fuel.  But on the coldest winter days, when consumers use most of the gas to heat homes and businesses, little is left for power plants. That limited supply boosts prices generators have to pay for gas so they instead burn oil if they can.  In New England, about 36 percent of the region\u2019s power plants were burning oil on Friday, while only 17 percent used gas.  On average in 2016, gas accounted for 49 percent of New England\u2019s power generation, while oil accounted for just 1 percent.

Seven said he is waiting to get a voucher to access subsidized housing, which he expects to come through within a month.   \u201cBut I need that now. It\u2019s cold now!\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cIf you want to come back and bring some coats and blankets, we\u2019ll be here,\u201d Tom said.  City officials were unavailable for comment.  Washington has the highest homelessness rate in the United States, according to a 2016 survey from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, an umbrella group. At 124 people per 10,000, the city\u2019s homelessness rate is more than double the national average.  While homelessness across the country has declined, in Washington it has risen sharply.  According to several metrics, it has been growing more than almost anywhere else in the country and was up over 14 percent in 2015-16 and by 34 percent since 2009, the Conference of Mayors said.  The city has a plan to \u201caggressively\u201d end homelessness, as part of which Mayor Muriel Bowser pledged in November to place 400 homeless residents in permanent housing by mid-January.  An online counter noted that by Wednesday 265 families and 89 individuals had been housed.  With an eye on the weather, Washington also has had emergency measures in place since mid-December, opening additional shelter options and sending teams out onto the streets to offer care and urge people indoors.   But the cold remains a \u201csignificant concern\u201d, said Scott McNeilly, staff attorney with the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, pointing to media reports on Wednesday that at least one homeless person may have died of hypothermia during the latest cold snap.  \u201cThere are always some people who are reluctant to go to shelter, often for very legitimate reasons,\u201d he said, noting for instance that homeless people often have to decide whether to leave their belongings to go to city shelters.  While individuals can show up at a shelter and expect to get a bed for the night, families are required to apply through a centralized intake system.   They also have to prove their D.C. residency and that they have no other safe place to stay, both of which can be difficult, McNeilly said.  Recreation centers have been opened as shelters on an emergency basis at night but they are not open to the homeless during the day, McNeilly noted.   While the current cold snap has prompted immediate action by the city, advocates say Washington\u2019s high rate of homelessness is due to a lack of affordable housing.  The median monthly rent is more than $1,300, according to data cited by the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, a think tank.  In a 2016 report, the institute warned of the \u201cvirtual disappearance of low-cost housing in DC\u201d and said the scale of the problem was enormous.  Some 26,000 households are spending more than half of their income in rent, the report said, affecting some 20 percent of the city\u2019s children.  Under such circumstances, those households are just a single incident - like sickness or losing a job - away from homelessness.  New research also points to a corresponding phenomenon quickly remaking the face of homelessness in the United States - the rise of the \u201ctent city\u201d.  These permanent and semi-permanent encampments are set up by homeless people, mostly without the authorities\u2019 permission.  Tent cities exist in every state of the country and the District of Columbia, and have grown by 1,300 percent over the past decade, according to findings released last month by the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty.  The estimate comes from a search of media accounts and is probably a vast undercount, said Eric Tars, a senior attorney with the center.  Nearly a fifth of the encampments studied included more than 100 residents. Just 4 percent of these tent cities were found to be legal.  \u201cEncampments are becoming semi-permanent features of cities,\u201d Tars said.   Nearly two-thirds of those included in the study had been in existence for more than a year, and more than a quarter had been in place for more than five years.  \u201cThis chronic shortage in affordable housing is resulting in the growth of these shanty towns on the urban peripheries of what remains the wealthiest country in the world,\u201d Tars said.  \u201cIt represents the drastic income inequality that we\u2019ve come to expect in our country,\u201d said Tars.

          "body": "YANGON (Reuters) - Ever since Reuters Myanmar reporter Wa Lone was arrested on Dec. 12 on suspicion of violating the Official Secrets Act, friends and former colleagues have poured out their hearts and expressed hopes for his release on social media.  Wa Lone and colleague Kyaw Soe Oo, who was also arrested, had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.  Major governments, including the United States, the European Union and Canada, and top U.N. officials, are among those demanding the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.  In Myanmar, which is still in transition after almost half a century of strict military rule, speaking out in support of journalists and others who run afoul of the authorities is more the exception than the rule.  A relative of Kyaw Soe Oo, who is based in Rakhine State, where animosity between the Buddhist Rakhine community and Rohingya Muslims is intense, said his friends were reluctant to show support for him given the divisive atmosphere.   Government spokesman Zaw Htay, when asked about social media support for the pair, said such a campaign should not be done while a case was being heard in court.  \u201cDuring the trial, they need to prove they\u2019re right and they\u2019re innocent,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cThe complainant will accuse and the accused should defend. They should think about how their pressure will affect the court.\u201d   The following are some of the numerous comments about Wa Lone, who has done voluntary charity work, helping poor children.  Thiha Maung Maung, a former colleague of Wa Lone\u2019s at the People\u2019s Age journal.  \u201cHe speaks frankly, he has a very good attitude and always helps out friends.\u201d  \u201cI am very sad to see that not only the government but also some people are seeing Ko Wa Lone as a traitor,\u201d he said, using a Burmese honorific that means \u201cbrother\u201d.  \u201cKo Wa Lone loves the country. He is someone who serves for the benefit of the country in whatever role he can.\u201d   \u201cWe, friends, are waiting for the day of his release.\u201d  Wi Sara, a monk who studied English with Wa Lone.   \u201cWa Lone is someone who studies knowledge and who shares that knowledge.\u201d  \u201cAs a journalist ... he goes after information that should be known and then presents it.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t believe he tried to sell the country\u2019s secrets for\u00a0dollars, which many people are accusing him of doing. I see that he tried to share information that should be known to the people. So, I wish for Lone\u2019s release.\u201d  Ei Pwint Rhi Zan, a friend who Wa Lone did charity work with.  \u201cHe is very kind to people who are in trouble. He is someone who always wants to help and loves the truth.\u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s someone we never have to worry would do something wrong. He never treated anyone badly and he has a very good attitude. He is very kind-hearted. He is strong-minded.\u201d  San Naing, a member of the Benevolent Youth charity group which Wa Lone is involved with.  \u201cHe\u2019s a good volunteer worker, a real volunteer worker.\u201d  \u201cWe can always rely on him during our donation trips ...\u00a0 Whenever he\u2019s on the trip, we feel energized. He makes the kids happy.\u201d   Myat Nyein Aye, a former colleague of Wa Lone\u2019s at the Myanmar Times newspaper.  \u201cKo Wa Lone is always helpful to others and he loves kids a lot and wants kids to be educated.\u201d  Mindy Walker, English-language teacher:  \u201cHe was an eager kid who was hoping for a better future for himself, his family and his country.\u201d  \u201cHe brought joy everywhere he went and made everyone feel special ... Wa Lone was especially involved in making children\u2019s lives better.\u201d  \u201cAlways smiling. Always giving. Always there to help. He doesn\u2019t belong in prison. He belongs in the community telling stories ... spreading messages of peace.\u201d\u00a0  Despite the praise for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo expressed by their supporters, many\u00a0people in Myanmar have criticized the journalists.  \u201cMedia should understand that if they sell information about the country just for dollars, things become complex,\u201d wrote a Facebook user named Linn Aung, commenting on a Myanmar news report about the two journalists.  \u201cMyanmar citizens of foreign news agencies should be loyal to their country,\u201d Facebook user Pinky Shine commented in response to another Myanmar media report about the pair.

Kirsten Sutton Mork, former staff director for the House Financial Services Committee, will assume the role \u201cin the coming weeks,\u201d Representative Jeb Hensarling, who chairs that panel, said in a statement. He is one of the CFPB\u2019s most vociferous critics.  The position was last filled by Leandra English, who is now the agency\u2019s deputy director. English had been a top deputy of former Director Richard Cordray, who resigned in November and contended English should take over the agency. She sued the administration in November, claiming that Cordray had legal grounds to name his successor until a full-time director was named by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.  Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump\u2019s budget director who is CFPB acting director, has vowed to move the agency away from its agenda under President Barack Obama.  The financial industry has long complained the CFPB was too aggressive in its rulewriting and enforcement, and that its single director enjoyed too much power. But consumer advocates have called it a critical safeguard for Americans.  Also on Friday, Hensarling said that Shannon McGahn would return to the Financial Services Committee to fill the staff director role. McGahn most recently was a top advisor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Richard Chang"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rupert Murdoch can keep his New Year celebrations going. Fresh from his $52.4 billion deal with Walt Disney, the media mogul may be a major beneficiary of a new book about dysfunction in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House. The expos\u00e9 is ripping apart the alliance between the president and his erstwhile aide and Breitbart News boss Steve Bannon.  Journalist Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury\u201d is a scorcher aimed at the Oval Office. Bannon, chief strategist for all of seven months after running the tail end of Trump\u2019s election campaign, sets plenty ablaze, heavily criticizing both the president and his family.  Trump said Bannon, who returned to his job as chairman of conservative news network Breitbart last summer, had \u201clost his mind.\u201d The president\u2019s lawyers threatened to sue Wolff\u2019s publisher, which responded by moving up the release to Friday. Breitbart\u2019s board is mulling whether to oust Bannon, and the Mercer family, one of the outlet\u2019s main shareholders, has distanced itself from him.  Murdoch plays a relatively small part in this tale as a man whose approval the president craves: \u201cTrump would brag that Murdoch was always calling him; Murdoch, for his part, would complain that he couldn\u2019t get Trump off the phone,\u201d Wolff wrote.  But the repercussions of Wolff\u2019s tell-all could play into Murdoch\u2019s hands. Breitbart\u2019s influence in conservative circles has grown considerably, not least thanks to Bannon\u2019s rapport with Trump, despite its small size: Fox News brings in some $1.5 billion of profit a year, compared with just $1.5 million at Breitbart, according to the book. And Murdoch\u2019s network has been hit by a rash of sexual-harassment allegations that forced out both its architect - now-deceased Roger Ailes - and popular host Bill O\u2019Reilly.  Bannon\u2019s possible defenestration may turn the tables by hobbling Breitbart\u2019s clout. The timing couldn\u2019t be better: Murdoch is preparing to launch what executives are starting to refer to as New Fox - the mainly news-and-sports business that will be left once the deal with Disney is complete. Having his upstart rival wounded on the sidelines would make that transaction all the sweeter. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

          "body": "* World shares continue push higher  * European stocks mark best week since April  * Dollar up after U.S. jobs report  * Zinc prices highest in decade (Updates to European trading close; adds commentary)  By Stephanie Kelly  NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - World shares continued their strong start to 2018, with European stocks closing higher and Wall Street advancing, while the U.S. dollar reversed its losses against the euro after a brief dip following the U.S. jobs report.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.51 percent, reaching a fresh record high on the day.  Throughout the first week of 2018, world shares have risen and several benchmarks have broken records. With the world\u2019s largest economies all growing healthily at once and central banks moving slowly to tighten policy, investors have poured money into risk assets.  European shares scored their best week since last April on Friday, with the pan-European STOXX 600 closing up 0.93 percent and holding at a two-month high. Euro zone blue chips gained 1.09 percent on the day, notching the best performance since April.  Switzerland\u2019s blue-chip SMI hit an all-time high, rising 0.50 percent, and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 also sailed to a new record and closed up 0.37 percent.  U.S. stocks also advanced on Friday as investors looked past weaker-than-expected U.S. job gains in December and focused on signs of a pick-up in wage growth.  Non-farm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month, while economists had expected a rise of 190,000. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent, compared to 0.1 percent in November.  \u201cThe market is shrugging it off because it\u2019s not weak enough to detract the Fed from raising rates further. The modest rise in average hourly wage number should give the Fed some breathing room,\u201d said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at SIT Fixed Income Advisors LLC in Minneapolis.  Traders of U.S. short-term interest-rate futures continued to bet the Fed would raise interest rates just two times this year, heavily pricing in a March rate hike.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average last rose 107.77 points, or 0.43 percent, to 25,182.9, the S&P 500 gained 10.6 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,734.59 and the Nasdaq Composite added 46.35 points, or 0.65 percent, to 7,124.26.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.73 percent higher, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 0.89 percent.  Emerging market stocks rose 0.68 percent.  The U.S. dollar rose on Friday, after a brief dip, after investors decided the U.S. December non-farm payrolls report would not stop the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates multiple times this year.  \u201cIt was a little disappointing. The market doesn\u2019t care. The margin of error on this number is always big,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, referring to the U.S. jobs data.  \u201cWhat we\u2019d be concerned about is if we see a couple of prints below 100,000. Until then, we\u2019re okay,\u201d he added.  The dollar index last rose 0.1 percent, with the euro down 0.18 percent to $1.2045.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.35 percent at 113.17 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3569, up 0.13 percent on the day.  U.S. Treasury yields rose on optimism over new tax cuts and the rise in monthly wage gains in the jobs report.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.4781 percent, from 2.453 percent late on Thursday.  The 30-year bond last fell 20/32 in price to yield 2.816 percent, from 2.786 percent late on Thursday.  Oil prices fell with U.S. production soaring. Earlier in the week, prices climbed to highs last seen in 2015, boosted by tightening supply and political tensions in OPEC member Iran.  U.S. crude fell 0.82 percent to $61.50 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.69, down 0.56 percent on the day.  In commodities, zinc hit its highest in more than a decade as concerns over market tightness continued. Three-month zinc on the London Metal Exchange was last bid at $3,352.

          "body": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - U.S. states that will most acutely feel the sting of a new federal cap on state and local tax deductions are starting to take action, with California considering a bill to use charitable donations to soften the blow.  The California legislation, introduced on Thursday by Democratic Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, would allow residents to donate to a new state public-purpose \u201cexcellence fund\u201d and receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit in return. De Leon says taxpayers would then be able to deduct the donation from their federal taxes.  Democratic governors in New York and Connecticut have raised the possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the cap. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was developing a plan to restructure the state\u2019s payroll tax system.  California, along with other states with high income and property taxes, are scrambling to deal with the $10,000 federal deduction cap imposed by a sweeping tax bill passed by congressional Republicans and signed into law last month by President Donald Trump.  \u201cThe Republican tax plan gives corporations and hedge-fund managers a trillion-dollar tax cut and expects California taxpayers to foot the bill,\u201d de Le\u00f3n said in a statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow California residents to be the casualty of this disastrous tax scheme.\u201d  About 6 million California taxpayers, a third of the total, itemized deductions on their tax returns, claiming an average of $18,438 for state and local taxes, according to a fact sheet on the legislation.  The excellence fund would be created by the proposed legislation and exist within the state\u2019s general fund, according to de Leon\u2019s office. The bill did not provide details on how money in the fund would be used.  Because states are not registered as charities, their tax codes would have to be modified for them to be considered charitable organizations, said Joseph Callahan, a lawyer with Mackay, Caswell & Callahan in New York.  \u201cI\u2019m scratching my head at how that would work,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom (a U.S. Internal Revenue Service) perspective, it is against public policy; it is against the intention of the Congress.\u201d  An IRS spokesman on Friday declined to comment on the California bill.  The bill\u2019s fact sheet said California and other states had created tax credit programs to fund access to college and private education.  White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said the federal government might try to block attempts to circumvent the cap, Bloomberg reported on Friday.

          "body": "HOUSTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Canadian crude shipments to the United States by rail could rise more than 60 percent this year on demand by Gulf Coast refiners for the heavy crudes and the wide differential between Canadian grades and the U.S. benchmark.  The rail shipments could reach as much as 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) by year end and average some 400,000 bpd in 2019, estimated analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Last year, the shipments averaged 130,000 bpd, according to U.S. government data.  Canadian crudes have been replacing heavy oil from Venezuela and Mexico at the Gulf Coast, due to production declines in both countries.  \u201cCanadian barrels are a great fit for Gulf Coast refiners right now. It\u2019s just a matter of getting those barrels down here,\u201d said a Gulf Coast trader.  Western Canada Select for February delivery traded Thursday at $25.05 per barrel below West Texas Intermediate, the widest since December 2014. Including transportation costs of between $11 and $14 a barrel to ship the crude by rail to the Gulf Coast, it is affordable to more refiners, said analysts and traders.  \u201cBased on where the differentials are today, as an oil producer, you\u2019re incentivized to ship product by rail to the Gulf Coast,\u201d said Matt Murphy, a Tudor Pickering researcher.  The current differential is driven in part by increased supplies. Canadian crude oil production averaged 4.2 million barrels per day in 2017, according to National Energy Board estimates, up from 3.9 million bpd in 2016.  Production is expected to rise further this year as new projects like Suncor Energy\u2019s 190,000 bpd Fort Hills oil sands plant expand operations.  However, the increase in shipments will be capped by railroad operators\u2019 willingness to accept spot deliveries. Companies such as Canadian National Railway, have insisted on long-term crude-by-rail commitments before providing more rail capacity.  \u201cThere is a two or three-year window, irrespective of what happens to pipelines, that rail is going to be required to move product to market,\u201d said John Zahary, chief executive at Altex Energy, which owns five rail terminals in Canada.

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Paris Lees became the first openly transgender woman to feature in British Vogue fashion magazine on Friday, marking a step towards a \u201cmore tolerant society\u201d, said the broadcaster and model.  Lees dons a sleek, black dress designed by Yang Li and strikes a pose among a group of women ranging from politicians to online bloggers, hailed by the magazine as a new kind of suffragist.  \u201cWhen I was growing up you rarely saw trans people in the media and only then as objects of pity, ridicule or disgust,\u201d Lees told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cWe are in the middle of a global movement where trans people are asking to be treated with the same respect as everyone else in society,\u201d she said.  Inside the avant-garde magazine\u2019s February issue, Lees is profiled in a story entitled \u201cMeet the New Suffragettes,\u201d celebrating 100 years since women in Britain gained the right to vote.  Britain granted women aged over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote in 1918, but it wasn\u2019t until 1928 that all women had the same voting rights as men.  This is not the first time transgender women have featured in international fashion magazines.   In November, men\u2019s magazine Playboy had its first transgender \u2018playmate\u2019 centrefold, while in March the French edition of Vogue featured a transgender model on its cover, as did Marie Claire Spain in 2016.  The February edition of Vogue is the third by Edward Enniful, who promised to celebrate diversity when he was appointed the magazine\u2019s first black and male editor in the publication\u2019s 100-year history in April last year.  Lees, who was subjected to bullying in childhood and has faced criticism and backlash on social media, said she hoped her inclusion would offer inspiration to others.  \u201cI know that there are many trans women who are still, in our supposedly tolerant society, too scared to come out and live their lives freely,\u201d said Lees.  \u201cTo those people I would say, if and when you feel ready to come out we\u2019ll be here to support you.\u201d  Reporting by Varsha Saraogi; editing by Adela Suliman and Ros Russell.

          "title": "Roving British photo exhibition casts light on 'invisible' modern slavery",
          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A woman is strewn on a dirty mattress wrapped in a disheveled leopard print dress, wearing a short blue wig. A butcher clad in a blood-stained apron hacks into an animal carcass.  These are just two of the striking images in an exhibition entitled \u201cInvisible People\u201d launched in London on Friday by the National Crime Agency (NCA), which will travel around Britain to raise awareness of the hidden crime of modern slavery.  \u201cMost members of the public, not unreasonably, think that slavery was a crime that was abolished over 200 years ago,\u201d Will Kerr, director of vulnerabilities for the NCA, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cThere are thousands of victims of modern slavery in every town and city across the UK.\u201d  Kerr hopes the exhibition of haunting photographs mounted on illuminated cubes, will raise awareness and generate a public debate about the crime which ranges from sexual exploitation to forced manual labor and domestic servitude.  At least 13,000 people across Britain are estimated by the government to be victims of modern slavery - but police say the true figure could be in the tens of thousands with slavery operations on the rise.  Britain is viewed as being at the forefront of global efforts to tackle the crime, having passed the Modern Slavery Act in 2015.  The law introduced life sentences for traffickers, offered better protection for people at risk of being enslaved, and forced companies to check their supply chains for forced labor.   \u201cI think some of the photos are quite harrowing,\u201d said 26-year-old Lucy Allen, who passed by the outdoor exhibition in south London.  \u201cI think this kind of thing will definitely familiarize people with modern slavery and trafficking. It\u2019s something people don\u2019t know enough about.\u201d  About 40.3 million people were estimated to be living as slaves in 2016 - mostly women and girls - in forced labor and forced marriages, according to the U.N. International Labour Organization (ILO) and human rights group Walk Free Foundation.  \u201cHistorically we knew who slaves were, they wore chains and they were restricted. With modern slavery it\u2019s much more insidious - it goes under the radar,\u201d said Rory Carnegie, one of the exhibition\u2019s photographers.  For Carnegie, it was important that he portrayed some level of dignity in his portraits. Without it those being trafficked were at risk of becoming \u201cempty people\u201d, he said.  His photos also depict the commonplace, everyday nature of the crime, which thrives in plain sight.  \u201cI want people to be moved, I want some emotional response,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The NCA leads the UK law enforcement response to modern slavery and human trafficking. There are currently more than 500 live policing operations targeting the threat, it said.  The exhibition will tour cities across Britain including Glasgow, Lincoln, Bristol and Cardiff - shown in public spaces such as shopping malls and high streets to draw attention to the crime.

          "title": "Twice-weekly workouts may be best medicine for cognitive decline",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - There\u2019s little evidence that medications improve mild cognitive decline associated with aging, according to a new review of research, but doctors can recommend exercise with confidence.  Researchers reviewed 11,530 studies of so-called mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to see how many older people are affected and which interventions and lifestyle changes have been shown to improve symptoms.   MCI becomes increasingly common at older ages and is characterized by mild problems with thinking and memory that usually don\u2019t interfere with daily life or independent function. People diagnosed with MCI are more likely, however, to go on to develop Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementias than people without it.  Until now, said Ronald Petersen, the lead author of the new study and American Academy of Neurology (AAN) treatment guidelines, \u201cClinicians didn\u2019t know what to do with these people. Now that we know that it\u2019s a burgeoning condition we need to pay attention when folks come in and complain.\u201d   Petersen, who directs the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center in Rochester, Minnesota, and his coauthors  found that between ages 60 and 64, 6.7 percent of people have MCI. In the 65-69 age group, that rises to 8.4 percent, and about 10 percent at ages 70-74, nearly 15 percent at 75-79 and just over 25 percent at ages 80 to 84.  When they looked at the use of drugs, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, they found \u201cno high-quality evidence\u201d that the medications work, according to the report in the journal Neurology.  Their analysis of studies looking at the effects of physical exercise on cognition did find a benefit, though. In one study involving 86 women with MCI, 70 to 80 years old, researchers found that twice-weekly resistance training for 26 weeks was more effective than aerobic training over the same time period at increasing what\u2019s known as executive functioning. After completing the exercise regimen, the women were better able to plan, manage and organize their thoughts.   Based on their review, the authors updated a practice guideline for MCI to include, for the first time, a recommendation that people with the syndrome should exercise regularly as part of an overall approach to managing their symptoms.   \u201cThis is a rich area of study. I don\u2019t think you can say that if you exercise 150 minutes a week you can push back cognitive decline a certain number of years,\u201d Petersen said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that for sure, but . . . physical exercise might be beneficial in slowing down the rate of cognitive decline since it has been shown to cause some stabilization or improvement of cognition.\u201d   He thinks a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training is likely best for MCI patients, but the data about its long-term effectiveness remains \u201cscant.\u201d He recommends that patients with MCI try to work up a sweat by walking briskly for 50 minutes, three times a week, because it might improve blood flow to the brain or induce enzymes to break down proteins that can build up into brain plaques.  Neurology researchers are hoping to develop more specific evidence-based guidelines on how much exercise and what kind is needed to potentially delay or prevent cognitive decline based on ongoing clinical trials, he noted.   The new AAN guideline, which is endorsed by the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, also urges clinicians to discuss with their MCI patients the diagnosis, prognosis, long-term planning and the lack of evidence that drugs and dietary options, such as vitamins E and C, homocysteine-lowering B vitamins and flavonoid-containing drinks, are at all effective.   Petersen and his colleagues also analyzed five studies of brain-training interventions and found \u201cinsufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any individual cognitive intervention strategy.\u201d Nevertheless, they conclude that doctors may recommend this approach because it might improve specific cognitive skills.  \u201cContinuing to be cognitively and physically active is paramount for overall brain health,\u201d noted Dr. Neelum T. Aggarwal of the Rush Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center in Chicago, who wasn\u2019t involved in the review or guidelines.  Some cases of MCI are associated with reversible causes of cognitive impairment, including medication side effects, sleep apnea, depression and other medical conditions, so it\u2019s important for patients to visit their healthcare provider at the first sign of memory problems, he said in a phone interview.

          "body": "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Weak wage growth and possible risks in the bond market mean the Fed should slow its pace of rate hikes for now, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said on Friday, adding the central bank should probably move just twice in 2018.  Even amid low inflation most central bankers have penciled in three rate increases for the year, and Harker as recently as November said he also felt three quarter-point hikes would be appropriate.

          "title": "FBI agent describes grisly warehouse in start of body broker's trial",
          "body": "DETROIT (Reuters) - The warehouse of a Michigan man who sold donated body parts to researchers was littered with dead flies, dog bowls and human remains \u201cfrozen together in flesh-on-flesh chunks,\u201d a federal agent testified Friday.  The grisly description came during the opening day in the federal trial of businessman Arthur Rathburn, who sold or leased donated body parts, including human heads, to medical researchers for two decades.  The buying and selling of body parts for research and education is legal under U.S. law, which does not govern the industry. Current regulations only cover body parts intended for transplant, such as hearts and livers.   Rathburn, however, is charged with defrauding customers by selling them body parts infected with hepatitis and HIV, and with lying to federal agents about shipments.  During opening statements, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Neal told jurors that human remains were stored so haphazardly that Rathburn needed a crowbar to separate frozen parts. Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Leslie Larson testified that during the 2013 search of Rathburn\u2019s warehouse, officials found a filthy scene, with no running water or heat.  \u201cBody parts were out in the open, in coolers,\u201d Larson testified. \u201cSome of the freezers had heads and torsos, some had arms and legs. Many were frozen together in flesh-on-flesh chunks.\u201d   Rathburn\u2019s lawyer, James Howarth, urged the jury to focus on the documents in the case, not gruesome photographs. He said that Rathburn\u2019s ex-wife, Elizabeth, is \u201cmost responsible\u201d for any wrongdoing. She has pleaded guilty to one count of fraud and is expected to testify for the government.  \u201cThis case is so sensitive because the nature of the evidence is going to make us all cringe, make us all uneasy,\u201d Howarth told the jury. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing particularly pretty about a deceased body that has been separated into parts, but I would hope no one would have bad feelings toward Mr. Rathburn because of that.\u201d  The government\u2019s failure to stop Rathburn sooner, despite a decade of warning signs, was one in a series of stories Reuters reported last year about the largely unregulated body broker industry.  As part of the news agency\u2019s examination of the industry, a Reuters reporter was able to purchase two human heads and a cervical spine from a body broker in Tennessee. The deals were struck after just a few emails, at a cost of $900 plus shipping.  The series also profiled two Phoenix brokers - one who earned at least $12 million from the sale or use of donated body parts and another who regularly supplied Rathburn. The broker who sold Rathburn body parts, Steve Gore, pleaded guilty to defrauding customers and is expected to testify against Rathburn.   Last month, Reuters reported that federal agents discovered four preserved fetuses during the search of Rathburn\u2019s warehouse. According to government photographs obtained by the news agency, the fetuses appear to have been in their second trimester.  The fetus photographs are not cited in any court filings and it is unclear if they will be presented at trial.   Friess reported from Detroit and Shiffman reported from Washington.

Caring Voice Coalition\u2019s decision prompted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General on Friday to announce it would allow drugmakers to provide free drugs in 2018 to patients the charity had helped.  The HHS OIG had in November told the charity that it would rescind a favorable advisory opinion issued to the nonprofit that essentially gave it approval to help Medicare patients pay for drug co-payments.  The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating several drugmakers\u2019 financial support of charities that offer assistance to people seeking help with covering out-of-pocket costs.  Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the government healthcare program Medicare for people 65 and older. But companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as the charities are independent.   In December, United Therapeutics Corp agreed to pay $210 million to resolve claims it used Caring Voice Coalition as a conduit to cover Medicare patients\u2019 out-of-pocket drug costs in order to eliminate price sensitivity and to boost sales.  In a statement on Thursday announcing its 2018 policy,  Caring Voice Coalition President Greg Smiley cited the step taken by the HHS OIG in November.  \u201cWe are grateful to have been able to assist thousands of patients suffering with numerous chronic illnesses and remain committed to fulfilling our charitable mission of improving the lives of patients with chronic illnesses,\u201d Smiley said.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The red carpet is rolling out, the champagne is on ice and the statuettes are about to be handed over.   But with the cloud of sexual harassment hanging over Hollywood\u2019s annual round of self-congratulations, the Golden Globe ceremony on Sunday marks the first test of how the industry will handle live on the world\u2019s stage a scandal that has rocked show business.  \u201cThis is an issue that is center stage in Hollywood and is playing out at the award shows,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Neil, founder of awards website GoldDerby.com.  Celebrities and filmmakers who were once major players during awards season have been shunned, written out of shows or snubbed in nominations.  Women are planning to wear black on the Golden Globes red carpet to signal support of sexual harassment victims; a major talent agency has canceled its annual Golden Globes party to instead fund legal defense for victims; and the Screen Actors Guild Awards later in January will feature all female presenters.  The mood ahead of the Oscars on March 4 ranges from nervousness to eagerness to take a stand.  \u201cEveryone I have been talking to is relishing the opportunity to make this kind of visibility and attention more meaningful than simply about the glorification of a single profession,\u201d actress Michelle Williams, who is Golden Globe nominated for \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d told Reuters.  More than 30 men have accused Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct and more than 70 women have made allegations against  film producer Harvey Weinstein.  Dustin Hoffman, comedian Louis C.K. and Jeffrey Tambor are among dozens of other celebrities, politicians and businessmen who have been accused of sexual impropriety.  Reuters is unable to independently verify any of the accusations. Weinstein has denied having any non-consensual sex with anyone, Spacey apologized to one of his accusers but was erased from \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d and written out of his TV series \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d  Hoffman and Tambor have denied any wrongdoing. C.K. admitted past misconduct and his movie and TV projects have been dropped.  \u201cI always saw this awards season as a perfect little bubble where everything is magical and beautiful because it\u2019s movies. I think what we\u2019re realizing now is that it has its own issues that it has to work on,\u201d Emily Gordon, screenwriter for movie \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d told Reuters  On Sunday, all eyes will be on Golden Globes host Seth Meyers and how he navigates what is traditionally a boozy celebration and the elephant in the room.  \u201cHe\u2019s got an impossible job. He can\u2019t ignore the hot button issue in Hollywood. He\u2019s expected to lead a jokathon but it\u2019s not a laughing matter,\u201d said O\u2019Neil.  Meyers said on Thursday that he would tackle the issue.  \u201cFingers crossed we meet the right tone but that\u2019s certainly our goal,\u201d he told Reuters Television. \u201cA great thing about the Globes is that people use it as a platform, and I don\u2019t think this year will be any different.\u201d  Hollywood is also at odds with itself. Matt Damon was slammed in December for suggesting that allegations of rape and inappropriate touching should not be conflated. Talk show host James Corden was criticized for joking about Weinstein at a Beverly Hills event in October, and Rose McGowan accused Meryl Streep of remaining silent about Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior. Streep denied the accusation and called for women to unite.  \u201cThis is getting to be a whole internecine battle in Hollywood. I think they are all very nervous,\u201d said Pete Hammond, awards columnist for Deadline.com.  The Golden Globe awards for film and television will be televised live from Beverly Hills on NBC on Sunday Jan. 7, starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT (0100 GMT on Monday).

          "body": "* Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the largest U.S. East Coast refiner, cut rates due to the severe weather.  * Natural gas prices in the U.S. Northeast were at an all-time record on the back of heating demand.  * Benchmark U.S. heating oil futures were near their highest in almost three years. (Updates with more details on refining outages, other details, adds bullet points)  By Scott DiSavino and Jarrett Renshaw  NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A severe winter storm in the U.S. Northeast brought plunging temperatures on Friday, driving regional natural gas prices to all-time highs, disrupting refinery operations and causing electrical outages.  From Baltimore to Caribou, Maine, efforts were under way to clear roadways from Thursday\u2019s snowfall. Temperatures were expected to be 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit below the average for this time of year and could set records, according to the National Weather Service.  Power outages fell to 123,000 from the 235,000 knocked out by the storm over the past couple of days and were largely concentrated in Canada, with 85,100 in Nova Scotia, 16,600 in New Brunswick and 5,100 in Quebec.  Refiners in the Philadelphia region were battling severe cold that has slowed crude deliveries and forced the largest plant on the U.S. Coast to significantly cut production.  Natural gas prices in the U.S. Northeast were at an all-time record on the back of heating demand. Benchmark U.S. heating oil futures were near their highest in almost three years.  Estimated U.S. natural gas demand soared on Monday, surpassing the previous single-day record set in 2014, according to estimates from Reuters. The increase came on the back of the low temperatures, higher consumption in the electric power and industrial sectors, and greater export demand.  U.S. demand for natural gas, which is the major heating fuel in the Northeast and is also widely used by power plants, was expected to remain near record highs this week.  Next-day gas prices in New York City NG-CG-NY-SNL jumped to a record $140.25 per million British thermal units, according to data from brokerage firm SNL going back to 1992. The prior high was $120.75 set during the polar vortex in January 2014.  Spot gas in New England soared to a record $82.75 per mmBtu, according to data going back to 1995. The prior high was $77.60, also in January 2014.  In 2017, next-day gas prices averaged $3.08 per mmBtu in New York and $3.80 in New England.  The only nuclear plant in Massachusetts remained shut on Friday after halting operations on Thursday afternoon due to the failure of a line that connects the reactor to the power grid.  Entergy Corp, which operates the Pilgrim Station, said it had not identified the cause of the line problem. ISO New England, which operates the region\u2019s power grid, attributed the shutdown to blizzard conditions.  The New England grid operator said it expected the region to have sufficient generating resources to meet the peak demand of 20,450 megawatts and reserve requirements of 2,128 MW on Friday but would only have a surplus of about 500 MW if it must use all of its reserves. Pilgrim\u2019s capacity is about 688 MW.  The average U.S. home heating oil price rose 5.4 percent to $3.078 a gallon in the seven days through Jan. 1 from a week earlier, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. On the East Coast, the price increased 5.4 percent to $3.085.  Prices for the 2017-18 period are well above the 2016-17 levels, the data showed.  Next-day power prices in New England E-NEPLMHP-IDX and PJM E-PJWHRTP-IX, which covers much of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Midwest region, rose to their highest since January 2014 due to a spike for local natural gas.  There are concerns that a significant disruption could lead to a heating oil shortage as distillate inventories in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions are at their lowest levels for this time of year since 2015.  Supply worries have spurred tankers carrying diesel and heating oil to set out from Europe for the United States, reversing a traditional trade route.  Icebreakers have been used in ports of Boston, New York and Philadelphia to keep shipping lanes clear, but delays are expected, and the Coast Guard said late on Wednesday that those ships would remain at shore until the storm had passed.  Reliance on heating oil is highest in the Northeast, with about 21 percent of households using it for space heating.  Most northern U.S. refiners are not reporting significant problems, but the extreme cold still poses threats.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions has cut rates by 40 percent at its 335,000 bpd refinery complex in Philadelphia due to a winter storm slowing crude deliveries, a source familiar with the plant\u2019s operations told Reuters on Friday. It\u2019s the largest refinery on the U.S. East Coast.  The company also postponed planned work at its 335,000 barrel-per-day refinery complex in Philadelphia until after the storm.  Ridgebury Pioneer, which was carrying 1.9 million barrels of heavy crude into PBF Energy\u2019s East Coast refineries, has been delayed by the storm, according to Reuters Eikon shipping data and two sources familiar with the delivery.  VLCCs, or Very Large Crude Carriers, are uncommon in the Philadelphia region. Monroe Energy was forced to shut its plant in September when a hurricane slowed deliveries.

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Paris Lees became the first openly transgender woman to feature in British Vogue fashion magazine on Friday, marking a step towards a \u201cmore tolerant society\u201d, said the broadcaster and model.  Lees dons a sleek, black dress designed by Yang Li and strikes a pose among a group of women ranging from politicians to online bloggers, hailed by the magazine as a new kind of suffragist.  \u201cWhen I was growing up you rarely saw trans people in the media and only then as objects of pity, ridicule or disgust,\u201d Lees told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cWe are in the middle of a global movement where trans people are asking to be treated with the same respect as everyone else in society,\u201d she said.  Inside the avant-garde magazine\u2019s February issue, Lees is profiled in a story entitled \u201cMeet the New Suffragettes,\u201d celebrating 100 years since women in Britain gained the right to vote.  Britain granted women aged over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote in 1918, but it wasn\u2019t until 1928 that all women had the same voting rights as men.  This is not the first time transgender women have featured in international fashion magazines.   In November, men\u2019s magazine Playboy had its first transgender \u2018playmate\u2019 centrefold, while in March the French edition of Vogue featured a transgender model on its cover, as did Marie Claire Spain in 2016.  The February edition of Vogue is the third by Edward Enniful, who promised to celebrate diversity when he was appointed the magazine\u2019s first black and male editor in the publication\u2019s 100-year history in April last year.  Lees, who was subjected to bullying in childhood and has faced criticism and backlash on social media, said she hoped her inclusion would offer inspiration to others.  \u201cI know that there are many trans women who are still, in our supposedly tolerant society, too scared to come out and live their lives freely,\u201d said Lees.  \u201cTo those people I would say, if and when you feel ready to come out we\u2019ll be here to support you.\u201d  Reporting by Varsha Saraogi; editing by Adela Suliman and Ros Russell.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Neiman Marcus Group Ltd [NMRCUS.UL] on Friday named Geoffroy van Raemdonck, an executive at upscale clothing manufacturer Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N), to succeed Karen Katz as chief executive officer of the debt-burdened luxury retailer next month.  Katz, who has led Neiman Marcus since 2010, will retain her board seat after retiring as CEO on Feb. 12, the company said.  Van Raemdonck, 45, was Ralph Lauren\u2019s group president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa and head of travel retail. He previously was CEO at St. John Knits International Inc, where he oversaw a turnaround of the luxury apparel retailer.  Neiman Marcus had been hunting for a CEO for some time, but several top executives at other companies spurned its approaches, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing sources.   GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders said van Raemdonck\u2019s experience at St. John Knits could make Neiman Marcus more attractive to younger shoppers.  \u201cHe could be the breath of fresh air that Neiman Marcus needs,\u201d Saunders said.   \u201cThat said, the biggest challenge is managing Neiman\u2019s debt load, which is a millstone around the neck of the company,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are no easy solutions to this, and it is unlikely van Raemdonck has any tricks up his sleeve to remedy the problem.\u201d  The company is struggling with a nearly $5 billion debt load, due mainly to its 2013 leveraged buyout by Ares and Canadian public pension fund CPPIB from other private equity firms.  Like other retail chains, Neiman Marcus has also suffered as customers move away from brick-and-mortar stores in favor of online shopping.  Same-store sales rose for the first time in two years in its latest quarter, when it benefited from Katz\u2019s efforts to invest heavily in its online business.  Katz, 60, will be eligible to receive nearly $2.5 million as a lump sum following her retirement as CEO and another $1 million before March 14, 2019, Neiman Marcus said in a regulatory filing.  Van Raemdonck\u2019s annual base salary will not be less than $1 million, the company said.

          "title": "Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.  World stocks started the year with their best week in over a year and while it\u2019s tempting to say \u201csame old, same old\u201d as markets smash another host of milestones and records, you still have to take a step back and assess what\u2019s happening.   There are some who will dismiss this as another bout of mindless bubble blowing and insist it will all end in tears. Perhaps it will. But the more sober assessment is that we are going through the first boom in the world economy in over a decade.   Global industrial output raced higher at more than a 5 percent annualized rate last month and more than 4 percent for the fourth quarter as a whole. The G10 economic surprise index \u2013 which nets positive over negative hits and misses on incoming data \u2013 continues to hover close to its most positive readings in almost 8 years.   There will be harder data on industrial output for Q4 next week, as well as trade data readings from China and tech soundings in Asia from the likes of Samsung. Inflation-focused central banks that have fueled all this with their record cheap money will be looking at the rising price of oil meanwhile.  Graphic: The new year party for world markets - reut.rs/2Cwwb25  Perhaps one reason for the latest run up in stocks, the Q4 earnings season, comes back onto the radar, with the big U.S. financials kicking off at the end of the week.   JPMorgan Chase and rival Wells Fargo launch the earnings season with reports before the opening bell on Friday. Even despite the record low financial market volatility that\u2019s crimping trading revenues, deal making has been super brisk over recent months and overall fee income from banks around the world rose some 16 percent last year to a record level of more than $100 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.      The numbers should be good. Blended year-on-year Q4 earnings growth for the S&P 500 overall is expected to be 11.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates, up from 8.5 percent in Q3. Excluding the energy sector, which benefits from weak year-earlier comparisons, it is seen at 9.5 percent.      Data which runs since 1994 shows that in a typical quarter 64 percent of companies beat estimates and 21 percent miss estimates. Over the past four quarters, however, 72 percent have beaten the Street estimates and only 19 percent have missed them.  Graphic: U.S. earnings estimates - reut.rs/2Cw0XIj  Officials from North and South Korea will meet on Tuesday for their first official talks in more than two years.  Agreeing to the meeting represents a turnaround by Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, which has focused in the past 12 months on developing its nuclear arsenal amid bellicose exchanges with U.S. President Donald Trump, raising alarm across the world.   The meeting is expected to focus on the North potentially sending athletes to the Winter Olympics to be held in the South in February as well as on some other inter-Korean relations, according to Seoul.   Every word and gesture will be scrutinized by geopolitical analysts as they try to judge if this really is a re-emerging detente between the two nations, not to mention the reaction from Trump\u2019s twitter account.    Graphic: North & South Korea - Lines of communication IMG: tmsnrt.rs/2CtuIJS  A blizzard of data is expected to show China\u2019s economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note. However, activity has  remained more resilient than expected despite a crackdown on industrial pollution, overzealous lending and a cooling property market.  The week kicks off with forex reserves data and a bunch of inflation numbers, before the focus will switch to trade figures out on Friday. Exports are expected to have jumped more than 9 percent in December after soaring unexpectedly 12.3 percent in November thanks to sustained strength in global demand.  A slight pullback in December industrial growth, producer inflation and investment would all reinforce consensus views that the world\u2019s second-largest economy will slow only marginally in 2018. A more marked loss of momentum may put fears of a sharper slowdown back on the table, unsettle the yuan and possibly stall the government\u2019s push to reduce rising debt.  Graphic: China Economic Snapshot - Trade: reut.rs/2CWFqcZ  It may be the depths of winter with storms tearing across the euro zone, but the political and economic skies are almost cloudless all of a sudden.   On Sunday, Angela Merkel will begin trying to re-form a \u2018grand coalition\u2019, an effort that could rumble on for a few months, and campaigning for Italy\u2019s uncertain election in March is also getting underway, but the rest of the bloc looks buoyant.  Perhaps the most eye-catching thing is that crisis posterchild Greece\u2019s borrowing costs hit their lowest in 12 years on Friday on expectations that the country could conclude its euro zone/IMF bailout package later this year.  That would cap a slowly strengthening recovery eight years after Greece lurched on the brink of defaulting on its debt and risked being kicked out of the single currency bloc.

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron told Turkey\u2019s Tayyip Erdogan on Friday that democratic countries must respect the rule of law in their fight against terrorism as he voiced concerns about the fate of students, teachers and journalists detained by Ankara.  Macron also said after his talks with the Turkish president at the Elysee presidential palace that they had disagreed about human rights.  \u201cOur democracies must be strong standing up to terrorism... But at the same time our democracies must completely protect the rule of law,\u201d Macron said in a joint news conference.  Macron said that recent developments in Turkey did not allow for progress in Ankara\u2019s decades-long push to join the European Union.  Discussions should change focus, he said, mentioning the possibility of a \u201cpartnership\u201d that would fall short of full membership.  The EU has expressed concern over Turkey\u2019s crackdown on suspected supporters of an abortive 2016 coup that has seen some 50,000 people arrested pending trial and 150,000, including teachers, journalists and judges, sacked or suspended from their jobs.  Macron said he had raised with Erdogan the cases of specific journalists and members of Galatasaray University who had been detained, but declined to give details.  Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 15 years, defended the crackdown, saying that some journalists encouraged terrorism with their writing, comparing them to gardeners nurturing plants.    \u201cThese gardeners are those people viewed as thinkers. They water ... from their newspaper columns,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cAnd one day, you find, these people show up as a terrorist in front of you.\u201d  Even before the coup and the subsequent crackdown, France has long been skeptical about admitting Turkey, a large, relatively poor and overwhelmingly Muslim nation with a population of around 80 million people, into the EU.  Erdogan was visibly irritated when a French journalist suggested that Turkish intelligence had sent arms to Syria.  Erdogan said the operation had been conducted by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Muslim cleric blamed by Turkish authorities for orchestrating the failed coup, and accused the French journalist of speaking like one of them.  Several deals were signed during Erdogan\u2019s visit, including a tentative accord for Turkish Airlines to buy 25 A350-900 aircraft.

Any suggestion to the contrary was \u201cfake news ... absolute rubbish,\u201d he added.  The vast majority of migrants in Israel came from Eritrea and Sudan and many say they fled war and persecution as well as economic hardship, but Israel treats them as economic migrants.  Rights groups have accused Israel of being slow to process African migrants\u2019 asylum requests as a matter of policy and denying legitimate claims to the status.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Neiman Marcus Group Ltd [NMRCUS.UL] on Friday named Geoffroy van Raemdonck, an executive at upscale clothing manufacturer Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N), to succeed Karen Katz as chief executive officer of the debt-burdened luxury retailer next month.  Katz, who has led Neiman Marcus since 2010, will retain her board seat after retiring as CEO on Feb. 12, the company said.  Van Raemdonck, 45, was Ralph Lauren\u2019s group president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa and head of travel retail. He previously was CEO at St. John Knits International Inc, where he oversaw a turnaround of the luxury apparel retailer.  Neiman Marcus had been hunting for a CEO for some time, but several top executives at other companies spurned its approaches, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing sources.   GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders said van Raemdonck\u2019s experience at St. John Knits could make Neiman Marcus more attractive to younger shoppers.  \u201cHe could be the breath of fresh air that Neiman Marcus needs,\u201d Saunders said.   \u201cThat said, the biggest challenge is managing Neiman\u2019s debt load, which is a millstone around the neck of the company,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are no easy solutions to this, and it is unlikely van Raemdonck has any tricks up his sleeve to remedy the problem.\u201d  The company is struggling with a nearly $5 billion debt load, due mainly to its 2013 leveraged buyout by Ares and Canadian public pension fund CPPIB from other private equity firms.  Like other retail chains, Neiman Marcus has also suffered as customers move away from brick-and-mortar stores in favor of online shopping.  Same-store sales rose for the first time in two years in its latest quarter, when it benefited from Katz\u2019s efforts to invest heavily in its online business.  Katz, 60, will be eligible to receive nearly $2.5 million as a lump sum following her retirement as CEO and another $1 million before March 14, 2019, Neiman Marcus said in a regulatory filing.  Van Raemdonck\u2019s annual base salary will not be less than $1 million, the company said.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Veteran former U.S. talk show host David Letterman will return to television on Jan. 12 in a new Netflix show where his first guest will be former U.S. President Barack Obama, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Friday.  The company\u2019s shares rose as much as 2 percent to a record  of $209.72.  Called \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman,\u201d the six-episode series will also feature interviews with actor George Clooney, rapper Jay-Z, radio shock jock Howard Stern, comedian Tina Fey and Pakistani education activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, the streaming service said.  Netflix has been spending heavily to produce and acquire content as it races to dominate streaming television and beat competition from traditional media and other streaming players such as Hulu and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Prime Video.  Letterman\u2019s interview with Obama will mark the former president\u2019s first television talk show appearance since he left office in January last year.  Letterman, 70, left his job as host of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d in May 2015, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family after more than 30 years on late night television.  His return to television for Netflix was announced in August 2017, when the quick-witted host said that Pope Francis and President Donald Trump would be top of his wish-list for the series.  Netflix said the new series would consist of 60-minute episodes centered around \u201cone extraordinary figure whom Dave finds fascinating\u201d and that the interviews would take place  both inside and outside a studio setting.  The company, home to shows such as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d streams to most countries in the world and has a customer base of about 115.6 million.  The company\u2019s shares have kept pace with its user growth and have risen nearly 60 percent in the past one year.

          "body": "(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to text)  By Brendan Pierson  NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A nephew of former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pleaded guilty on Friday to U.S. charges that he took part in a scheme to bribe an official at a sovereign wealth fund in order to sell a building complex in Vietnam.  Joo Hyun \u201cDennis\u201d Bahn, 39, pleaded guilty to violating a U.S. foreign corruption law and to conspiracy before U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan.  Bahn admitted that in 2014 and 2015, he tried to arrange a bribe to secure the sale of Hanoi\u2019s Landmark 72 building complex, owned by Korean construction company Keangnam Enterprises Co Ltd. Bahn\u2019s father, Ban Ki-sang, was an executive at the company.  Bahn said he believed he was paying a $500,000 bribe to an official at Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund through a middleman, New York fashion designer and blogger Malcolm Harris. In reality, Bahn said, Harris had no connection with any Qatari official and kept the money.  Prosecutors have said that Bahn agreed to pay another $2 million upon closing of the sale.  \u201cI knew what I was doing was a bad act,\u201d Bahn said on Friday.  Bahn is scheduled to be sentenced on June 29. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years, though prosecutors have agreed that an appropriate sentence would be up to about seven years, according to Bahn\u2019s written plea deal.  Bahn, a South Korean citizen who lives in New Jersey and has worked as a real estate broker in Manhattan, said on Friday that he understood he would face deportation after serving his sentence.  U.S. prosecutors have also charged Ban Ki-sang, who remains at large. Prosecutors have said he enlisted his son to arrange the Landmark 72 sale to help Keangnam deal with a liquidity crisis.  Ban Ki-moon was long expected to make a bid for the presidency of South Korea, but announced in February 2017 that he would not run, decrying \u201cfake news\u201d about him and his family.  Harris pleaded guilty to money laundering and wire fraud in June, and was sentenced to three and a half years in prison in October.

          "body": "* U.S. economy adds 148,000 jobs in Dec vs est. 190,000  * Average hourly earnings rise 0.3 pct, in line with estimates  * Energy stocks fall after oil prices retreat  * Indexes up: Dow 0.34 pct, S&P 0.32 pct, Nasdaq 0.59 pct (Updates to early afternoon)  By Sruthi Shankar  Jan 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s main indexes extended their new year rally on Friday after weak December U.S. jobs data raised expectations that the Federal Reserve would stick to its policy of gradual interest rate hikes in 2018.  U.S. stocks kicked off 2018 on a strong note, carrying momentum from last year driven by a series of strong economic reports from across the globe.  The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were on track for their biggest percentage gains in more than a year on Friday, and the Dow in about a month.  U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in December amid a decline in retail employment, but a pick-up in monthly wage gains pointed to labor market strength.  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 190,000.  Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent in December, lifting the annual increase in wages to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent in November.  \u201cThe market is shrugging it off because it\u2019s not weak enough to detract the Fed from raising rates further. The modest rise in average hourly wage number should give the Fed some breathing room,\u201d said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager, SIT Fixed Income Advisors LLC, Minneapolis.  Traders of U.S. short-term interest-rate futures continued to bet the Fed would raise interest rates just two times this year, heavily pricing in a March rate hike.  At 12:39 p.m. ET (1739 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 84.64 points, or 0.34 percent, at 25,159.77 and the S&P 500 was up 8.69 points, or 0.32 percent, at 2,732.68. The Nasdaq Composite was up 41.59 points, or 0.59 percent, at 7,119.51.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than employment number that is to the weaker side (to bring the market lower),\u201d said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania.  Technology index\u2019s 0.77 percent gain led the advancers among the 11 major S&P sectors.  A more than 1 percent rise in Microsoft, Apple and Google-parent Alphabet boosted the index.  Energy index declined 0.56 percent as oil prices pulled away from their 2015 highs on soaring U.S. production.  Francesca\u2019s Holdings tanked 20 percent after the women\u2019s apparel and accessories maker said it expected up to 17 percent decline in current-quarter same-store sales.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,435 to 1,377. On the Nasdaq, 1,497 issues rose and 1,380 fell.  Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj\nKalluvila"

          "body": "PRISTINA (Reuters) - An Israeli citizen accused of involvement in a human organ trafficking scandal in Kosovo a decade ago has been arrested in Cyprus and the authorities in Pristina have requested his  extradition to face trial, police said on Friday.  Police accuse Israeli Moshe Harel of seeking out people in need of kidney transplants and of luring donors to Kosovo from Turkey and the ex-Soviet Union with the promise of up to 12,000 euros ($14,500) in payment.  Recipients, mainly Israelis, paid between 80,000 and 100,000 euros for the organs. Some donors never received any money.  \u201cBased on an international arrest warrant the suspect M.H. was arrested a few days ago in Cyprus. He has been a wanted person since 2010,\u201d police spokesman Baki Kelani told Reuters.  Russia has also issued an international arrest warrant for Harel.  Cypriot authorities were not immediately available for comment on the case.  Harel was arrested in 2012 in Israel in connection with a parallel investigation, but was not extradited to Kosovo, which has no diplomatic relations with Israel.  The organ scandal came to light in 2008 when a Turkish man was stopped at Pristina airport, visibly in pain having had his kidney removed. The trafficking ring acted out of the Medicus clinic on a residential road on the outskirts of Pristina.   The director of the clinic, urologist Lutfi Dervishi, was sentenced to eight years in jail for organized crime and human trafficking and his son Arban for seven years in 2013, though both men went into hiding and have not served their sentences.  In 2016 a Kosovo court ordered a retrial of doctors and officials convicted of involvement in the case and that trial is still ongoing. They have all denied any wrongdoing.  Police said Lutfi Dervishi had been recaptured last year and was among those now being retried. His son and another suspect in the case, Turkish doctor Yusuf Sonmez, are still at large.   In a separate case, attention over the trafficking allegations has grown since Council of Europe envoy Dick Marty in 2010 accused Kosovo Albanian guerrilla fighters of harvesting organs from captives, mainly Serbs, during the 1998-99 Kosovo war.  A special court with international prosecutors and judges but under Kosovo law was set up to tackle Marty\u2019s allegations but no indictments have yet been filed.

          "body": "(Reuters) - New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, head coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft have all shot down a report that suggested a rift between them could soon bring an end to their successful run.  An ESPN report published on Friday said friction amongst the three most powerful members of the Patriots franchise, who last season won their fifth Super Bowl together, could be enough to make this the final season they work together.  \u201cFor the past 18 years, the three of us have enjoyed a very good and productive working relationship,\u201d the trio said in a joint statement. \u201cIn recent days, there have been multiple media reports that have speculated theories that are unsubstantiated, highly exaggerated or flat out inaccurate.\u201d  The statement came hours after the ESPN article, which cites more than a dozen Patriots staffers, executives, players and NFL sources with knowledge of the team\u2019s inner workings, said the trio have had serious disagreements.  According to ESPN, the three men have been at odds for years over a number of issues, including Brady\u2019s trainer and business partner Alex Guerrero having some team privileges removed and the team\u2019s decision to trade backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to the San Francisco 49ers for a second-round pick.  The article went as far as to say there is a \u201cpalpable sense in the building that this might be the last year together for this group.\u201d  The Patriots, who are favorites to repeat as Super Bowl champions this season, are the top seed in the American Football Conference playoffs and will next play in the Divisional Round on Jan. 13 against either the Kansas City Chiefs, Tennessee Titans or Buffalo Bills.  \u201cThe three of us share a common goal. We look forward to the enormous challenge of competing in the postseason and the opportunity to work together in the future, just as we have for the past 18 years,\u201d the statement added.  \u201cIt is unfortunate that there is even a need for us to respond to these fallacies. As our actions have shown, we stand united.\u201d  Don Yee, who is the agent for both Brady and Garoppolo, also weighed in on the report.  \u201cI don\u2019t know really what to say \u2014 it\u2019s tough to have a response since it didn\u2019t appear to me to have one on-the-record quote,\u201d Yee said in a statement issued to the NFL Network\u2019s Tom Pelissero. \u201cAll I can suggest is don\u2019t believe everything you read.\u201d  Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Christian Radnedge"

          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week cut oil rigs for the first week in three even though crude prices hovered near their highest level since the spring of 2015.  Drillers cut 5 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 5, bringing the total count down to 742, General Electric Co\u2019s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.  In the prior two weeks, drillers did not add or remove any rigs.  The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when only 529 rigs were active. Energy companies boosted spending plans in 2017 as crude prices started recovering from a two-year crash.  The increase in U.S. drilling lasted 14 months before stalling in the second half of last year as some producers trimmed their 2017 spending plans after prices turned softer over the summer.  In 2017, U.S. crude futures averaged $50.85 a barrel, easily topping last year\u2019s $43.47 average. This week, futures traded over $62, their highest since May 2015.  Looking ahead, futures were trading at $60 for the balance of 2018 and $57 for calendar 2019.  In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 21 of the roughly 65 E&Ps they track have already provided capital expenditure guidance indicating a 13 percent increase in planned spending over 2017.  Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks would spend about $66.1 billion on drilling and completions in the lower 48 U.S. states in 2017, about 53 percent more than what they planned to spend in 2016.  Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week slightly reduced their forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count to an average of 997 in 2018 and 1,126 in 2019. Two weeks ago, it forecast 999 in 2018 and 1,127 in 2019.  There were 924 oil and natural gas rigs active on Jan. 5. On average, there were 876 rigs available for service in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.      Overall, U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.2 million barrels per day in 2017 and an all-time high of 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to a federal energy projection in December.

          "title": "Sterling trades sideways as investors look to Brexit talks for cues",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling steadied against the dollar on Friday, ending the week at much the same levels it started at, with traders keen to see new developments on Brexit negotiations before taking new positions on the British currency.   Economic data released over the week have pointed to the economy picking up at the end of last year, with businesses growing more optimistic about the year ahead. But that has had little impact on the currency.  Numbers released on Friday showing Britain\u2019s economic productivity rose at its fastest rate in more than six years in the three months to Sept. 30 - though in absolute terms still barely above its level of nearly a decade ago - did not give the pound any additional support.  BNP Paribas currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown said data released on Thursday showing British consumers increased their borrowing by the smallest amount since mid-2015 in the three months to November could spell bad news for sterling.  \u201cGiven that the decline in real spending in the UK has been smaller than the decline in real wages, consumption is vulnerable, and we should start to see that feed through into softer activity data and then eventually into a weaker pound,\u201d he said.   Sterling was trading flat on the day at $1.3563. It had hit a 3-1/2-month high of $1.3614 on Wednesday, less than half a cent away from its highest since the Brexit vote, but traders said it needed new catalysts to break any higher.   A Reuters poll of currency strategists on Friday showed the pound is expected to mostly hold steady against both a shaky dollar and the firming euro this year, but much will hinge on progress in Britain\u2019s talks with Brussels on its withdrawal from the European Union.  The strategists, who were polled in the first week of 2018, were not brimming with optimism on how the next stage of talks will go, but most do not think the pound is set for another major fall.  \u201cThe pound\u2019s ongoing resilience continues to support our view from over a year ago that a lot of bad news (has) already (been) priced in,\u201d MUFG currency analysts said.  \u201cAn important positive implication for the pound is that the risk of a more disorderly \u2018No Deal\u2019 Brexit outcome has diminished and the pound should strengthen if fears over a more disruptive and harder Brexit outcome do not materialise.\u201d  Against the euro, sterling rose by a third of a percentage point to 88.77 pence.

Former world number one Kerber made short work of Gavrilova, beating the Australian 6-1 6-2 to give Germany the upper hand.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc (STZ.N) missed Wall Street estimates for third quarter revenue on Friday and said wine and spirit sales for the full-year would be at the low end of a previous forecast, sending its shares down as much as 4 percent.  Its stock recouped some of the losses later in the day after Chief Executive Robert Sands said the company was seeing no real impact on alcohol sales from the legalization of cannabis for recreational use in six U.S. states.   The comments come two months after Constellation said it took a nearly 10 percent stake in Canada\u2019s biggest cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corp (WEED.TO), becoming the first major beer and spirits company to invest in legal cannabis.  \u201cWe really can\u2019t see any impact in terms of how it\u2019s (cannabis) affecting beverage alcohol in general and even in the 6 states, including California,\u201d Sands said on a conference call with analysts.   He also said it was too early to tell whether Constellation\u2019s investment in the Canadian company would be \u201ccannibalistic or complementary\u201d.  \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough information I think to really say how that\u2019s going to affect beverage alcohol in general going forward,\u201d Sands said.  Constellation said that the recent U.S. tax overhaul would reduce its net deferred tax liabilities by $300-$400 million, a non-cash benefit that would be reported in the current quarter.   The company also announced a $3 billion share buyback program and raised in its full-year profit forecast.   Its shares, up around 50 percent last year, were down 1.9 percent at $221.5 in afternoon trading.   Wine and spirit sales, which make up a little less than a half of Constellation\u2019s total revenue, fell 10.3 percent in the third quarter, due to hurricanes in Florida and Texas, wildfires in California and a drop in demand from retail customers.   The drop in sales also reflects the divestiture of the company\u2019s Canadian wine business in December 2016.   The company said it now expects sales of wine and spirits, which include Robert Mondavi wines and Svedka Vodka, to be at the lower end of a prior forecast that already called for a decline of 4-6 percent for the full-year.  Rationalization of lower-margin wines and spirit brands alone will cause a 1 percentage point fall, Chief Financial Officer David Klein said on the call.     Beer sales, the company\u2019s biggest business, rose 8 percent in the quarter. Depletions, or distributor shipments to retail customers, rose 9.1 percent due to the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays in the quarter.   Net income rose to $491.1 million, or $2.44 per share, in the third quarter ended Nov. 30, from $405.9 million, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier.   Excluding one-time items the company earned $2.00 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.89 per share.

          "title": "Pakistani minister decries U.S. as 'friend who always betrays'",
          "body": "ISLAMABAD/LAHORE (Reuters) - Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said the United States was behaving towards Pakistan as \u201ca friend who always betrays\u201d after Washington suspended aid and President Donald Trump accused Islamabad of lies and deceit over many years.  Opposition leader Imran Khan, a former cricket star tipped as the next prime minister, said it was time for Pakistan to \u201cdelink\u201d from the United states and run down U.S. diplomatic and intelligence presence in what is a sensitive strategic area.  Washington accuses Pakistan of playing a \u201cdouble game\u201d by assisting Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants causing chaos in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies this and accuses the United States of disrespecting its vast sacrifices - casualties have numbered in the tens of thousands - in fighting terrorism.  Anti-American sentiment and tense U.S.-Pakistan ties are  some way off their recent nadir in 2011, when Osama bin Laden was killed in a secret U.S. raid inside Pakistan, but the harsh rhetoric is likely to make it harder to mend future ties.  \u201cThe U.S. behavior is neither that of an ally nor of a friend,\u201d Asif told local Capital TV late on Thursday. \u201cIt is a friend who always betrays.\u201d  Small groups of students chanting \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Trump\u201d burnt American flags and torched photos of Trump after Friday prayers in capital Islamabad and the eastern city of Lahore. The organized protests ended swiftly.  Worsening ties may push Pakistan further into the arms of long-time ally China, which backed Islamabad after the fallout from Trump\u2019s tweet. Beijing\u2019s diplomatic and financial support has also strengthened Pakistan\u2019s hand, analysts say.  On Friday, Pakistan\u2019s foreign office criticized what it called \u201cshifting goalposts\u201d after the U.S. confirmed it would suspend all security assistance, believed to total at least $900 million, until Pakistan stopped assisting militants.  Other official government statements in response to Trump\u2019s tweet have been measured but Foreign Minister Asif and several other prominent politicians have lashed out repeatedly.  Opposition leader Khan said Trump\u2019s tweet and other U.S. comments were part of \u201cdeliberate attempts to humiliate and insult the Pakistani nation\u201d and called for retaliation.  \u201cIt is time for Pakistan to delink from the US,\u201d Khan said in a statement, which called for an immediate removal of \u201cexcessive US diplomatic, non-diplomatic and intelligence personnel from Pakistan\u201d.  Khan also called for a suspension of land and air transport routes through Pakistan that the U.S. uses to resupply NATO troops in Afghanistan, a move Pakistani officials privately say is unlikely unless relations drastically deteriorate.  U.S. aid suspension was announced days after Trump tweeted that United States had foolishly given Pakistan $33 billion in aid over 15 years and were rewarded with \u201cnothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools\u201d.  The aid suspension was largely expected by Islamabad but Pakistani officials were taken aback by Trump\u2019s withering tweet and the tone of U.S. announcements.  \u201cThe FBI, his political opponents, African-American football players are used to Trump criticizing them like this on Twitter \u2014 we are not used to it,\u201d said one Pakistani government minister.  \u201cWe were seriously shocked.\u201d  Politicians such as Asif and Khan have been delivering anti-American statements partly to placate domestic audiences, analysts say, with one eye on general elections due in mid-2018.  \u201cThis is the election period and for the first time in Pakistan\u2019s history, anti-Americanism will become an issue in an election campaign,\u201d said Pakistani writer and analyst Zahid Hussain.  There is a long history of anti-Americanism in Pakistan and after the Osama bin Laden raid, which many Pakistanis saw as violation of the country\u2019s sovereignty, relations neared breaking point in 2011.  That year, NATO forces bombed a Pakistani army checkpoint, killing 24 soldiers, and CIA contractor Raymond Davis shot dead two Pakistanis in Lahore.  In the north-western city of Peshawar, many Pakistanis cited the aid suspensions as another reason for Pakistan to sever ties with Washington.  \u201cWe are ready to eat grass, but only if our leaders become honest and make bold decisions against the Americans,\u201d said Jalal Noor Khan, 48, a food merchant.  The flag burnings in Lahore and Islamabad were organized by student organizations with links to hardline religious groups. About 60 students were protesting in Islamabad and another 100 in Lahore.  \u201cThe U.S. flag and Trump\u2019s photos are under our feet. It\u2019s a message to them that they will face the same if they did anything wrong against Pakistan,\u201d said Rana Zeeshan, one of the student organizers of the Lahore protest.  \u201cWe will erase the U.S. from the world\u2019s map.\u201d   Additional reporting by Jibran Ahmad in PESHAWAR and Gul Yousafzai in QUETTA; Writing by Drazen Jorgic; editing by Ralph Boulton"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it was suspending at least $900 million in security assistance to Pakistan until it takes action against the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militant groups.  The U.S. State Department announced the decision, saying it reflected the Trump administration\u2019s frustration that Pakistan has not done more against the two groups that Washington says use sanctuaries in Pakistan to launch attacks in neighboring Afghanistan that have killed U.S., Afghan and other forces.  The department declined to say exactly how much aid would be suspended, saying the numbers were still being calculated and included funding from both the State and Defense departments.  Pakistan has long rejected accusations that it fails to tackle the militants battling the Kabul government and U.S.-led foreign forces in Afghanistan, from sanctuaries on its side of the border.  On Friday, Pakistan criticized what it called \u201cshifting goalposts\u201d and said the U.S. suspension of aid was counter-productive.  U.S. officials said two main categories of aid are affected: foreign military financing (FMF), which funds purchases of U.S. military hardware, training and services, and coalition support funds (CSF), which reimburse Pakistan for counter-terrorism operations. They said they could make exceptions to fund critical U.S. national security priorities.  CSF funds, which fall under Defense Department authority, are covered by the freeze, said Pentagon spokesman Commander Patrick Evans, saying Congress authorized up to $900 million in such money for Pakistan for fiscal year 2017, which ended Sept. 30. None of that money has yet been disbursed.  The freeze also covers $255 million in FMF for fiscal year 2016, which falls under State Department authority and whose suspension has already been announced, as well as unspecified amounts of FMF that went unspent in earlier fiscal years.  Briefing reporters, U.S. officials stressed the suspension did not affect civilian aid to Pakistan and that the money could go through if Islamabad took decisive action against the groups.  \u201cOur hope is that they will see this as a further indication of this administration\u2019s immense frustration with the trajectory of our relationship and that they need to be serious about taking the steps we have asked in order to put it on more solid footing,\u201d a senior State Department official told reporters.  \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that Pakistan will see this as an incentive, not a punishment,\u201d he added.  The Trump administration briefed Congress on its decision on Wednesday.  Pakistan is largely shrugging off the proposed U.S. aid cuts but frets that Washington could take more drastic measures to deter what it sees as Pakistan\u2019s support for the Taliban.  Pakistan is worried about the influence of old rival India in Afghanistan, and at the same time has been battling a Pakistani Taliban insurgency that Pakistan says was largely fueled by its support for the U.S. war on terrorism launched after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.  \u201cArbitrary deadlines, unilateral pronouncements and shifting goalposts are counterproductive in addressing common threats,\u201d the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement.  Pakistan was engaged with the U.S. administration on security cooperation and awaited further detail, it said.  Tense ties between the uneasy allies nosedived on Jan. 1 when U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out on Twitter against Islamabad\u2019s \u201clies and deceit\u201d despite $33 billion in aid and the White House warned of \u201cspecific actions\u201d to pressure Pakistan.  Trump\u2019s frustrations are shared by some U.S. lawmakers, who accused Pakistan of playing a double game by allowing militant groups sanctuary - which Islamabad denies - despite promising to crack down on them.  \u201cPakistan is one of the most duplicitous governments I\u2019ve had any involvement with,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters. \u201cTheir, in essence, support of the Haqqani network, or ... allowing them to have safe harbor in their country when they\u2019re the greatest threat to our men and women in uniform.\u201d  South Asia expert Christine Fair of Georgetown University voiced concern that Pakistan might retaliate for the suspension by closing the highways from the port city of Karachi on which equipment is trucked to land-locked Afghanistan and the airspace through which supplies are flown to U.S.-led international forces there.  \u201cWhat is the plan if they close the GLOCs?\u201d she asked, using the military acronym for Ground Lines of Communications.  \u201cWhat if the Pakistanis shut down the ALOCs (Air Lines of Communications). How do you keep supplying the ANSF?\u201d she asked, referring to the Afghan national security forces.  \u201cPakistan could be within their rights if they tell us you don\u2019t have flyover rights anymore,\u201d she said.

          "title": "Clashes break out near South Sudan capital in truce violation",
          "body": "JUBA (Reuters) - Clashes have broken out near South Sudan\u2019s capital Juba between government troops and rebels, officials said on Friday, the latest violation of a ceasefire signed last month.  The deal reached in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa between the government of President Salva Kiir and a myriad of opposition groups had aimed to end a four-year-old war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed.  But several violations have since taken place, for which all sides have been blamed.  On Friday, the army\u2019s spokesman Lul Ruai Koang said several people were killed after rebel troops attempted to seize a military outpost west of Juba held by Kiir\u2019s Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army (SPLA).  \u201cAt about 10:30 p.m. last night, bandits under the direct command of Lieutenant Colonel Chan Garang attacked the SPLA\u2019s position at the north of Kapur,\u201d he told a news conference, referring to a high-ranking officer who defected from the government last year.  Koang did not give details on casualties, but said fighting was going on.  Rebels under former vice president Riek Machar, whose sacking in mid-2013 amid a power struggle triggered the civil war months later, denied any involvement and added soldiers allied with the defected official had acted on their own.  \u201cWe have no hand in what happened in Juba last night,\u201d said Lam Paul Gabriel, the group\u2019s deputy spokesperson. \u201cThose soldiers who are friends to him (Garang) decided to say enough is enough. So they did it.\u201d   The violence prompted the U.S. embassy in Juba to impose a 7 p.m. curfew for unofficial travel.  The conflict in the world\u2019s youngest country has been fought largely along ethnic lines, pitting forces loyal to Kiir - an ethnic Dinka - and Machar, who is Nuer. Other factions have also sprung up ever since.  The war has forced a third of South Sudan\u2019s 12 million-strong population to flee their homes.  The ceasefire is intended to revive a 2015 peace deal that collapsed in 2016 after heavy fighting erupted in Juba, with talks on a new power-sharing arrangement and a new date for polls scheduled to follow.  It is also designed to allow humanitarian groups access to civilians caught in the fighting.  Neighbouring countries who brokered that agreement have warned the warring sides that they would back punitive measures if violations persisted.  The United States, Britain and Norway, who form a group that supported a 2005 accord that led to South Sudan\u2019s independence from Sudan, have also threatened to impose individual or group sanctions for those violating the ceasefire.

          "title": "Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.  World stocks started the year with their best week in over a year and while it\u2019s tempting to say \u201csame old, same old\u201d as markets smash another host of milestones and records, you still have to take a step back and assess what\u2019s happening.   There are some who will dismiss this as another bout of mindless bubble blowing and insist it will all end in tears. Perhaps it will. But the more sober assessment is that we are going through the first boom in the world economy in over a decade.   Global industrial output raced higher at more than a 5 percent annualized rate last month and more than 4 percent for the fourth quarter as a whole. The G10 economic surprise index \u2013 which nets positive over negative hits and misses on incoming data \u2013 continues to hover close to its most positive readings in almost 8 years.   There will be harder data on industrial output for Q4 next week, as well as trade data readings from China and tech soundings in Asia from the likes of Samsung. Inflation-focused central banks that have fueled all this with their record cheap money will be looking at the rising price of oil meanwhile.  Graphic: The new year party for world markets - reut.rs/2Cwwb25  Perhaps one reason for the latest run up in stocks, the Q4 earnings season, comes back onto the radar, with the big U.S. financials kicking off at the end of the week.   JPMorgan Chase and rival Wells Fargo launch the earnings season with reports before the opening bell on Friday. Even despite the record low financial market volatility that\u2019s crimping trading revenues, deal making has been super brisk over recent months and overall fee income from banks around the world rose some 16 percent last year to a record level of more than $100 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.      The numbers should be good. Blended year-on-year Q4 earnings growth for the S&P 500 overall is expected to be 11.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates, up from 8.5 percent in Q3. Excluding the energy sector, which benefits from weak year-earlier comparisons, it is seen at 9.5 percent.      Data which runs since 1994 shows that in a typical quarter 64 percent of companies beat estimates and 21 percent miss estimates. Over the past four quarters, however, 72 percent have beaten the Street estimates and only 19 percent have missed them.  Graphic: U.S. earnings estimates - reut.rs/2Cw0XIj  Officials from North and South Korea will meet on Tuesday for their first official talks in more than two years.  Agreeing to the meeting represents a turnaround by Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, which has focused in the past 12 months on developing its nuclear arsenal amid bellicose exchanges with U.S. President Donald Trump, raising alarm across the world.   The meeting is expected to focus on the North potentially sending athletes to the Winter Olympics to be held in the South in February as well as on some other inter-Korean relations, according to Seoul.   Every word and gesture will be scrutinized by geopolitical analysts as they try to judge if this really is a re-emerging detente between the two nations, not to mention the reaction from Trump\u2019s twitter account.    Graphic: North & South Korea - Lines of communication IMG: tmsnrt.rs/2CtuIJS  A blizzard of data is expected to show China\u2019s economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note. However, activity has  remained more resilient than expected despite a crackdown on industrial pollution, overzealous lending and a cooling property market.  The week kicks off with forex reserves data and a bunch of inflation numbers, before the focus will switch to trade figures out on Friday. Exports are expected to have jumped more than 9 percent in December after soaring unexpectedly 12.3 percent in November thanks to sustained strength in global demand.  A slight pullback in December industrial growth, producer inflation and investment would all reinforce consensus views that the world\u2019s second-largest economy will slow only marginally in 2018. A more marked loss of momentum may put fears of a sharper slowdown back on the table, unsettle the yuan and possibly stall the government\u2019s push to reduce rising debt.  Graphic: China Economic Snapshot - Trade: reut.rs/2CWFqcZ  It may be the depths of winter with storms tearing across the euro zone, but the political and economic skies are almost cloudless all of a sudden.   On Sunday, Angela Merkel will begin trying to re-form a \u2018grand coalition\u2019, an effort that could rumble on for a few months, and campaigning for Italy\u2019s uncertain election in March is also getting underway, but the rest of the bloc looks buoyant.  Perhaps the most eye-catching thing is that crisis posterchild Greece\u2019s borrowing costs hit their lowest in 12 years on Friday on expectations that the country could conclude its euro zone/IMF bailout package later this year.  That would cap a slowly strengthening recovery eight years after Greece lurched on the brink of defaulting on its debt and risked being kicked out of the single currency bloc.

The price of one loaf of bread rose from 0.5 Sudanese pounds  to 1 pound, the union said, after the prices of wheat flour rose.  The country\u2019s biggest opposition party called for peaceful protests against the new budget, and crowds gathered outside bakeries in Khartoum, expressing frustration against the government\u2019s move.  \u201cThe new prices will make us starve to death,\u201d Fatima Ahmed, a housewife said while buying bread. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t care about us.

The government would buy locally produced wheat at \u201cencouraging prices\u201d, he said.  The country devalued its currency, the pound, to 18 per U.S. dollar, more than double its previous peg of 6.7 pounds to the dollar.

Zimbabwe is due to hold elections in 2018 in the first big test of Mnangagwa\u2019s legitimacy after he rose to power in November last year following a de facto military coup which saw veteran leader Robert Mugabe reluctantly cede power.  Mnangagwa has previously indicated polls could be held as early as March, and is under pressure from civil society, would-be investors and opposition parties to implement political reforms following Mugabe\u2019s 37-year grip on power.   \u201cCurrently there is no need,\u201d Mnangagwa told reporters, referring to the possibility of forming a coalition with Tsvangirai\u2019s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).  Mnangagwa\u2019s ZANU-PF party and the MDC were partners in a government of national unity for five years until 2013, eventually breaking down as acrimony between the parties re-emerged.   Tsvangirai, who is due to challenge Mnangagwa in national elections, has been receiving treatment for colon cancer since 2016 but says he is in good health.   \u201cHe is fine, he is recuperating very well and says he will soon again be having a medical check-up in South Africa,\u201d said Mnangagwa after visiting Tsvangirai at his home.

          "body": "* Amorepacific began selling in France in 2017  * Aims to draw customers with herbal-inspired formulas  * Rival South Korean firms also working on Europe business  By Sarah White and Pascale Denis  PARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - South Korean cosmetics company Amorepacific aims to expand in Europe by launching one of its luxury brands in Britain this year and in Germany in 2019, after introducing its products in France in 2017, a senior executive said.  Amorepacific, South Korea\u2019s biggest beauty firm, began selling its luxury Sulwhasoo brand of creams and other cosmetic products in Galeries Lafayette department store in Paris in September.  Thierry Maman, the head of the group\u2019s European operations, said its products should reach British department stores, such as Selfridges, this year, with Germany to follow after that.  Maman, hired by Amorepacific in 2015 from the perfume and beauty arm of LVMH\u2019s Givenchy, said the Paris outlet was \u201ca good testing ground\u201d as the label considered whether to open its own stores or offer its products through other shops.  \u201cYou don\u2019t become international from one day to the next,\u201d he said.  The group first tried to break into the French cosmetics market, one of the world\u2019s most competitive, 30 years ago but withdrew after just two years due to poor sales. It bought French perfume house Annick Goutal in 2011.  Maman said France was a tough market but added Sulwhasoo was betting on drawing customers with its traditional, herbal-inspired formulas.  South Korean beauty products, which have expanded in Asia and especially China, have gained a reputation for innovation and using natural ingredients, such as snail slime or tea leaves.  Other Korean firms have attracted foreign investors and pushed into Europe, such as Dr.Jart+, partly backed by Estee Lauder and whose products are sold in the beauty chain Sephora.  Rivals often offer cheaper ranges of skincare or make-up products, which are particularly popular with young consumers.  Amorepacific, whose products include a sponge applicator for make-up that has been mimicked by global brands like L\u2019Oreal\u2019s Lancome, might offer more of its middle-of-the-range labels to Europe in future, Maman said.  Amorepacific\u2019s European revenues, including Goutal, were less than 50 million euros ($60.2 million) annually but were expected to rise by 20 percent in 2018, Maman said.  Amorepacific\u2019s sales were hit this year by diplomatic tensions with China that reduced Chinese tourists to South Korea.  Relations are now on the mend, but Amorepacific Corp\u2019s sales fell 8 percent to about 4 trillion won ($3.8 billion) in the year to September.

          "title": "From shadows to town hall: Nicaragua female mayor to put women first",
          "body": "BOGOTA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Born into Nicaragua\u2019s indigenous Miskito community, Rose Cunningham was only too well aware of the challenges girls faced in getting their voices heard in a culture dominated by men.  But against the odds, in November Cunningham was elected the first indigenous women mayor of Waspam, a municipality of about 60,000 people on Nicaragua\u2019s impoverished Atlantic coast.  \u201cUntil recently, an indigenous woman was invisible, behind the man, they were shadows,\u201d said Cunningham, who will be sworn in next week.  One of her priorities as mayor will be to combat sexual and domestic violence against women and human trafficking, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Sharing a porous border with Honduras, Nicaragua\u2019s remote northern coastal areas are corridors for all types of cross-border trafficking.  \u201cThere are many blind spots (along the Honduras border) through which people can go through. There\u2019s trafficking of all kinds - drugs, arms and people,\u201d she said.  Indigenous women and children are particularly at risk of being trafficked into the sex trade, Cunningham said.  Traffickers prey on poor indigenous families with false promises of good jobs in cities and tourist hotspots in Nicaragua and across its borders, often as domestic workers or farm laborers.  \u201cIt\u2019s easier to trick a woman from a poor community with little education,\u201d Cunningham said.  Traffickers are known to operate in schools where they lure teenagers with false offers of work, according to the U.N.\u2019s children agency UNICEF.  With her election victory, Cunningham has defied social norms that dictate women stay in the kitchen, look after children and stay silent about domestic abuse.  She said as mayor she would confront macho attitudes in society that fuel violence against women, a problem UN Women has described as a \u201cnational epidemic\u201d in Nicaragua.  \u201cThere are different types of violence that women face, physical, sexual and psychological,\u201d Cunningham said.  Girls walking long distances to get to school are particularly at risk of being sexually assaulted along their journey.  She said engaging with male village elders and airing radio shows in the local Miskito language about women\u2019s rights and the dangers of trafficking could help combat gender violence.  Women across Nicaragua are increasingly occupying positions of power at the local government level due to a 2012 quota requiring gender parity.   The Central American nation now boosts the region\u2019s highest number of women mayors with women making up 40 percent of mayors, followed by Cuba.  Across the region, women account for less than 14 percent of elected mayors, according to the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).

Powell, who joined the Fed in mid-2012, said little on the program publicly at the time, and the transcripts offer a look at the contrast between his lukewarm embrace of the stimulus and the full-throated support from Yellen, who at time was No. 2 on the Fed Board.  The Fed releases meeting transcripts with a five-year delay, and published those from 2012 on Friday.  \u201cAbsent further policy action, I see little chance that unemployment will decline in the foreseeable future,\u201d Yellen said at the same September 2012 meeting, according to the transcript. \u201cWe should not delay action any further.\u201d  The transcripts also show plenty of light between Powell and Yellen in terms of how they come to, and frame, their policy views around the rate-setting table.  While Yellen\u2019s comments are typically studded with references to models and the economic literature, Powell\u2019s were often anecdote-driven. At the September meeting, for instance, he cited conversations with private equity investors that suggested to him the U.S. economy was still on good long-term footing.  Powell said it was telling that, despite the ongoing crisis in Europe, private equity investors appeared eager to snap up U.S. companies.  \u201cThey\u2019re seeing something. They really are,\u201d he said, according to the transcript.  Reporting by Ann Saphir in San Francisco and Lindsay Dunsmuir\nand Jason Lange in Washington; Editing by Andrea Ricci"

          "title": "Coal dwarfs battery metals in mining deals despite war on pollution",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Coal and iron ore dominated mining takeovers in 2017, Thomson Reuters data shows, with buyers favoring the heavily polluting devil they know over the uncertainties of a battery-powered future.  While the biggest deal was in Brazil, China was a top player despite planning to reduce domestic coal and steel-making to tackle smog in its cities. Elsewhere, miners haunted by the overpriced mega-purchases they made before the commodities crash of 2015 hesitated on deals involving the metals needed to run electric cars.  Mining deals totaled $96.8 billion, based on 2,109 mostly modestly-sized transactions in the past year, Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence showed. That marked a 10 percent increase in value from 2016 but fell far short of $150-$200 billion totals in the boom years, after which miners had to write billions of dollars off the value of their assets.  More than $92 billion of the 2017 total was spent on coal, iron ore and steel deals as investors stayed loyal to a sector that still generates steady profits despite the global drive to reduce pollution.   Analysts predict continued demand, even though coal is the biggest source of the carbon emissions that the 2015 Paris Agreement aims to curb. Steel-making, which uses iron ore and coking coal, accounts for an estimated seven percent of industrial direct CO2 emissions, industry figures show.       For the mining sector, the minerals offer an established way of making money when ultra-low official interest rates mean relatively cheap funding is available to purchase assets.  \u201cIf you are a buyer, maybe you think you can squeeze some cost out of it thanks to the low cost of capital,\u201d Brewin Dolphin equity analyst Nik Stanojevic said, adding that emerging markets such as China and India will continue to rely on coal for years to come.  Demand from these huge and growing economies will help to counter the trend against fossil fuels.   Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund has proposed dropping oil and gas companies from its benchmark index while Britain said on Friday it will set an emissions limit on coal-fired power stations from 2025, forcing them to close unless they use carbon capture technology.  China is pushing to limit consumption of coal, which is used to produce most of its electricity. But its coal output will still be around 3.9 billion tonnes a year by 2020 and on Friday it announced plans to create several \u201csuper-large\u201d mining companies by then.  Demand for metals used in making batteries, such as lithium, cobalt and nickel, is expected to soar as China leads the shift to electric vehicles. But investors regard them as less certain to guarantee profits because prices are volatile and the basic minerals require additional processing for use in batteries.  Lithium and cobalt CBD3 in particular look overpriced. Spot battery grade 99.5 percent lithium carbonate in China AM-995C-LTCB, where most lithium batteries are made, rose around a third in 2017, while cobalt prices more than doubled.      Analysts and bankers say mining companies are holding fire on battery deals due to the risk of paying too much, as they did for assets at the height of the commodities boom that culminated in 2012.  \u201cWe\u2019re hoping the industry has learned some cautionary lessons,\u201d said analyst Paul Gait at Bernstein, adding it would be very unwise to buy projects such as lithium in the current market. \u201cIt should be left to its own devices. The lithium price is coming down. There\u2019s no way this is the bottom of the cycle.\u201d  The most active dealmaker of the major miners Glencore (GLEN.L) - whose $46 billion merger with Xstrata in 2013 was the biggest mining transaction of all time - said repeatedly in the past year that it favored bolt-ons and partnerships to avoid the high levels of debt involved in over-ambitious deal-making.      In 2017 the number of mining deals grew 27 percent to the highest figure since 2012 as miners focused mostly on relatively small transactions, the Thomson Reuters data showed.      Brazil accounted for the highest value deal, iron ore giant Vale\u2019s (VALE3.SA) $21 billion acquisition of shareholder group Valepar - although analysts said this was a matter of standardizing the shareholder structure rather than constituting a classic M&A deal. It was the only transaction above $5 billion in 2017.      Brazil\u2019s mining M&A deals in 2017 totaled $22.9 billion, just ahead of China\u2019s $18.8 billion as Coral Pearl International Ltd bought Iron Ore Mining International from neighboring Mongolia and a Chinese investor group snapped up Huaibei Mining Co Ltd at home.  The Mongolian deal falls under Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road policy of developing infrastructure beyond its borders. This has driven deal-making and allegations from Western analysts that China is simply moving its emissions and excess capacity beyond its borders - as many Western economies have long done.    China\u2019s deals were down from $37.7 billion in 2016 following the imposition of capital controls, but overall mergers and acquisitions began to pick up late last year.  With President Donald Trump championing domestic energy production, U.S. companies including CONSOL Energy Inc-Coal Assets and Peabody Energy Corp also made purchases.   Elsewhere, Glencore did a deal with Yancoal to buy a stake in coal assets that the Chinese firm acquired from Rio Tinto (RIO.AX) (RIO.L).  Shrewd future buys could include nickel or copper - minerals that Gait predicted had further upside as well as exposure to the electric vehicle market that offers a potentially huge source of demand for big miners, once it takes off globally. Copper is coveted as a mineral useful to both the old and new economies, but finding high quality projects to buy at the right price is likely to be hard.      BHP (BHP.AX) (BLT.L), the world\u2019s biggest miner, said it believes exploration, not acquisition, is the best way to find new copper supplies.

          "body": "* Zinc reaches highest since August 2007 at $3,375/T  * GRAPHIC-2017 asset returns: tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl  * LME/ShFE arb: bit.ly/2wZSAEz (Updates with closing prices, adds details)  By Maytaal Angel  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Zinc hit its highest in more than a decade on Friday as concerns over market tightness persisted, while copper hit a two-week low as Chinese investor interest was muted with the Lunar New Year holidays looming.  Zinc stocks held in London Metal Exchange warehouses MZN-STOCKS fell 250 tonnes to their lowest since late 2008, data showed on Friday, down about a third from their October peak.  The global zinc market deficit widened to 36,900 tonnes in October from a revised deficit of 35,900 tonnes in September, the latest industry data show.  \u201cWe\u2019ve always seen Q1 2018 as the peak of the zinc rally and were looking previously for $3,400/t. Zinc has got very strong momentum, it\u2019s entirely possible it could pierce that level on a three- to six-month basis,\u201d said Macquarie analyst Vivienne Lloyd.  But she added: \u201cZinc supply is slowly coming back and the greater length of time zinc displays a large price disparity to aluminium the more likely we\u2019ll see substitution.\u201d  * ZINC PRICE: Three-month zinc on the London Metal Exchange ended down 0.2 percent at $3,354 a tonne, having hit its highest since August 2007 at $3,375.  * TECHNICALS: Indicating near-term market tightness, the premium for cash over the three-month contract CMZN0-3 was at $22.50 a tonne, against a $10.25 discount on Dec. 20.  * COPPER PRICE: Copper ended down 1 percent at $7,120 a tonne, after gaining 7 percent in December.  \u201cPhysical interest remains muted across the majority of these metals and Chinese buying (is) likely to remain (muted) until after their New Year holidays next month,\u201d said Marex Spectron in a note.  * WIDER MARKETS: World stocks scaled fresh record highs on Friday while the dollar reversed its losses against the euro after a brief dip following a weaker than expected U.S. jobs report.  * CHINA: A blizzard of data in coming weeks is expected to show China\u2019s economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note, but activity has likely remained more resilient than expected despite a crackdown on industrial pollution and a cooling property market.  * CHILE: Unionised workers at Glencore\u2019s Lomas Bayas copper mine in Chile rejected a final contract offer and began government-facilitated mediation on Thursday to avoid a strike.  * STEEL BAN: China will continue to \u201cunswervingly\u201d cut existing steel capacity and strictly ban the launch of any new steelmaking facilities in 2018, its government said this week.  * OTHER METALS: Lead ended down 1.8 percent at $2,540, aluminium closed down 2.1 percent at $2,203, tin ended up 0.6 percent at $19,975 while nickel closed down 1 percent at $12,525.

          "title": "Sterling trades sideways as investors look to Brexit talks for cues",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling steadied against the dollar on Friday, ending the week at much the same levels it started at, with traders keen to see new developments on Brexit negotiations before taking new positions on the British currency.   Economic data released over the week have pointed to the economy picking up at the end of last year, with businesses growing more optimistic about the year ahead. But that has had little impact on the currency.  Numbers released on Friday showing Britain\u2019s economic productivity rose at its fastest rate in more than six years in the three months to Sept. 30 - though in absolute terms still barely above its level of nearly a decade ago - did not give the pound any additional support.  BNP Paribas currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown said data released on Thursday showing British consumers increased their borrowing by the smallest amount since mid-2015 in the three months to November could spell bad news for sterling.  \u201cGiven that the decline in real spending in the UK has been smaller than the decline in real wages, consumption is vulnerable, and we should start to see that feed through into softer activity data and then eventually into a weaker pound,\u201d he said.   Sterling was trading flat on the day at $1.3563. It had hit a 3-1/2-month high of $1.3614 on Wednesday, less than half a cent away from its highest since the Brexit vote, but traders said it needed new catalysts to break any higher.   A Reuters poll of currency strategists on Friday showed the pound is expected to mostly hold steady against both a shaky dollar and the firming euro this year, but much will hinge on progress in Britain\u2019s talks with Brussels on its withdrawal from the European Union.  The strategists, who were polled in the first week of 2018, were not brimming with optimism on how the next stage of talks will go, but most do not think the pound is set for another major fall.  \u201cThe pound\u2019s ongoing resilience continues to support our view from over a year ago that a lot of bad news (has) already (been) priced in,\u201d MUFG currency analysts said.  \u201cAn important positive implication for the pound is that the risk of a more disorderly \u2018No Deal\u2019 Brexit outcome has diminished and the pound should strengthen if fears over a more disruptive and harder Brexit outcome do not materialise.\u201d  Against the euro, sterling rose by a third of a percentage point to 88.77 pence.

          "title": "UK needs 'latte levy' on disposable coffee cups to cut waste: lawmakers",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should charge a 25-pence ($0.34) \u201clatte levy\u201d on disposable coffee cups to cut down waste and ban them if a recycling target is not met by 2023, a committee of lawmakers said on Friday.  Less than 1 percent of coffee cups are recycled in Britain because of the tightly bonded plastic liner, the difficulties of recycling packaging which has been in contact with food and drink and a lack of facilities, the lawmakers said.  Chains Pret A Manger, Costa Coffee, Caffe Nero and Greggs alongside U.S. firm Starbucks are among the biggest coffee-sellers in Britain and have rapidly expanded in the last 10 years to meet increasing demand.  Although some outlets give a discount to customers using their own cup, only 1-2 percent of buyers take up the offer, according to parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee which said a \u201clatte levy\u201d was needed instead.  \u201cThe UK throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year; enough to circle the planet five and a half times,\u201d said Chair of the committee, Mary Creagh.  \u201cWe\u2019re calling for action to reduce the number of single use cups, promote reusable cups over disposable cups and to recycle all coffee cups by 2023,\u201d she said.  The committee said that money raised by the charge should help improve recycling facilities and if the 2023 target is not met then disposable coffee cups should be banned.   The Irish parliament is considering banning single-use coffee cups whilst the German city Hamburg said in 2016 it will no longer use coffee-makers with aluminum capsules in its own offices or buildings.   In October 2015, Britain introduced a charge of 5 pence on all single-use plastic bags provided by large shops, which led to an 83 percent reduction in UK plastic bags used in the first year.   On Friday the environment ministry said the government was working closely with the sector and had made progress in increasing recycling rates.  \u201cWe are encouraged by industry action to increase the recycling of paper cups with some major retail chains now offering discounts to customers with reusable cups,\u201d said a ministry spokeswoman.  \u201cWe will carefully consider the committee\u2019s recommendations and respond shortly,\u201d she said.  Caffe Nero said it was working with others to understand and address the issues which prevent the widespread recycling of paper cups.    Costa Coffee and Greggs said they offered a discount to those using reusable cups but Costa said the government also needed to focus on improving recycling infrastructure. Pret A Manger\u2019s customers have benefited from a 50 pence discount from this week.  U.S chain Starbucks will trial a 5 pence levy at up to 25 London branches in February for three months.   \u201cWe will investigate the impact of a 5p charge on a paper cup, coupled with prominent marketing of reusable cups, on customer behavior,\u201d it said in a statement posted on its website.

          "title": "Fitch Affirms VodafoneZiggo at BB-; Outlook Remains Negative",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, January 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed VodafoneZiggo Group B.V's (VodafoneZiggo) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB-'. The Outlook remains Negative. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. VodafoneZiggo's ratings take into account the company's strong business profile, stabilising financial performance and high financial leverage. Medium-term expectations of an improving market structure underpin prospects for a stronger revenue outlook. The Negative Outlook is driven by financial leverage, which is expected to remain above its downgrade threshold in 2018 and 2019. Shareholder payments and the delivery of target synergies are important if this metric is to improve. KEY RATING DRIVERS Shareholder Payments Key: Moderating shareholder payments along with the delivery of synergies are key to future deleveraging. Management increased its 2017 distribution guidance by EUR250 million with its operating cash flow (OCF) guidance upgrade. Effectively leveraging cash flows by a factor of 5x underlines Fitch's view that leverage will be managed on the high side. High Leverage: Financial leverage is too high for the rating. FFO adjusted net leverage is forecast by Fitch to end 2017 at 5.7x (as previously expected) against a downgrade threshold of 5.2x. Although improving as OCF strengthens, we expect leverage to remain above 5.2x through to 2019.  In addition, VodafoneZiggo's net leverage as defined in the transaction documents at 4.54x in Q32017 remains in compliance with its covenant. Management guidance for 2018 OCF and shareholder payments will provide a strong signal for the pace of future deleveraging; distribution guidance that sustains leverage above 5.2x indefinitely is likely to lead to a downgrade. VodafoneZiggo's operational performance is improving. Upgraded 2017 OCF guidance of EUR1.7 billion (previously EUR1.65 billion) suggests integration is on track. Dutch Telecoms Remain Pressured: The Dutch telecoms market, like many in Europe has been through a period of sustained pressure and market contraction. A progressive incumbent has invested effectively in fibre and TV, while a four-player mobile market has been challenged in particular by the presence of aggressively positioned Tele2. Data from market regulator ACM identifies an aggregate market contraction (including subscription TV) of 9% between 2013 and 2016, with aggregate fixed revenues down 14% and mobile falling 8%. Trends appear to be stabilising. The overall market was down 2.8% in 2016, although mobile, down 4.6%, remains pressured. Subscription TV has been positive, with growth above 1.5% in each of the past three years, with the incumbent and others taking market share from cable. High mobile data usage, appetite for ultrafast (more than 100Mbit/s speed) fixed broadband and bundling are expected to support improvements in market trends. Cable Operations Stabilised: Challenges in the cable business following the 2014 merger of Ziggo and UPC have been addressed. Combined 9M17 cable revenues were up 0.2% following a 2% decline in 2016. Consumer cable revenues have shown increasing strength, stabilising in 3Q17 while B2B cable revenues are growing strongly. This as an important step in a market where competition from the telecoms incumbent, KPN, has been high but is expected to be more rational given the market structure following the creation of VodafoneZiggo. Mobile Pressures Remain: The mobile environment continues to be difficult, both across the market and for VodafoneZiggo. VodafoneZiggo's combined mobile revenues were down 10% in 9M17, with business mobile down 12.4% showing particular weakness - trends which have become progressively worse through the year. These pressures have been driven by intense competition as well as regulation - the introduction of roam-like-home tariffs in Europe and termination rate cuts. Fitch expects operating conditions and mobile performance to remain tough in 1H18 but show improvements into the second half of 2018. Business Profile Strengthened, Convergence Important: Market conditions and competition remain pressured, but Fitch believes the combination of the country's national cable operator and the mobile market number two, position VodafoneZiggo strongly in a market which is ultimately likely to become more rational and where convergence will be important. This trend can be seen in the 780,000 of VodafoneZiggo's 3.9 million fixed-line subscribers who are now converged customers. Mobile competition has yet to ease; Fitch nonetheless expects VodafoneZiggo and incumbent, KPN, to benefit from consumer appetite for high broadband speeds in fixed and quad-play services. The ability to stream content across multiple devices and technology platforms will be attractive and increase convergent penetration. The proposed merger of T-Mobile and Tele2 in the Netherlands underlines the importance of convergence. In the near term mobile pressures are unlikely to ease, but over the longer term Fitch expects a more balanced and rational market, albeit one where the convergent landscape will be more competitive. DERIVATION SUMMARY VodafoneZiggo's ratings are underpinned by a solid operating profile, strengthened by the prospect of a strong convergent position following formation of the JV and an improved operating environment. The cable business appears to be stabilising. Its mobile operations remain under pressure given the competitive environment, while the company exhibits weaker financial metrics than would be expected at the rating level, including high leverage. The company's closest peers - Virgin Media Inc. and Telenet N.V. (both BB-/Stable) - offer similar characteristics in terms of business and market potential, but are performing better operationally and have stronger financial metrics. Fitch expects business performance at VodafoneZiggo to stabilise and improve over time. When the rating stabilises will depend on the timing of integration benefits and recovery in the mobile business, along with the shareholders' ultimate intentions with respect to distributions and leverage KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case include: -  revenues of around EUR4.0 billion in 2017; - 2017 OCF/EBITDA before integration costs (of approximately EUR30 million) of EUR1.7 billion, which value includes the shareholder recharges of around EUR235m; - the following forecast years reflect revenue growth stabilisation and margin expansion reflecting scale economies and the delivery of synergies: - 50% of shareholder recharges written back to FFO - reflecting their capex nature; - 2017 capex to sales of around 24% - including EUR0.1 billion of shareholder recharge capex, with  capex/sales excluding the recharge of around 21%; - Shareholder payments of EUR750 million in 2017, and EUR600 million a year thereafter. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action FFO adjusted net leverage sustainably below 4.5x (5.5x at end-2016 pro-forma for escrowed cash), with strong and stable FCF generation, reflecting a stable competitive and regulatory environment Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action Failure to reduce FFO adjusted net leverage to below 5.2x by end-2018 on a sustainable basis Further deterioration in competitive pressures and inability to show recovery in operational performance. Signs of a stabilising revenue environment in mobile towards the end of 2018 are considered an important operating metric (added language to previously published guidance). LIQUIDITY Sound Liquidity: At end-3Q17 the company reported cash of EUR392 million and an undrawn credit facility due 2022 of EUR800 million. Experience across the Liberty Global group is that cash is typically managed at low levels. Comments from VodafoneZiggo's joint shareholders indicate this is also likely to be the case in the JV and available excess cash upstreamed to the shareholders. The debt structure is a combination of secured bank and bond debt, and unsecured bonds. Vendor financing is not included in covenant leverage but is included in all Fitch defined metrics.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil prices have risen above $60 per barrel which should accelerate shale drilling and production in the next few months, provided the price increase is sustained.  U.S. crude futures are trading over $60 for all delivery months between February and August 2018, an increase of about 40 percent since the middle of 2017.  And the futures strip for 2019, the benchmark against which U.S. shale producers can execute hedges for next year\u2019s output, is trading over $56, up almost 20 percent on the last six months.  Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources, one of the largest producers in North Dakota and Oklahoma, said last year that prices needed to be above $50 to be sustainable.  Analysis of earnings statements and drilling behavior of the shale firms confirmed most were not breaking when futures prices were below $50.  Breakeven prices for shale vary tremendously between different companies, different basins and even different wells within the same play.  But with futures prices above $60, a much wider range of wells and shale plays should now be profitable.  Futures prices are sending a clear signal to shale firms that they should step up drilling programs and boost output.  Experience shows changes in drilling rates generally follow changes in futures prices with a lag of about 16 to 20 weeks.  Futures prices have been rising fairly consistently for 27 weeks since hitting a trough around $43 in late June 2017.  Drilling rates, as measured by the Baker Hughes rig count, started turning up 19 weeks later, consistent with normal behavior.  The rig count unexpectedly stalled in the second half of December, but the continued increase in futures prices strongly suggests the rig count will start increasing again and should rise at least through March and April.  Shale production is already increasing strongly as a result of the growing number of wells drilled earlier in 2017 and completed in the second half of last year.  Monthly completion rates across the seven major shale plays climbed from 700 in January 2017 to 921 in June and 1,086 in November, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Production from the Lower 48 states excluding the Gulf of Mexico, much of it from shale formations, has surged from 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in January 2017 to 7.0 million bpd in June and 7.7 million bpd in October.  Production from the Lower 48 excluding federal waters in the Gulf is forecast to top 8 million bpd before the end of 2018, according to the Energy Information Administration.  The continued rise in prices makes it more likely the forecast will prove correct and onshore output will top 8 million bpd even earlier this year.  The more U.S. crude prices rise, the bigger the eventual production response is likely to be, which could significantly complicate OPEC\u2019s attempt to draw down global oil inventories.  OPEC must decide how far it is willing to allow prices to rise before increasing shale output threatens both its market share and its plan to reduce inventories.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Asian spot LNG prices rose to highs not seen since November 2014 on strong demand as a cold snap stimulated consumption in China and India launched fresh purchase tenders.  Spot prices for February delivery steadied at $11.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), 10 cents above Jan. 2 levels.   Heavy snowfall across parts of China curbed deliveries of LNG both by truck and by tanker into some import terminals, with temperatures also forecast to fall well below average in Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing and Shanghai from next week, according to data on the Reuters Eikon terminal.   As a result, demand for spot cargoes from Japan, South Korea and China was expected to remain firm, traders said.   Japanese utilities have been actively buying cargoes in recent weeks as cold weather sweeping the country has fueled demand to replenish depleted stocks.  China, which surpassed South Korea as the world\u2019s second-biggest LNG importer, continues to attract spot cargoes after rapid consumption growth in 2017, when imports rose by more than 48 percent.  Indian demand was particularly strong. Petronet and Gail both closed tenders this week to pick up supplies, though the outcome of the award could not be confirmed.  Bharat Petroleum also launched a tender seeking a cargo for the second half of February.  On the supply side, Indonesia\u2019s Bontang plant was expected to award a tender to sell about 11 cargoes between February and December.   Output from two Australian projects, Wheatstone and Gorgon, improved markedly after conclusion of maintenance-related outages.   U.S. spot prices also hit record highs after snowstorms lashed the East Coast. Algonquin Citigate within-day prices hit $82.75 per mmBtu, Henry Hub was at $4.65 per mmBtu and Transco Z6 New York prices hit $140.25 per mmBtu.  The price of month-ahead gas on the Henry Hub, the country\u2019s most liquid hub, were less influenced by the temporary blast of cold weather, trading at $2.795 per mmBtu.   Still, importers were looking to bring spot shipments into the under-used Everett terminal in Boston and Canaport terminal in Canada, which can be used to serve customers in the United States.   Pipeline limitations prevent those local markets from drawing in enough supply during times of peak demand, prompting a surge in prices for spot LNG sellers.   A cargo from Trinidad and Tobago aboard the Provalys tanker is currently unloading at Everett.   Editing by David Goodman"

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has changed the status of its national oil giant  Aramco to a joint-stock company as of Jan. 1, in a key step for an initial public offering (IPO) planned for later this year.  The sale of up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco, expected to go ahead in the second half of 2018, is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to reduce the dependence of the Saudi economy on oil. The plan is championed by Saudi crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.  The change, which was published in a cabinet decree in the kingdom\u2019s official bulletin on Friday, is a requirement for local companies in Saudi Arabia ahead of listing, a senior Aramco source, who declined to be named, told Reuters.  \u201cAs a customary step in the preparation process for a Saudi IPO, Saudi Aramco has converted to a joint stock company,\u201d the source said.  \u201cThis establishes the framework to allow future investors to hold shares in the company alongside its shareholder, the government.\u201d  But it is an important step as it shows the IPO process, which could be the biggest in history raising up to $100 billion, is moving ahead despite market speculation it could be delayed or totally shelved.  Prince Mohammad told Reuters in October it was still on track for 2018.  Aramco has a fully paid capital of 60 billion riyals ($16.00 billion) divided into 200 billion ordinary shares, according to the company\u2019s bylaws published in the official bulletin.   The firm\u2019s board will have 11 members and the power to list the company in domestic and international markets, it said. The government will propose 6 members of Aramco\u2019s board, but shareholders with a more than 0.1 percent stake will have the right to propose a member to the general assembly.  The government will have the right to appoint or change the company\u2019s chairman, a position currently held by Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih.  The government will remain the major shareholder of Aramco and retain the ultimate decision on output levels and production capacity, it said.  \u201cThe state will remain the only responsible entity to make the final decisions regarding the maximum levels of hydrocarbons that can be produced at any time,\u201d it said.    Saudi officials have said domestic and international exchanges such as New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong have been looked at for a partial listing of the state-run oil firm.  They also left the door open for other options including an exclusive listing on the kingdom\u2019s bourse Tadawul and an IPO coupled with a private placement to a strategic investor as a precursor to an international IPO.  Aramco\u2019s IPO will comply with regulations of the Saudi stock exchange and also regulations of the international market where it will be listed, the official bulletin said.  Investors have long debated whether Aramco could be valued anywhere close to $2 trillion, the figure announced by the crown prince, who wants to raise cash through the IPO to finance investment aimed at helping wean the world\u2019s biggest oil exporting nation off its dependency on crude.  A kingpin of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia is also leading members and other rival oil producers such as Russia to restrict oil supplies under a global oil pact to drain inventories and boost oil prices.  In November, OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 as they try to finish clearing a global glut of crude while signaling a possible early exit from the deal if the market overheats.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - European shares powered higher on Friday, with the British and Swiss benchmarks hitting records, propelled by optimism for a strengthening regional economy and gains in U.S. equities overnight.   The pan-European STOXX 600  index was up 0.5 percent by 0944 GMT, holding at a two-month high, while euro zone blue chips .STOXX50E rose 0.9 percent, building on strong gains in the previous session.   The first trading week of the new year was shaping up to be the best for euro zone stocks .STOXXE since last May, as the index has shrugged off a strengthening of the single currency that can dampen export earnings.   \u201cThere is little impediment for continued gains whilst economic conditions that we\u2019ve seen over the last few months continue, and there\u2019s every reason to expect that to continue to be the case,\u201d Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.  \u201cEvery now and then when things are right you do get quite spectacular advances.\u201d  U.S. jobs numbers on Thursday showed U.S. private employers added more jobs than expected in December, propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI past the 25,000-mark for the first time. Investors were watching U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later on Friday.  Euro zone stocks were set for a weekly gain of 2.7 percent.  Markets outside of the euro zone saw several record levels broken. Switzerland's blue chip SMI .SSMI index rose 0.4 percent to an all-time high, while Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE jumped to another record.  Financials drove gains in Europe on the day, with the banking index .SX7P rising 0.6 percent.  \u201cMore than cyclicals we are looking for lower valued areas like banks, telecoms, energy,\u201d John Surplice, pan-European equities fund manager at Invesco Perpetual, said.  \u201cThe areas we are cautious on are the ones we would deem bond proxy sectors - regulated utilities, food and beverage, long duration assets that have been re-priced significantly during the crisis,\u201d Surplice added.   European autos .SXAP was the top-performing sector, up 1.4 percent, while every other sector traded in positive territory.  Shares in Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI), Peugeot (PEUP.PA) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) were among the biggest gainers, up 2.8 percent to 4.2 percent.     However, shares in British car insurer Admiral Group (ADML.L) tumbled around 5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX on the back of a downgrade from JPMorgan as well as some weak UK new car sales data.  Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) was another underperformer, down 4 percent after top customer Apple (AAPL.O) said that its products were hit by a chip flaw.

          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans on Friday downplayed the likelihood of a deal soon with Democrats on saving 700,000 young, undocumented U.S. immigrants from being kicked out of the country in March, a possibility created by President Donald Trump.  Trump in September ordered an Obama-era program that provided the young \u201cDreamer\u201d immigrants with work permits and prevented them from being deported to end in six months. The program is known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  Despite his order, the Republican president has vacillated in his view of the Dreamers. Young people brought to the United States as children illegally and raised and educated in the country, most of them have little or no experience of their parents\u2019 homelands in Latin America, Asia, Africa and elsewhere.  Saving the Dreamers is a high priority for Democrats, but the issue has been swept up in other debates, including one on the wall that Trump wants to build along the U.S.-Mexico border.  Republican Senator John Cornyn, in a tweet on Friday, accused Democrats of trying to force a deal on Dreamers by doing a \u201cslow walk\u201d on efforts to approve critical disaster aid and defense spending.  Two other Republicans late on Thursday said both sides remained far apart. \u201cOur discussions on border security and enforcement with Democrats are much further apart, and that is key to getting a bipartisan deal on DACA,\u201d senators Thom Tillis and James Lankford said in a statement.  Democrats have said they are open to tying DACA to additional funding for border security technology. But they oppose Trump\u2019s wall, projected to cost over $21 billion.  The struggle over the Dreamers carries political weight for both parties heading into the November 2018 midterm congressional elections. Most of the Dreamers came from Mexico and Hispanics tend to vote for Democrats, who hope to gain seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives.  Republican lawmakers met with Trump at the White House on Thursday and initially emerged saying they were optimistic that they could find a legislative fix for DACA.  On Friday and Saturday, Trump and senior Republican congressional leaders are also likely to discuss the issue at a conference held at Camp David, the U.S. president\u2019s mountain retreat in Maryland.  A meeting between leaders of both parties was set for Tuesday.  Cornyn, in an interview on Fox News on Friday, said Trump would demand that an immigration deal address the current visa lottery system and chain migration that unites family members.  \u201cThose are things that he\u2019s insisted upon,\u201d and Democrats would have to embrace them along with border security, said Cornyn.

Tehran\u2019s Friday prayer leader called on authorities to deal \u201cfirmly\u201d with those responsible for igniting over a week of demonstrations, in which 22 people were killed and more than 1,000 people were arrested, according to Iranian officials.  \u201cBut those ordinary Iranians who were deceived by these American-backed rioters should be dealt with based on Islamic clemency,\u201d cleric Ahmad Khatami told worshippers at Tehran university, TV reported.  Khatami also called on the government to \u201cpay more attention to people\u2019s economic problems.\u201d  Protests erupted on December 28 in the holy Shi\u2019ite city of Mashhad after the government announced plans to raise fuel prices and dismantle monthly cash handouts to lower-income Iranians.  Unrest spread to more than 80 cities and rural towns as thousands of young and working class Iranians voiced anger at graft, unemployment and a deepening gap between rich and poor.  Some 42,000 people took part in the unrest across the country, Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli was quoted as saying by state TV.  To try to allay tensions, the government suspended its planned fuel price hikes and cash handout cuts. Ali Rabiei, Iran\u2019s minister of cooperatives, labor and social welfare, said the government had plans to create over 900,000 jobs by March 2019, the state news agency IRNA reported on Friday.  The authorities have produced no evidence of a U.S. role in the demonstrations, which have lacked a unifying leader.  But in Moscow, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Iran\u2019s statements that external influences fomented the unrest were not groundless and that Washington used any possible method to destabilise governments it disliked.  He added that U.S. calls for an extraordinary meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss the turmoil in Iran interfered with the country\u2019s sovereignty, news agency Interfax said. The Council will meet on Friday at 3 p.m. (2000 GMT) to discuss Iran, Council president Kazakhstan has said.  Residents contacted by Reuters in various cities said the protests had shown sign of abating since Thursday, after the establishment intensified a crackdown on the protesters by dispatching Revolutionary Guards forces to several provinces.  Iran\u2019s elite Guards and its affiliated Basij militia suppressed the country\u2019s 2009 unrest over alleged election fraud, in which dozens of pro-reform Iranians were killed.  Iranian officials said the protests were the result of foreign instigation and mocked U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s support of protesters against what he called a \u201cbrutal and corrupt\u201d establishment.  \u201cEternal bedfellows #KSA (Saudi Arabia) and #ISIS (Islamic State) - following Trump\u2019s lead - all endorse violence, death and destruction in Iran. Why are we not surprised?\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Friday.  Last year Islamic State (IS) militants carried out their first attack in Tehran, killing 18 people in a country that backed offensives against the group in Syria and Iraq.  On Friday rallies, protesters chanted \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d, carrying pictures of Iran\u2019s top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and waved Iranian flags.  Television footage of rallies in several cities showed people chanting \u201cWe support Imam Khamenei ... We will not leave him alone in his fight against enemies\u201d.  \u201cDemonstrators demand the punishment of those behind foreign-linked riots which insulted religion and our authorities,\u201d state television reported, referring to unrest in which social media footage showed protesters tearing down pictures of Khamenei.  Hardline Khatami said the government should take more notice of Iranians\u2019 economic problems.  \u201cThere are workers who say they have not received their salaries for months ... These problems should be resolved,\u201d Khatami said, according to state TV.  Fearing that further unrest could undermine the Islamic republic altogether, Iran\u2019s faction-ridden political elite has displayed a united front.  But Khamenei and his hardline allies have criticised Rouhani for failing to revive the economy after most sanctions on Iran were lifted in 2016 under a deal reached between Tehran and major powers aimed at curbing the country\u2019s nuclear programme.  Rouhani secured the deal in 2015, raising hopes of better economic times among many Iranians, but discontent has since risen over the lack of broad improvement in living standards.

          "title": "Hungary's Richter expects Esmya drug ruling in first half: CEO",
          "body": "BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian drugmaker Richter expects European health inspectors to deliver a ruling on its Esmya medicine in the first half of 2018, its chief executive told Reuters, adding that uncertainty about the drug could delay earnings guidance.  In December the European Medicines Agency (EMA) opened a review into Esmya, used to treat non-cancerous tumors in the womb, after four reports of serious liver damage in patients treated with the drug, three of whom ended up needing liver transplants.  Richter has said its clinical data indicated no demonstrable link between liver damage and Esmya, one of its flagship products, which accounted for about 6 percent of revenues in the first nine months of 2017.  \u201cWe maintain the view that this is an effective and safe method of treatment for a wide population of patients,\u201d Chief Executive Gabor Orban said in an interview on Friday.  Asked whether the uncertainty, which sparked a sell-off in Richter\u2019s shares early last month, spilled over into sales of the medicine, Orban said it was too early to assess any fallout.  \u201cSales in the first eleven months (of 2017) were on track\u201d for the drug to reach its full-year revenue target of 85 million euros ($102 million), Orban said.  Orban said December sales data was generally \u201cdifficult to interpret,\u201d while he had seen no data for January yet.  Richter shares closed 1 percent higher at 6,735 forints ($26) on the Budapest Stock Exchange on Friday, having underperformed the blue-chip index over the past three months.  Orban said if current levels of uncertainty around Esmya persist, Richter, which makes gynecological, cardiovascular and central nervous system drugs, may not issue earnings guidance next month, as it usually does.  The last time that happened was in 2009, during the global financial crisis, when the company said the market environment was too unpredictable to give reliable forecasts.  \u201cWe will see what happens with the turnover of Esmya and the level of uncertainty in a month,\u201d Orban said. The EMA has said it would next discuss the issue in February.  Richter, which has a market capitalization of $4.8 billion and earns most of its revenue from exports, will publish fourth-quarter earnings on February 8. Orban said there were no further cases of liver damage since the inquiry was launched.  Asked about a worst-case scenario, Orban said as with any medicine, that would be health regulators withdrawing the registration of Esmya, adding that he saw \u201czero sign\u201d of that happening. \u201cThis is entirely unrealistic,\u201d he said.  Orban added that Richter, whose biggest markets are Russia and the European Union, had nearly 100 billion forints ($390 million) of cash to spend on acquisitions and while there were several possible targets, no deal was imminent.  The CEO also said the outcome of the Esmya probe would have no impact on dividend policy.  Reporting by Gergely Szakacs; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle"

          "body": "* U.S. economy adds 148,000 jobs in Dec vs est. 190,000  * Average hourly earnings rise 0.3 pct, in line with estimates  * Cisco rises after BofA Merrill Lynch slaps \u2018buy\u2019 rating  * Indexes up: Dow 0.19 pct, S&P 0.23 pct, Nasdaq 0.48 pct (Changes comment, adds details, updates prices)  By Sruthi Shankar  Jan 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s major indexes rose to record highs on Friday after weaker-than-expected U.S. job additions in December lifted hopes that the Federal Reserve would stick to its policy of gradual interest rate hikes in 2018.  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said, much lower than economists\u2019 expectation of 190,000.  However, the data pointed to a pick-up in monthly wage gains.  Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent in December after gaining 0.1 percent in the prior month. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent in November.  \u201cThe market is shrugging it off because it\u2019s not weak enough to detract the Fed from raising rates further. The modest rise in average hourly wage number should give the Fed some breathing room,\u201d said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager, SIT Fixed Income Advisors LLC, Minneapolis.  The odds of a March rate hike stood at 67.5 percent, according to CME Group\u2019s Fedwatch tool, nearly unchanged from before the release of the jobs report.  Wall Street has started 2018 on a strong note, continuing the momentum from 2017.  The S&P and the Nasdaq were on track to post their biggest weekly gains since Dec. 2016, and the Dow was set for its best weekly performance in a month.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than employment number that is to the weaker side (to bring the market lower),\u201d said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania.  At 10:46 a.m. ET (1546 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 46.83 points, or 0.19 percent, at 25,121.96.  The S&P 500 was up 6.26 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,730.25 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 34.07 points, or 0.48 percent, at 7,111.99.  Among the 11 major S&P sectors, energy was the biggest decliner, down 0.81 percent as oil prices pulled away from their 2015 highs on soaring U.S. production.  Exxon fell 1.3 percent and Chevron 0.8 percent and were the biggest drags in the sector.  The technology index\u2019s 0.77 percent gain led the advancers, on track to post its best weekly gains since Dec. 2016  A more than 1 percent rise in Microsoft, Apple and Google-parent Alphabet boosted the sector.  Francesca\u2019s Holdings tanked 20 percent after the women\u2019s apparel and accessories maker said it expected up to 17 percent decline in current-quarter same-store sales.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,472 to 1,231. On the Nasdaq, 1,672 issues rose and 1,082 fell.  Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj\nKalluvila"

          "body": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey\u2019s Interior Ministry removed the opposition mayor of Istanbul\u2019s Besiktas municipality from office on Thursday, accusing him of links to the 2016 attempted coup and corruption.  In a statement, it said police were investigating Murat Hazinedar\u2019s alleged links to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of masterminding the plot.  Hazinedar, a member of the secular main opposition Republic People Party (CHP), denies any link to Gulen. Gulen denies any involvement in the attempted coup.       At a news conference, Hazinedar called on President Tayyip Erdogan to \u201cget his hands off my family\u201d, after his wife and son were barred from traveling abroad due to the investigations.  The ministry said it had also removed two other members of the council in Besiktas, one of the largest municipalities in Turkey\u2019s biggest city of Istanbul.  The move against Hazinedar marked the second time the ministry has removed a CHP mayor from office since its chairman in November accused members of Erdogan\u2019s family of transferring $14 million to a company in the Isle of Man.  Erdogan denied and dismissed the accusations as lies, and has since taken CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu to court, saying he would \u201cpay the price\u201d.  Last year, Erdogan also called for the resignation of mayors in a purge of local politics leading six mayors to step down, including those of Istanbul and Ankara.

          "body": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Rapid advances by the Syrian army into rebels\u2019 largest remaining stronghold, Idlib province, have brought it closer to a key insurgent-held military airport and displaced tens of thousands of people struggling to find shelter in winter weather.   Supported by Iran-backed militias and Russian air power, President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces have taken territory in northeastern Hama and southern Idlib provinces since beginning an offensive in late October.  The fighting and air strikes have forced more than 60,000 people to leave their homes since Nov. 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).   In recent days the offensive has escalated, with forces progressing towards the strategic Abu al-Duhur military airport, to which rebels laid siege in 2012 before completely ousting Assad\u2019s forces in September 2015.   A commander in a military alliance fighting in support of Damascus has said the army and its allies intend to capture the air base.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday the Syrian army and its allies had taken around 84 villages since Oct. 22, including at least 14 in the past 24 hours.  The Britain-based war monitor said the rapid advance this week was made possible by intense air strikes which caused rebels to withdraw.  The Syrian army lost Idlib province, which borders Turkey, to insurgents when the provincial capital fell to insurgents in 2015. It became the only province fully under opposition control.     Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al-Qaeda\u2019s former branch in Syria formerly called the Nusra Front, is the main rebel force in the province.   A Syrian military source said the Nusra Front and its allies are the target of the military operation in northeast Hama and southeast Idlib provinces.  \u201cThe army\u2019s operations there are continuing and the army is achieving advances. The terrorists (are facing) big losses in the area,\u201d he told Reuters.  Idlib is part of Russian-engineered \u201cde-escalation zones\u201d meant to reduce fighting in western Syria. Turkish troops are also present in northern Idlib under the de-escalation deal struck with Assad\u2019s allies Russia and Iran.  \u201cDe-escalation zones do not cover the Nusra Front at all, and the Nusra Front is in reality the one fully controlling Idlib,\u201d the military source said.  Tahrir al-Sham is simultaneously under attack from Islamic State, which has been expanding a small pocket of territory in northeastern Hama on the edge of the Idlib enclave since the Syrian army ousted it from central Syria in October last year.   Mustafa al-Haj Yousef, head of Idlib\u2019s Civil Defence, rescuers who work in opposition-controlled areas of Syria, said: \u201cIf martyrs, the displaced, the injured, are on the rise, collapsing the houses, striking civilians, targeting civilians? It\u2019s as if there\u2019s no de-escalation.\u201d  DE-ESCALATION?  The United Nations said the situation of civilians newly displaced by the fighting in Idlib was \u201cdire\u201d, with humanitarian agencies struggling to meet their needs.  Yousef, of the Civil Defence, said that even after fleeing heavy frontline air strikes and shelling, people face an air campaign deeper inside the province.     He said there are not enough camps to cope with the flows, warning that if the army pushes up to Abu al-Duhur and beyond, \u201cthe displacement will double, it will multiply\u201d.   \u201cMost of them are sleeping on the ground, in tents that can\u2019t protect from the rain or the cold. Some people are able to rent, but the rent prices have also been very high.\u201d  Idlib has been a haven for tens of thousands of rebels and civilians forced to abandon their homes in other parts of western Syria that the government and its foreign military allies have recaptured.      It has also been the target of intensive Russian and Syrian air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians and destroyed hospitals and civil defense centers.  Communities and camps, already hosting thousands of displaced, are struggling to absorb new arrivals.   U.N. OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said that in Idlib province 55 percent of communities are overburdened. In around 10 percent of these communities, internally displaced persons make up more than 70 percent of the total population.  OCHA also said the fighting had forced some humanitarian organizations to stop work in parts of southern Idlib.   \u201cThe greatest need we\u2019re seeing among people struggling to survive in this part of Syria is for food. Having been displaced repeatedly by conflict, they\u2019ve exhausted their resources and are left with few choices, none of them good,\u201d said Christy Delafield of Mercy Corps, one of the largest organizations delivering aid in Syria.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look to us like things will get easier any time soon.\u201d  Reporting by Lisa Barrington and Ellen Francis in Beirut with additional reporting by Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Editing by Mark Heinrich"

          "body": "* FTSE 100, FTSE 250 hit new peaks  * Auto dealers and insurers fall on weak sales data  * Centrica, United Utilities lifted by CS upgrade (Adds closing prices)  By Helen Reid  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s main stock index and the mid-cap benchmark scaled new peaks on Friday, lifted by a wave of gains across equities worldwide, while a sharp fall in UK car sales hit some motor dealers and insurance stocks.  The FTSE 100 closed 0.4 percent higher at 7724.22 points after hitting a record of 7,727.7 around mid-session, boosted by miners, utilities and consumer staples stocks. Mid-caps in the FTSE 250 index also touched a new record, up 0.5 percent.  Still, the British market lagged bigger moves in European stocks after impressive economic data for the euro zone.  \u201cThe UK stock market and UK economy are quite starkly different,\u201d said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald, adding that he continued to expect lower equity returns from Britain than European and U.S. stocks.  Analysts have, however, begun turning more optimistic on FTSE 100 companies\u2019 earnings, revising up their estimates in the past two weeks as a commodities rally pushed the index higher.  Centrica and United Utilities led the leaderboard after Credit Suisse upgraded both stocks, revising up its view on the sector.  Analysts at the Swiss bank said the worst case for UK domestic energy suppliers was now priced in, and the stocks carried large risk discounts.  Motor insurers were the main laggards after car sales data showed the sharpest fall in new car registrations since 2009.  Admiral sank 2.9 percent to the bottom of the FTSE.  Admiral was doubly hit by both the car sales data and a downgrade to \u201cunderweight\u201d from JP Morgan.  A Mediobanca analyst said Admiral was heavily exposed to the UK car market, with nearly 100 percent of profits made domestically.  Some small-caps were also hit by the weaker sales data, with auto retailer Pendragon down 1.6 percent and Autotrader falling 0.5 percent.  Mid-cap stocks were helped to their record by strong industrials and tech shares. The more domestically focused stocks were shunned by investors after Brexit but some were being tempted back by lower valuations.  \u201cA lot of the domestic UK market has started to price in a weak economic outlook. We find some interest there to be honest,\u201d said John Surplice, pan-European fund manager at Invesco Perpetual.  \u201cWe have reflected that in our portfolio and got a bit more domestic UK exposure - but as a responsible pan-European investor you see the merits of some domestic UK stocks but you don\u2019t want to go overboard on it,\u201d he added.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two men spoke by phone on Thursday night for five to 10 minutes. Trump wanted to \u201cwish him well,\u201d the official said.  Tensions between Trump and Romney date back to the 2016 presidential election campaign when Romney appealed to establishment Republicans to reject Trump\u2019s candidacy, an effort that fizzled.  In late 2016 after Trump won the presidency, he briefly considered whether to pick Romney as his secretary of state but ultimately turned to Rex Tillerson for the job.  Trump had lobbied U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah to run for re-election in 2018 in what was viewed as an effort to prevent Romney from running for the seat.  But Hatch announced recently he would retire, opening the door to a Romney candidacy. Romney is a resident of Utah although he spends time at his California home as well.

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, January 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded MutRe's Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating to 'AA-' from 'A-' and removed the rating from Rating Watch Positive. The Outlook is Stable. The upgrade follows the completion of SCOR's acquisition of the 67% stake in MutRe's capital that it did not already own. KEY RATING DRIVERS SCOR announced on 4 January 2018 that it had finalised the acquisition of 100% of MutRe's shares. Fitch considers MutRe to be 'Core' to the SCOR group due to its strong position in SCOR's home market, its alignment with SCOR's 'Vision in Action' strategic plan and the integration between SCOR and MutRe with regards to IT systems and underwriting expertise. As a result, we are aligning MutRe's rating with that of SCOR's core operating entities at 'AA-'. MutRe holds a solid franchise in the French mutual life, accident and health reinsurance market, a market that Fitch views as core to SCOR's overall strategy. Fitch expects that MutRe will be fully integrated into SCOR's health and protection reinsurance operations in France. SCOR has been a 33% shareholder and a major technical and commercial partner of MutRe since MutRe was created in 1998.

          "title": "Second time lucky? Merkel starts over with coalition talks",
          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, weakened by an election setback in September, launches a second bid to build a coalition government on Sunday when she sits down with the Social Democrats (SPD) for exploratory talks.  A re-run of her \u2018grand coalition\u2019 with the SPD, in power from 2013 to 2017, appears the best option for conservative Merkel is as it would provide stability in what would be her fourth term.  But with success far from guaranteed, there are a range of other possible scenarios.  After her conservatives bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the Sept. 24 national election, Merkel saw her authority undermined two months later by the collapse of three-way coalition talks with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens.  That shifted her focus back to the SPD, but the center-left party is wary of another tie-up with Merkel after voters punished it for four years of power-sharing in the September vote, when its support slumped to its lowest level since 1933.   The consensus among politicians and commentators is that the talks will last at least until March.   Although the current caretaker government under Merkel is keeping things ticking over, investors fear that protracted talks will delay what they view as necessary reforms in Europe\u2019s biggest economy and the bloc as a whole.  After a flow of leaks, tweets and selfies emanating from last year\u2019s three-way coalition talks undermined trust, this time around participants have agreed to a news blackout during negotiations.   Here are the main scenarios:  The most likely outcome, given that the two camps have ruled together for eight of the 12 years Merkel has been chancellor and broadly agree on foreign and security policy. However, with both blocs struggling to stem a fall in support, it is by no means a done deal.  They are at odds on a range of issues, from tax to healthcare and Europe. The SPD wants a wholesale reform of health insurance to end what it describes as a two-tier system. Conservatives oppose this idea and are more skeptical than the SPD on plans for deeper EU integration.   Migrant policy is likely to be one of the trickiest issues as Germany struggles to integrate the more than 1.6 million asylum seekers who have arrived since the start of 2015.   Bavaria\u2019s Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party to Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU), has called for benefit cuts for asylum seekers and wants limits on family members joining refugees in Germany - anathema to the SPD.     Offering the greatest degree of stability, this tie-up is Merkel\u2019s favored option but many SPD members are wary. The party had promised to go into opposition after its worst election result since 1933.  The SPD leadership, worried about internal splits, seems certain to make tough demands and has stressed that the outcome of talks is open. It is offering members a vote on Jan. 21 after \u2018exploratory\u2019 talks before leaders start official coalition negotiations.   \u2018KOKO\u2019 COOPERATION DEAL BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES, SPD  Mooted by skeptics of a grand coalition in the SPD, the center-left party would work with Merkel in some areas including the budget and European and foreign affairs but force her to find ad-hoc parliamentary majorities for other policies.    While this is more palatable to many SPD members, many senior conservatives have rejected the idea outright, rendering it unlikely.   This would be a post-war first for a country that craves political stability - a result of the fragmentation in the years that preceded the rise of Hitler\u2019s Nazi party.  Nevertheless, some Social Democrats prefer this option, which would allow them to oppose Merkel\u2019s policies and force her to seek parliamentary majorities on individual laws. It would also be likely to hasten the end of her political career.   Some conservatives, including Merkel, have said they would prefer new elections to a minority government.   This scenario would also throw Merkel\u2019s future into doubt. She has indicated she could stand again and, while the absence of an obvious successor makes her the most likely candidate, her personal ratings are on the wane.  As far as the parties go, opinion polls indicate there have been no big swings since the September election. A GMS survey this week put the conservative bloc on 32 percent, unchanged from the previous week, the SPD was down 1 point at 20 percent and AfD up 1 point at 14 percent.  Germany\u2019s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who would have to get involved if no coalition deal was agreed, has made clear he wants to avoid new elections if possible.  \u2018JAMAICA\u2019 COALITION OF CONSERVATIVES, FDP, GREENS   There is little appetite for a re-run of talks on this nationally untested three-way alliance, dubbed \u2018Jamaica\u2019 because the parties\u2019 colors match those of the Jamaican flag.  Divergences on policies from Europe to tax and migration were clear during the weeks of talks that descended into acrimony last year before collapsing.  However, some in the FDP - which was responsible for the breakdown of talks in November - have left the door open to another try if all other efforts at forming a government fail.   Some experts have pointed to the possibility of an alliance between the conservatives and Greens - easier to agree than a three-way deal with the FDP. This could get a degree of backing on some policies from the SPD. However, this seems an unlikely option and would be unstable.  Reporting by Madeline Chambers; editing by John Stonestreet"

          "title": "UPDATE 3-Greek yields hit 12-year low as bailout exit beckons",
          "body": "* German 10-year yield at one-week low after US payroll data  * Greece\u2019s 10-year government bond yields reach 3.77 pct  * Country expected to exit bailout in August  * Euro zone yields lower on inflation data (Updates prices)  By Abhinav Ramnarayan  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Greece\u2019s 10-year borrowing costs dropped to their lowest in 12 years on Friday, benefiting from expectations it will exit its bailout this year, underpinned by risk appetite and a tentative economic recovery.  Greece and its creditors in the euro zone reached a preliminary agreement last month that paves the way for the country to exit the latest rescue package - its third since 2010 - in August.  That would cap a slowly strengthening recovery eight years, after Greece came close to defaulting on its debt and risked being kicked out of the single currency bloc.  Last year, the country returned to bond markets, raising hopes that it can again become financially independent.  \u201cGreece\u2019s fundamentals have been on the mend and investors have been looking at the yield pick-up they get from investing in that debt,\u201d said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.  \u201cAlso, a rising tide lifts all boats - with the euro zone economy doing so well, it\u2019s a very \u2018risk on\u2019 environment and that is benefiting Greece.\u201d  Greek manufacturing activity kept expanding in December as new orders grew at the fastest pace in over nine years, leading companies to increase hiring and production, a survey showed on Tuesday.  Having been among the best performing government bond assets in the euro zone in 2017, the yield on 10-year Greek government bonds dropped to its lowest level since February 2006 at 3.77 percent on Friday.  Short-dated Greek debt yields were also at multi-year lows: the country\u2019s two-year borrowing costs fell to 1.47 percent and is now lower than the equivalent U.S. Treasury yield.  But despite that vote of confidence, engineering a clean bailout break remains a challenge.  \u201cThe fact that EU creditors still hold over 80 percent of (Greek) debt will mean that they insist on continued austerity and reforms,\u201d said Jennifer McKeown, an chief European economist at Capital Economics.  \u201cThese conditions will be very difficult for Greece to meet as the electorate struggles with high unemployment ... perhaps leading to a replay of the 2015 referendum (on bailout conditions).\u201d  A messy default and euro zone exit still could not be ruled out, she said.  Most other euro zone government bonds yields were flat to lower, after data on Friday showed that euro zone inflation was 1.4 percent in December, well below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just below 2 percent.  Debt yields in southern Europe \u2014 considered more dependent on ECB largesse - dropped 2 to 3 bps .  The yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year government bond , the benchmark for the euro zone, hit a one-week low of 0.42 percent after data showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in December. It inched back to 0.44 percent in late trades.  Reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan & Fanny Potkin; editing by\nJohn Stonestreet/Keith Weir"

          "title": "Can living near a gym make you slimmer?",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - People who live close to gyms, pools and playing fields weigh less and have smaller waistlines than their counterparts residing farther away from exercise facilities, a UK study suggests.   Living far away from fast food outlets also appeared to help people maintain a lower weight and trimmer waist, although this connection wasn\u2019t as strong as the proximity of gyms, researchers report in the Lancet Public Health.   \u201cIt is likely that communities without the neighborhood resources needed to encourage a healthy lifestyle put their residents at a higher risk of obesity,\u201d said senior study author Steven Cummins of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  \u201cThis could be improved by restricting the number of new fast food outlets in a neighborhood and how close they can be to people\u2019s homes, incentivizing operators of physical activity facilities to open in residential areas with few facilities, or funding local authorities to provide such facilities,\u201d Cummins said by email.   Globally, more than 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese, according to the World Health Organization. The condition contributes to a variety of common medical problems including heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers.   For the study, researchers examined data on weight, waist measurements and body fat for more than 400,000 men and women ranging in age from 40 to 70.   The study used data collected between 2006 and 2010 that included demographic characteristics like household income, as well as what types of eating and exercising options were available near people\u2019s home addresses.   To determine exercise opportunities, researchers looked for indoor and outdoor facilities for sports and leisure activities such as gyms, swimming pools and playing fields. They didn\u2019t consider public parks or cycling and walking paths.   On average, people had just one exercise facility within 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) of home. And almost one-third of participants had no options this close to where they lived, the study found.   People typically had to travel just 1.1 kilometers (0.68 miles) to reach a fast food outlet. Nearly one in five people had a fast food restaurant within a half-kilometer (0.31 miles) of home.   Better access to exercise options translated into a healthier weight.   Compared to people who had no facilities near home, people who had at least six places to work out weighed less, had a 1.22 centimeter (0.47 inch) slimmer waistline, and had a body fat percentage that was 0.81 percent lower on average.   At the same time, people who lived at least 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) from a fast food outlet had a waistline 0.26 centimeters (0.10 inches) smaller than individuals who lived less than a half-kilometer away, the study also found.   One limitation of the study is that not all fast food restaurants may have been included in the database, the authors note. The study also didn\u2019t account for the proximity of healthy dining establishments near home, or the type of food and workout options close to where people worked.   The study was not a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how neighborhood characteristics like the availability of gyms or greasy spoons might impact obesity rates.   It\u2019s hard to rule out the possibility that healthier people may choose to live near the amenities they need to stay healthy, said Pablo Monsivais, author of an accompanying editorial and a nutrition and exercise researcher at Washington State University in Spokane.   But the study still suggests that where we live matters, Monsivais said by email.   \u201cIndividually, each of us makes choices that affect whether we maintain a healthy weight or put on pounds, but these choices are shaped by the environments we inhabit,\u201d Monsivais added. \u201cThis study looked at just a few features of the environment, but research shows that things like green space, walkability, noise, air quality and the availability of healthy food choices all seem to matter for our health and body weight.\u201d  SOURCES: bit.ly/2lXj03d and bit.ly/2CKG7IV Lancet Public Health, online December 12, 2017."

          "body": "(Corrects record FTSE index level in second paragraph)  * FTSE 100, FTSE 250 hit new peaks  * Auto dealers and insurers fall on weak sales data  * Centrica, United Utilities lifted by CS upgrade  By Helen Reid  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s main stock index and the mid-cap benchmark hit new peaks on Friday, lifted by a wave of gains across equities worldwide, while a sharp fall in UK car sales hit some motor dealers and insurance stocks.  The FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent to hit a record of 7,727.7 points around mid-session, boosted by miners, utilities and consumer staples stocks. Mid-caps in the FTSE 250 index also touched a new record, up 0.1 percent.  The blue-chip index was on track for its smallest weekly gains in five weeks, though, as the British market lagged bigger moves in European stocks after impressive economic data for the euro zone.  \u201cThe UK stock market and UK economy are quite starkly different,\u201d said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald, adding that he continued to expect lower equity returns from the Britain than European and U.S. stocks.  Analysts have, however, begun turning more optimistic on FTSE 100 companies\u2019 earnings, revising up their estimates in the past two weeks as a commodities rally pushed the index higher.  Glencore, BHP Billiton, and Anglo American delivered the strongest boost to the FTSE as metals prices held on to their gains after a stellar rally.  Centrica and United Utilities led the leaderboard after Credit Suisse upgraded both stocks, revising up its view on the sector.  Analysts at the Swiss bank said the worst case for UK domestic energy suppliers was now priced in, and the stocks carried large risk discounts.  Motor insurers were the main laggards after car sales data showed the sharpest fall in new car registrations since 2009.  Admiral sank 4.7 percent to the bottom of the FTSE, while Direct Line fell 0.9 percent.  Admiral was doubly hit by both the car sales data and a downgrade to \u201cunderweight\u201d from JP Morgan.  A Mediobanca analyst said Admiral was the most exposed to the UK car market, with nearly 100 percent of profits made domestically, while Direct Line also drew nearly 50 percent of its premiums from personal motor insurance.  Some small-caps were also hit by the weaker sales data, with auto retailer Pendragon down 3.8 percent and dealership chain Lookers dropping 3.2 percent.  Mid-cap stocks were helped to their record by strong industrials and tech shares. The more domestically focused stocks were shunned by investors after Brexit but some were being tempted back by lower valuations.  \u201cA lot of the domestic UK market has started to price in a weak economic outlook. We find some interest there to be honest,\u201d said John Surplice, pan-European fund manager at Invesco Perpetual.  \u201cWe have reflected that in our portfolio and got a bit more domestic UK exposure - but as a responsible pan-European investor you see the merits of some domestic UK stocks but you don\u2019t want to go overboard on it,\u201d he added.

Citigroup provided committed financing for the acquisition.  High-yield bonds could also back Swiss vending machine operator Selecta\u2019s potential acquisition of Italian vending and coffee service provider Gruppo Argenta, according to two high-yield bankers.  An entity controlled by Selecta\u2019s majority shareholder KKR will acquire Argenta. Selecta has the right to acquire Argenta directly from its private equity owner Motion Equity Partners, or after the acquisition is completed.  This is the latest acquisition for Selecta, which acquired Pelican Rouge in March 2017 with a \u20ac180m capital injection from KKR. This helped the issuer\u2019s outstanding bonds\u2019 performance, which once struggled as weakness in the vending machine sector fuelled concerns around liquidity.  Selecta, Argenta and Motion Equity Partners did not respond to requests for comment.  Paper and label producer Fedrigoni will also take to the high-yield market to back its takeover by Bain Capital, according to a banker on the deal. Fedrigoni, which was privately owned prior to the acquisition, will be a debut issuer in leveraged finance markets.  BNP Paribas, HSBC, UBI Banca and KKR will be the joint bookrunners on the associated financing, according to a statement from Bain Capital.  There are more M&A-related deals in the pipeline, including for Pure Gym\u2019s buyout by Leonard Green & Partners, for Lowell\u2019s takeover of several businesses of peer Lindorff, and for Unilever\u2019s sale of its margarine and spreads business.  The financing backing the sale of Akzo Nobel\u2019s speciality chemicals business could also include high-yield bonds.  M&A-related issuance in euros and sterling hit US$10.8bn-equivalent in 2017, its highest level ever, according to IFR data. But, with the vast majority of last year\u2019s high-yield deals refinancing existing bonds, M&A trades did little to rebalance the market\u2019s supply and demand. But that has the potential to improve this year.  \u201cI think the M&A refinancing split may balance out a bit more,\u201d the first banker said.

          "body": "DETROIT (Reuters) - North American orders for Class 8 semi-trucks jumped 77 percent in December compared with the same period in 2016, for a 77 percent full-year surge in truck sales in 2017, FTR, a company that tracks the industry, said on Friday.  A strong road freight market should continue to fuel truck production in 2018, FTR said.  Preliminary orders in the United States, Canada and Mexico for the big rigs that haul freight along North American highways hit 37,200, up significantly from around 21,000 in December 2016, according to FTR.  This was the third consecutive month truck orders have passed the 30,000 mark.   Full-year 2017 orders for Class 8 trucks came in at 290,000 units, FTR said, compared with the 164,000 big rigs that truck companies ordered in 2016. The United States is by far the largest market in North America.  Truck order growth in 2018 could be further boosted by a federal mandate that truck firms switch to electronic logs (ELDs) from paper logs. That mandate went into effect in mid-December.   Experts predict many smaller truck companies that fudge the books in order to stay profitable in a low-margin industry will close up shop, benefiting larger companies and driving up demand for new vehicles.  \u201cOur forecast continues to call for an increase in production for 2018, but market expectations are varied for 2019,\u201d FTR Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Starks said in a statement.  The main truck makers in the U.S. market are Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Navistar International Corp (NAV.N), PACCAR Inc (PCAR.O) and Volvo AB (VOLVb.ST).  FTR said orders in December were spread unevenly among truck manufacturers, but said no single company \u201cis showing any significant weakness in order activity.\u201d   Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Jonathan Oatis"

          "body": "* World shares continue push higher  * Dollar up after U.S. jobs report  * Zinc prices highest in decade (Updates to U.S. trading open; changes byline, dateline, previously LONDON)  By Stephanie Kelly  NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - World shares continued their strong start to 2018, with Wall Street opening up and European stocks advancing, while the U.S. dollar reversed its losses against the euro after a brief dip following the U.S. jobs report.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.45 percent, reaching a fresh record high on the day.  Throughout the first week of 2018, world shares have risen and several benchmarks have broken records. With the world\u2019s largest economies all growing healthily at once and central banks moving slowly to tighten policy, investors have poured money into risk assets.  U.S. stocks advanced on Friday as investors looked past weaker-than-expected U.S. job gains in December and focused on signs of a pick-up in wage growth.  Non-farm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month, while economists had expected a rise of 190,000. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent, compared to 0.1 percent in November.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.05 points, or 0.36 percent, to 25,165.18, the S&P 500 gained 10.18 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,734.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.90 points, or 0.63 percent, to 7,122.82.  \u201cDecember\u2019s non-farm payrolls data does not fit the current narrative of booming U.S. growth. The initial reaction from the market is to ignore. That could be perilous,\u201d said Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform Infinox in London, in a note.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index gained 0.77 percent, and emerging market stocks rose 0.65 percent.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.7 percent higher, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 0.89 percent.  The U.S. dollar rose on Friday, after a brief dip, after investors decided the U.S. December non-farm payrolls report would not stop the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates multiple times this year.  \u201cIt was a little disappointing. The market doesn\u2019t care. The margin of error on this number is always big,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, referring to the U.S. jobs data.  \u201cWhat we\u2019d be concerned about is if we see a couple of prints below 100,000. Until then we\u2019re okay,\u201d he added.  The dollar index last rose 0.15 percent, with the euro down 0.27 percent to $1.2034.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.41 percent at 113.23 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3564, up 0.10 percent on the day.  Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.4763 percent, from 2.453 percent late on Thursday.  The 30-year bond last fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.8144 percent, from 2.786 percent late on Thursday.  Oil prices fell on Friday, with U.S. production soaring. Earlier in the week, prices climbed to highs last seen in 2015, boosted by tightening supply and political tensions in OPEC member Iran.  U.S. crude fell 1.34 percent to $61.18 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.40, down 0.98 percent on the day.  In commodities, zinc hit its highest in more than a decade as concerns over market tightness continued. Three-month zinc on the London Metal Exchange was last bid at $3,366.

But his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel, who will host Cavusoglu for talks in his hometown of Goslar in central Germany on Saturday, made clear Turkey must first release a German-Turkish journalist detained for more than a year without charge.  \u201cBoth sides have an interest in a new start in the bilateral relationship as we live in a time full of challenges,\u201d Cavusoglu wrote in a column for Germany\u2019s Funke media group of newspapers. \u201cIt is not the time for bullhorn diplomacy.\u201d  His comments underlined Turkey\u2019s desire to mend fences with Germany, its biggest trade partner and an important NATO ally, after a series of disputes, including over Ankara\u2019s large-scale crackdown on suspected supporters of a failed 2016 coup.

Turkey says the crackdown, targeting alleged supporters of a Muslim network it blames for the coup, is necessary on security grounds. Ankara has criticized Germany\u2019s refusal to hand over asylum seekers it says were involved in the failed putsch.  Cavusoglu said improved ties would allow the two countries to work more closely in areas including security and trade.  He said trade between Germany and Turkey amounted to 174 billion euros  ($209.91 billion) in the last five years, with major opportunities in the coming decade from big infrastructure projects, in particular in transport and renewable energy.  Cavusoglu also stressed Turkey\u2019s role in stemming a wave of migrants to Germany under a deal with the European Union in 2016 and said he hoped the EU would live up to its commitments to make it easier for Turks to get visas to visit the bloc.

          "body": "BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Inflation in the euro zone slowed as expected in December, vindicating the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to keep its policy easy despite growing pressure from Germany and other richer euro zone countries.  The ECB has said it would continue buying bonds at least until September and keep rates low well after to raise inflation to its two percent target. But policymakers from the Netherlands, Germany and other northern countries have voiced their worries about an overly easy policy while economic growth is strong.  Prices in the euro zone grew by just 1.4 percent year on year last month, or 10 basis points slower than in the previous month due to smaller increases in food and energy prices. Once those components are stripped out, so called \u201ccore\u201d inflation was stable at 1.1 percent.  \u201cThere is no great pressure on the ECB to unwind QE,\u201d Kenneth Broux, a market strategist at Societe Generale, said.  The slight deceleration in headline inflation had been expected by the ECB and by market economists polled by Reuters.  But a stronger-than-expected German inflation reading of 1.6 percent last week raised market speculation about an upside surprise in euro zone price growth on Friday.  After the data the euro EUR= traded just below a four-month high of $1.2089 hit on Thursday, consolidating a rally that may prove a headache to the ECB by making euro zone imports cheaper and exports dearer.   \u201cThe euro is not helping above $1.20 because it should delay inflation returning to target,\u201d Societe Generale\u2019s Broux said.  The ECB is due to hold its next policy meeting on Jan 25 and investors will look for any sign of discomfort with the euro\u2019s strength in Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference.

          "body": "OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Expectations that Canada\u2019s central bank will boost interest rates later this month for the third time since July surged on Friday as the government reported jobs data significantly above analysts\u2019 expectations.  Statistics Canada on Friday reported 78,600 new positions in December, smashing analysts\u2019 expectations of a modest 1,000 jobs gain. The jobless rate dipped to a 41-year low of 5.7 percent.  \u201cIt\u2019s a spectacular year in terms of employment,\u201d said Stefane Marion, chief economist, at National Bank Financial. \u201cI think there\u2019s a rate hike in January. You\u2019re either data-dependant or you\u2019re not.\u201d  Marion was one of five economists or strategists who told Reuters that they either expect a hike at the next Bank of Canada rate-setting meeting on Jan. 17, or that prospects for an increase have increased.   Money market data showed that the chances of a rate increase this month have nearly doubled to 65 percent. BOCWATCH  The Canadian dollar quickly jumped on the news, trading as high as C$1.2355 to the U.S. dollar, up from C$1.2505, before the data release. Canada\u2019s 2-year yield surged to 1.786 percent, its highest rate since June 2011.  The central bank has said that it would by guided by incoming data and that it was increasingly confident the economy would need less stimulus over time. It raised rates for the first time in seven years in July and then again in September. Its benchmark interest rate sits at 1 percent.  \u201cToday\u2019s figures should be massive catalysts for the Canadian dollar\u201d said Nick Exarhos, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, who also expects the central bank to raise rates this month and said the numbers could help push up short-term interest rates in Canada.      Part-time employment in December jumped by 54,900 jobs, while 23,700 full-time positions were added. On a year-over-year basis, employment increased by 422,500, or 2.3 percent, the most since November 2007.  Separately, Statscan said Canada\u2019s trade deficit grew to C$2.54 billion ($2.05 billion) in November from C$1.55 billion in October as imports posted their biggest surge in more than eight years.      The central bank has long fretted about the export sector, which did well in November as shipments of goods rose by 3.7 percent, the most in a year.  But this was overshadowed by a 5.8 percent increase in imports, the most since a 7.8 percent leap seen in July 2009.

          "body": "OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Expectations that Canada\u2019s central bank will boost interest rates later this month for the third time since July surged on Friday as the government reported jobs data significantly above analysts\u2019 expectations.  Statistics Canada on Friday reported 78,600 new positions in December, smashing analysts\u2019 expectations of a modest 1,000 jobs gain. The jobless rate dipped to a 41-year low of 5.7 percent.  \u201cIt\u2019s a spectacular year in terms of employment,\u201d said Stefane Marion, chief economist, at National Bank Financial. \u201cI think there\u2019s a rate hike in January. You\u2019re either data-dependant or you\u2019re not.\u201d  Marion was one of five economists or strategists who told Reuters that they either expect a hike at the next Bank of Canada rate-setting meeting on Jan. 17, or that prospects for an increase have increased.   Money market data showed that the chances of a rate increase this month have nearly doubled to 65 percent. BOCWATCH  The Canadian dollar quickly jumped on the news, trading as high as C$1.2355 to the U.S. dollar, up from C$1.2505, before the data release. Canada\u2019s 2-year yield surged to 1.786 percent, its highest rate since June 2011.  The central bank has said that it would by guided by incoming data and that it was increasingly confident the economy would need less stimulus over time. It raised rates for the first time in seven years in July and then again in September. Its benchmark interest rate sits at 1 percent.  \u201cToday\u2019s figures should be massive catalysts for the Canadian dollar\u201d said Nick Exarhos, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, who also expects the central bank to raise rates this month and said the numbers could help push up short-term interest rates in Canada.      Part-time employment in December jumped by 54,900 jobs, while 23,700 full-time positions were added. On a year-over-year basis, employment increased by 422,500, or 2.3 percent, the most since November 2007.  Separately, Statscan said Canada\u2019s trade deficit grew to C$2.54 billion ($2.05 billion) in November from C$1.55 billion in October as imports posted their biggest surge in more than eight years.      The central bank has long fretted about the export sector, which did well in November as shipments of goods rose by 3.7 percent, the most in a year.  But this was overshadowed by a 5.8 percent increase in imports, the most since a 7.8 percent leap seen in July 2009.

          "body": "DETROIT (Reuters) - North American orders for Class 8 semi-trucks jumped 77 percent in December compared with the same period in 2016, for a 77 percent full-year surge in truck sales in 2017, FTR, a company that tracks the industry, said on Friday.  A strong road freight market should continue to fuel truck production in 2018, FTR said.  Preliminary orders in the United States, Canada and Mexico for the big rigs that haul freight along North American highways hit 37,200, up significantly from around 21,000 in December 2016, according to FTR.  This was the third consecutive month truck orders have passed the 30,000 mark.   Full-year 2017 orders for Class 8 trucks came in at 290,000 units, FTR said, compared with the 164,000 big rigs that truck companies ordered in 2016. The United States is by far the largest market in North America.  Truck order growth in 2018 could be further boosted by a federal mandate that truck firms switch to electronic logs (ELDs) from paper logs. That mandate went into effect in mid-December.   Experts predict many smaller truck companies that fudge the books in order to stay profitable in a low-margin industry will close up shop, benefiting larger companies and driving up demand for new vehicles.  \u201cOur forecast continues to call for an increase in production for 2018, but market expectations are varied for 2019,\u201d FTR Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Starks said in a statement.  The main truck makers in the U.S. market are Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Navistar International Corp (NAV.N), PACCAR Inc (PCAR.O) and Volvo AB (VOLVb.ST).  FTR said orders in December were spread unevenly among truck manufacturers, but said no single company \u201cis showing any significant weakness in order activity.\u201d   Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Jonathan Oatis"

          "body": "KIEV (Reuters) - A court temporarily suspended the powers of Moldova\u2019s President Igor Dodon on Friday, paving the way for parliament to bypass his veto and enact a law that would restrict Russian TV broadcasts as foreign propaganda.

          "title": "Data machine cranks back into high gear for 2018",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Data in the week ahead will enable investors to gauge the strength of German and British industry, U.S. spending and Chinese trade at the end of last year - and the first hints on the strength of economic activity at the start of 2018.  The German economy has been firing on all cylinders in recent months, with consumption, state spending and rising exports driving growth in both industry and services.  With interest rates low and the labour market performing well, the economy has so far weathered the political impasse resulting from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s failure to form a government since an election in September. She launches coalition talks on Sunday with the Social Democrats, her partners from the 2013-17 administration.   Industrial orders have been strong in recent months, suggesting this sector of Europe\u2019s biggest economy should gain steam at the start of 2018, although actual output has unexpectedly slipped following a more than six-year high hit in August.  Analysts at HSBC think that imbalance is likely to have rectified itself to some degree in November, and they forecast a hefty rise in output in particular.  \u201cWe expect the order level to be unchanged in November after having risen in the three consecutive months,\u201d they wrote in a note to investors. That would undercut the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.5 percent rise in orders.  But HSBC expects production to have rebounded by 2.2 percent month on month in November, outstripping the Reuters consensus call for 1.8 percent.  The German orders data is due out on Monday, with output figures to follow on Tuesday.  By contrast, British industrial output has been buoyant, expanding in October at its fastest annual pace in almost a year. While the economy has lost momentum as sterling\u2019s tumble after the Brexit vote sent inflation climbing, some exporters have gained from the weaker pound and the rebound in the euro zone economy.  \u201cWhile actual manufacturing output may not be as strong as ... surveys suggest, the uniformly sharp pick-up reported by them implies growth has been decent in November,\u201d analysts at Investec wrote in a note.  \u201cAdditional support may come from utilities output as temperatures dropped to more typical seasonal levels after a particularly mild October.\u201d  Investec sees industrial production rising 0.8 percent on the month, more than double the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.3 percent pickup. The data is due out on Wednesday.  There are no major central bank decisions due in the coming week.  The broader outlook for both Germany and Britain depends to some extent on the performance of the world\u2019s two behemoth economies, the United States and China, where economic growth has been met with gradually tightening monetary policies.  U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, has been supported by steady wage gains as the labour market tightens, potentially paving the way for more Federal Reserve interest rate hikes this year.  In November, retail sales across the country increased more than expected. Analysts at HSBC suggested the reading for December, due out on Friday, may show a slightly less frantic pace of shopping as Christmas approached.  Analysts polled by Reuters on average expect sales to have risen 0.5 percent month on month, slowing down from November\u2019s 0.8 percent gain.  Thanks to strong global demand, consumers lapped up Chinese goods at a rapid rate last year, giving the economy a boost and providing policymakers with room to tighten rules to curb high-risk lending.  In November, exports and imports both unexpectedly accelerated, but analysts expect growth to continue cooling amid a government crackdown on financial risks and polluting factories.  Data for December is expected to show growth in both exports and imports eased somewhat last month, according to the consensus view of analysts polled by Reuters - but staying in or near double-digit percentages.  This version of the story refiles to correct spelling of \"week\" in the lede paragraph."

          "body": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Slightly fewer than half as many migrants reached Europe by sea in 2017 than 2016, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Friday, with curbs finally cutting traffic on the deadly route from Libya to Italy.  Two years after more than a million people entered the EU, mostly fleeing war in the Middle East and poverty in Africa, the IOM recorded 171,635 arrivals by boat in 2017. The 2016 figure was 363,504.  The biggest influx of refugees and migrants in Europe since World War Two caused a political and humanitarian crisis two years ago.  Since then, the main Eastern Mediterranean route between Turkey and Greece has largely been shut by a deal between the EU and Ankara.  Reducing traffic has been slower on the other main route, across the central Mediterranean from North Africa to Italy, where thousands of people have died at sea. But numbers finally started coming down sharply in the second half of last year.  Arrivals by boat in Italy accounted for most of the 2017 arrivals: 119,310 in total, down by a third compared to the previous year, the Italian Interior Ministry said on Dec 31.  \u201cWe can tell you with confidence that the numbers from North Africa to Italy this year are under 120,000...That\u2019s the lowest in the last four years for arrivals in Italy,\u201d IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a news briefing.  \u201cThe same can be said for the arrivals in Greece with 29,595 for 2017, absolutely the lowest in the four years we have been keeping numbers on Greece,\u201d he said. In 2016, some 173,614 migrants arrived by sea in Greece, according to IOM figures.  Some 21,663 migrants arrived in Spain as of Dec. 28 last year, while 1,067 landed in Cyprus, preliminary figures show.  More patrols and rescues off the coast of Libya, as well as fighting between smuggling groups, contributed to the overall drop, Millman said.  The number of migrant deaths at sea has not been finalised, but stands at 3,116, compared to 5,143 recorded in 2016, Millman said.  \u201cWe think of those as extremely positive developments,\u201d he said.  African migrants in Libya continue to depart for Europe from the coast, where the IOM is monitoring rescues, he said, adding: \u201cBoats are still rescuing in the hundreds every day, depending on the day, sub-Saharan Africans who have come through Libya.\u201d  Nearly 20,000 Africans went home last year under IOM\u2019s voluntary repatriation program from Libya, including 7,000 since an African Union - European Union agreement reached in Abidjan on Nov. 29, Millman said.  The United Nations agency aims to repatriate a further 15,000 migrants from Libya by the end of January, he told Reuters.  Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Peter Graff"

          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in December amid a decline in retail employment, but a pick-up in monthly wage gains pointed to labor market strength that could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in March.  * Total payrolls rose 148,000 vs 190,000 estimate and upwardly revised 252,000 prior (original 228,000)* Private payrolls rose 146,000 vs 185,000 estimate and upwardly revised 239,000 prior (original 221,000)  * Unemployment rate unchanged at 4.1 pct vs 4.1 pct estimate      * Average hourly earnings rise 0.3 pct month-to-month vs 0.3 pct estimate and downwardly revised 0.1 pct prior (original 0.2 pct)  * Average hourly earnings rise 2.5 pct year-over-year vs downwardly revised 2.4 pct prior (original 2.5 pct)  * U-6 rate pct rises to 8.1 pct vs 8.0 pct prior* Labor force participation unchanged at 62.7 pct   * Household survey: Workforce grew by 64,000; employed rose by 104,000; unemployed fell by 40,000      BRYCE DOTY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SIX FIXED INCOME ADVISORS LLC, MINNEAPOLIS:  \u201cThe\u00a0 most dire aspect of the report is the loss of retail jobs over the holiday season. We might see record losses in traditional retail jobs in the first quarter with more closings of brick and mortar stores. The market is shrugging it off because it\u2019s not weak enough to detract the Fed from raising rates further. The modest rise in average hourly wage number should give the Fed some breathing room.   \u201cThe market thinks this number is not super relevant because this was before tax reform, related salary increases and bonuses. We could see some traction in wage inflation in the next three to six months. I thought the yield curve would flatten more with the miss in the payrolls and the 30-year yield coming down on relatively muted wage inflation number. The response is so muted with investors wary of what\u2019s to come. We could see yields up by the end of day if we see a strong ISM services number.\u201d   PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO:  \u201cIt was a little disappointing. The market doesn\u2019t care. The margin of error on this number is always big.\u201d   \u201cI don\u2019t see it as all that bad. What we\u2019d be concerned about is if we see a couple of prints below 100,00. Until then we\u2019re ok.\u201d \u201cEmployment and the market should be good through the end of the first quarter and maybe the first half. It\u2019s going to be a tale of two years. The second half is going to be tough because of rougher earnings comparisons.\u201d  JIM VOGEL, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, FTN FINANCIAL, MEMPHIS:  \u201cThe jobs numbers at 148,000 for December were below the lowest estimates out of the group of 75 or so that were posted. But the solid metrics posted in both unemployment and in average hourly earnings growth have kept the market largely in line. Bond yields were most vulnerable to an upside surprise, not quite as reactive to a downside surprise because we have under-reacted to previous good news, including good auto sales in December relative to expectations, considering the ISM manufacturing numbers, considering the Chicago purchasing all the way back last week, so we had more room for rates to increase if the numbers were 210,000 or 225,000 this morning.\u201d  \u201cWage growth saw a modest pickup but we kept the yield, the year increase at 2.5 percent, which is still well on the low side of what you would anticipate if the Fed\u2019s core theory about increasing jobs forcing employers to raise wages were operational right now.\u201d   MARK MCCORMICK, NORTH AMERICAN HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, TD SECURITIES, TORONTO:  \u201cPretty soggy data across the board. We think this could reduce the chances of a March hike and further put pressure on the dollar. So we see a U.S. rate hike in June instead and just two rate increases instead of the three that the Fed expects. The dollar has not been getting any support from recent positive news because global growth is expanding.\u201d  AARON KOHLI, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK:  \u201cDecember payrolls disappointed across the board. We don\u2019t expect this print to materially deter the Fed as there are two additional NFP reads before the March meeting and a new chair on hand. We\u2019re also much more focused on the CPI print next Friday as far more relevant to the Fed\u2019s reaction function over this year.\u201d  CHRIS ZACCARELLI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, INDEPENDENT ADVISOR ALLIANCE, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA:  \u201cIt\u2019s a really weak number, surprising given how strong ADP was on Wednesday.

          "body": "TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened to a three-month high against its U.S. counterpart on Friday after stronger-than-expected domestic jobs data boosted expectations for a Bank of Canada interest rate hike as soon as this month.  The Canadian economy added almost 80,000 jobs for the second month in a row in December on a surge in part-time employment, and the jobless rate dipped to a 41-year low of 5.7 percent, Statistics Canada said. Analysts had expected a modest gain of 1,000 jobs.  \u201cIt certainly fits with a central bank that is likely to lift rates this quarter,\u201d said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.   Chances of a hike at the next rate decision on Jan. 17 rose to more than 60 percent from 35 percent before the data, the overnight index swaps market indicated. BOCWATCH  In separate data, Canada\u2019s trade deficit in November widened to C$2.54 billion as both exports and imports benefited from increased activity in the automotive industry, Statistics Canada said.  At 9:17 a.m. EST (1417 GMT), the Canadian dollar CAD=D4 was trading at C$1.2379 to the greenback, or 80.78 U.S. cents, up 0.9 percent.  The currency touched its strongest since Sept. 27 at C$1.2355.  Still, analysts in a Reuters poll say that an uncertain outlook for the North American Free Trade agreement could weigh on the loonie over the coming months.  The U.S. dollar .DXY pared gains against a basket of major currencies on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected in December.  The price of oil, one of Canada\u2019s major exports, fell as soaring U.S. production undermined a 10 percent rally from December lows.  U.S. crude CLc1 prices were down 0.84 percent at $61.49 a barrel.  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield  curve, with the two-year CA2YT=RR down 14 Canadian cents to yield 1.783 percent, its highest since June 2011, and the 10-year CA10YT=RR falling 63 Canadian cents to yield 2.161 percent.  The gap between Canada\u2019s 2-year yield and its U.S. counterpart narrowed by 7.9 basis points to a spread of -17.4 basis points, its narrowest since Oct. 30.

Two back-to-back months of 80,000 jobs. I know it\u2019s a little softer this month in terms of full-time versus part-time, but nonetheless over the past year of the 420,000 jobs created in Canada almost 400,000 were full-time.   \u201cIt\u2019s a spectacular year in terms of employment, and it shows that we are starting to run against capacity constraints right now, with the recent acceleration in wage inflation.\u201d  \u201cI think there\u2019s a rate hike in January. You\u2019re either data-dependant or you\u2019re not. If you\u2019re data-dependant and the data is as strong as it is right now, so all in all my view is that there is a rate hike in January.\u201d  \u201cIn our judgment, that should be enough to see the Bank of Canada hike rates later this month, with the employment figures more than enough to offset recent disappointments on GDP.  \u201cStatistics Canada notes that the unemployment rate is now the lowest \u201csince comparable data became available in January 1976\u201d. Over to you Governor Poloz indeed.  \u201cToday\u2019s figures should be massive catalysts for the C$, and negative for the front end of the curve.\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s very strong data. We have the wage growth that we were hoping to see and the Bank of Canada was hoping to see. The full-time, part-time split was more skewed to part-time work but still healthy in the number of full time jobs added.\u201d  \u201cThe only real negative thing I can see with this was there was a slight dip in youth employment which is something the governor (of the Bank of Canada) has been very preoccupied with. But on the whole it looks like a very positive report.\u201d  \u201cIt certainly fits with a central bank that is likely to lift rates this quarter. January should be viewed as a live meeting.\u201d  PAUL FERLEY, ASSISTANT CHIEF ECONOMIST, ROYAL BANK OF CANADA  \u201cThis report, in terms of the numbers both in employment growth and wage inflation, will raise the prospect of the bank continuing to withdraw the stimulus in the system with the economy appearing to have a pretty good head of steam.  \u201cThe bank has expressed concern about uncertainty with respect to the NAFTA renegotiations but today\u2019s report suggests that strength in the economy has a good chance of weathering any trade hit. The Canadian dollar\u2019s going to strengthen.\u201d   \u201cThe U.S. numbers won\u2019t trump the Canadian numbers so we will see some upward pressure on the Canadian dollar on the rising expectations of the bank moving at its policy meeting later this month.\u201d  \u201cIt was just another blowout employment report for Canada. The jobless rate is the lowest since the mid-70s. It could shift the dial on the Bank of Canada decision at the next policy meeting.   \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019ll change our view (from March) at this point. October GDP was quite weak and the trade balance deteriorated further in November, so that might be enough to keep the Bank of Canada sidelined until March.

          "title": "Trump targets book, threatens ex-ally Bannon with legal action",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer said on Thursday he would try to stop publication of a book that portrays an inept president in a fumbling White House and threatened legal action against former top aide Steve Bannon over \u201cdefamatory\u201d comments in the book.  \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by author Michael Wolff set off a political firestorm with its portrayal of Trump as not particularly wanting to win the U.S. presidency in 2016 and unprepared for the job.  Some of the harshest commentary came from Bannon, the right-wing firebrand who headed the final stage of Trump\u2019s campaign and became chief strategist at the White House before being fired in August.  Charles Harder, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, in a legal notice provided to Reuters, warned of possible claims including libel against Wolff and publisher Henry Holt & Co and threatened to try to block publication of the book. Harder also told Reuters that \u201clegal action is imminent\u201d against Bannon.  Henry Holt said in a statement it had received a cease-and-desist letter from Trump\u2019s attorney but would go ahead with publishing the book.  Earlier, the publishing house said that \u201cdue to unprecedented demand,\u201d it would release the book on Friday morning, rushing it to print after previously planning to put it out next Tuesday.  Wolff did not respond to a request for comment.  Trump tweeted on Thursday night: \u201cI authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don\u2019t exist. Look at this guy\u2019s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!\u201d  Trump cut ties with Bannon on Wednesday, saying his former adviser had \u201clost his mind,\u201d in a blistering statement issued after comments attributed to Bannon in the book were made public.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders heaped scorn on Bannon and the book at her briefing on Thursday. She said Breitbart News should consider firing Bannon and attempted to cast doubt on Wolff\u2019s accuracy.  She called the book \u201csome trash\u201d that came from \u201can author that no one had ever heard of until today.\u201d  \u201cThis book is mistake after mistake after mistake,\u201d she said.  Trump lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter to Bannon on Wednesday asking him not to disclose any confidential information. They said Bannon had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump, his family and the campaign and made \u201cdisparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements\u201d about them.  In the book, Bannon was quoted as describing a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d The meeting, held after the Russians promised damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, was attended by Donald Trump Jr., Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time.  Trump\u2019s statement also diminished Bannon\u2019s role in the election victory and accused him of leaking to the media. Before joining the campaign, Bannon headed the conservative Breitbart News website and proved to be a divisive figure in the White House. He returned to Breitbart after being fired, although he is reported to have continued to talk with Trump.  Bannon\u2019s reaction to the book controversy has been muted. In interviews with Breitbart News after the news broke, he called Trump a \u201cgreat man\u201d and pledged continued support for the president\u2019s agenda.  The president took note. \u201cHe called me a great man last night so he obviously changed his tune pretty quick,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to him. That\u2019s a misnomer.\u201d   Bradley Moss, a Washington lawyer specializing in national security law, said any non-disclosure agreement would not apply to Bannon once he became a government employee. The government has far less power to limit speech by employees than private companies, Moss said.  A lawsuit could hurt Trump because Bannon\u2019s lawyers would be entitled to interview White House officials and collect potentially damaging documents from them in his defense, Moss said.  \u201cI assume the cease-and-desist letter is aimed primarily at the public,\u201d added Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School. \u201cThe idea that he could block publication is absurd.\u201d  On Thursday, the White House also said no personal devices, including cellphones, would be allowed in the White House West Wing beginning next week for security purposes. The moves followed the Bannon split but had been considered for some time, White House officials said.  Bannon helped Trump shape a populist, anti-establishment message and had been the president\u2019s link to his hard-line conservative base of support, which is often at odds with the Republican Party establishment.  The story that triggered the Trump-Bannon split was an offshoot of the investigation into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia to sway the election to Trump, allegations Trump and Moscow deny.  Manafort and business associate Rick Gates, another campaign aide, pleaded not guilty in November to federal charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller including conspiracy to launder money. Manafort sued Mueller on Wednesday, alleging that his investigation exceeded its legal authority.

          "body": "WASHINGTON/SEOUL, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Talks starting Friday to amend a U.S.-South Korean trade deal must balance President Donald Trump\u2019s domestic agenda against the need to contain a nuclear armed North Korea and will have to be completed swiftly, officials from both sides told Reuters.  The U.S goods trade deficit with South Korea has doubled since the 2012 signing of the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). Almost 90 percent of the 2016 shortfall of $27.6 billion came from the auto sector, an issue the United States is expected to press hard in the Washington talks.  A quick deal could give Trump his first trade victory at a time when NAFTA negotiations are dragging on without agreement and pressure on China to change trade practices has yielded little progress.  The talks, led by Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Michael Beeman and Yoo Myung-hee, director general for FTA negotiations at South Korea\u2019s trade ministry, begin at a time of heightened tensions with Pyongyang.  A trade ministry official in Seoul said South Korea was waiting for Washington\u2019s formal proposals and substantial negotiations would not take place on Friday over a deal Trump has repeatedly threatened to scrap.  \u201cThe U.S. brought up lowering non-tariff barriers, especially for their auto industry. At the moment, we are not sure whether the U.S. will ask that but we will be prepared (for the U.S. demand),\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to talk to the press.  A top priority for the Americans is maintaining a 25 percent tariff on Korean pickup truck imports, which was meant to have been phased out from 2019 under the current deal, according to a U.S. official and a South Korean car industry source.  South Korea has two major automakers, Hyundai and Kia, both of which are heavily reliant on exports due to the small size of their domestic market. Critics charge that South Korea discriminates against imports with a range of non-tariff barriers.  South Korean auto companies believe that Washington will also seek to increase the 25,000-vehicle per U.S. automaker threshold for U.S. car shipments to South Korea that can enter the country without meeting Seoul\u2019s domestic industry regulations.  The official at a South Korea auto company, who was not authorized to speak to the media, also said the United States was interested in easing Seoul\u2019s vehicle emissions targets. These are viewed as discriminating against U.S. autos.  Since Kim Jong Un rose to power in North Korea in 2011, Pyongyang has conducted a series of increasingly powerful nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches, drawing ever tighter sanctions and a freeze on contacts between the two Koreas.  This week, however, Seoul agreed to high-level talks with the North in response to a New Year\u2019s speech by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un which offered an opening to diplomacy.  Pyongyang has a long history of seeking to play off Seoul and Washington as well as Beijing and Moscow in its diplomacy. Washington is wary of separate approaches and there are concerns that disagreements over KORUS could fuel a rift between South Korea and the United States.  The election of a left of center government in South Korea has raised concerns in Washington that Seoul may now be more willing to engage in talks. Under two previous right of center South Korean administrations, economic and other links between the countries were severed. \u201cI have a feeling that we will not take any precipitous action on KORUS for the time being,\u201d a senior U.S. official said while acknowledging that Trump and trade hawks within his administration had concerns with deal.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Models will strut their stuff on catwalks when London\u2019s menswear fashion week gets under way on Saturday, but absent will be some big industry names who have chosen to skip the event, or make digital presentations in place of runway shows.  The event will see around 50 traditional catwalk shows over three days, with the remainder of the 80 designers on the bill showcasing their wares through a variety of other events, including digitally.  The transition to new methods of connecting with buyers has cost the event some of its biggest catwalk names. Punk icon Vivienne Westwood announced last month that she would eschew a runway show and showcase her collection via an audio-visual presentation.  Other big Brands, including Britain\u2019s Burberry and J.W. Anderson, decided to skip the event last year and this year respectively, in favor of holding \u2018co-ed\u2019 shows during London\u2019s fashion week for womenswear in February.  \u201cAll we\u2019re trying to do is shorten the distance from a consumer to a pair of trousers,\u201d said London Fashion Week Men\u2019s Chairman Dylan Jones, who is also the editor of British GQ magazine.  \u201cIf a brand or a designer deems that it\u2019s much better for them to do a joint show, a show out of season, a digital show, go direct to consumer \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all about amplifying British creativity and selling.\u201d  Designers have been placing more emphasis on their digital presence in recent years, courting social media influencers with the same assiduousness that they traditionally reserved for the fashion press.  Online sales are a particularly important revenue stream in Britain\u2019s over 14 billion pound ($19 billion) menswear industry, growing by over 17 percent between 2010 and 2015 - outpacing all other categories in the sector - according to researchers IbisWorld.  With a shortage of big names on the catwalk this year, organizers said the event was returning to how it was originally envisioned - as a platform for young British talent.  \u201cInternational media and retailers come to London for this excitement, these new businesses, the ones that are setting the menswear world on fire and you can only get that in London,\u201d said British Fashion Council Chief Executive Caroline Rush.  It was a sentiment echoed by Jones, who saw the changes in the industry as a source of excitement.  \u201cIt\u2019s mutating and developing and changing each season.

          "body": "(Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased in November for a fourth straight month, but business spending on equipment appeared to be cooling after robust growth in 2017.  Factory goods orders jumped 1.3 percent amid rising demand for transportation and electrical equipment, the Commerce Department said on Friday. October\u2019s report was revised to show orders advancing 0.4 percent instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent dip.  Economists had forecast factory orders increasing 1.1 percent in November.  Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, fell 0.2 percent in November instead of slipping 0.1 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods increased 0.8 percent in October.  Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, fell 0.1 percent in November instead of increasing 0.3 percent as reported last month. Core capital goods shipments surged 1.2 percent in October.  Business spending soared last year as companies anticipated a massive cut in the corporate income tax rate, which has since been passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump.  The overhaul of the tax code, the most sweeping in 30 years, slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Robust business spending, recent weakness in the dollar and a strengthening global economy are boosting manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.  In November, orders for machinery fell 1.0 percent after rising 2.8 percent in October. But orders for transportation equipment rebounded 4.1 percent after declining 4.0 percent in October. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.6 percent.  Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao"

          "title": "After attacks by Trump, Bannon finds himself with few friends",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Following his brutal disavowal by President Donald Trump, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s dream of spearheading a new U.S. political movement appears in tatters while the Republican establishment he challenged is feeling more secure.  Trump turned on Bannon over his comments to the author of a book highly critical of the president and his family. The White House followed up on Thursday by suggesting that Bannon be ousted from his influential perch as chief executive of the hard-right news site Breitbart News.  Bannon appeared to have few close friends left among the more conservative factions of the Republican Party, which swiftly proclaimed their loyalty to Trump following the breakup.  \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone in the conservative movement that\u2019s supporting Steve over Donald Trump right now in this,\u201d Christopher Ruddy, a close Trump ally and chief executive of the conservative Newsmax site, told Reuters.   Mike Cernovich, a leading social-media voice of the so-called alt-right movement that Bannon helped energize on Trump\u2019s behalf, had no doubt about which of the two men had more popular support. \u201cThe base will stay with Trump.\u201d  Reader comments on Breitbart\u2019s site seemed overwhelmingly supportive of the president compared with Bannon. The Wall Street Journal reported late on Thursday that the site\u2019s board was considering letting him go.   Bannon\u2019s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.  Last year, media outlets as diverse as Time magazine and the comedy show \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d portrayed Bannon, Trump\u2019s election campaign strategist, as the power behind the president, an unshaven, shabbily dressed Svengali bending the Republican Party to his economic nationalist agenda.   But Bannon\u2019s star had been tumbling long before this week\u2019s flap over criticism Bannon leveled at Trump\u2019s family in Michael Wolff\u2019s new book on the White House.  In August, Bannon was fired amid a power struggle in the West Wing, forcing his return to Breitbart.   His reputation as a political mastermind then took a hit after Republicans lost a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama they had long held when the Bannon-backed Roy Moore, who was accused of improper conduct with teenage girls, fell to Democrat Doug Jones.  After leaving the White House, Bannon proclaimed his loyalty to Trump and vowed to wage an insurrection against the Republican establishment, especially Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom he accused of stalling Trump\u2019s policy agenda.  But last month, on the heels of Moore\u2019s loss in Alabama, McConnell helped steer an overhaul of the U.S. tax code through Congress, earning praise from Trump and depriving Bannon of his argument that the Republican-controlled Congress had not produced results.  Trump turned on Bannon on Wednesday, saying he had \u201clost his mind\u201d when he lost his job as chief strategist. He said Bannon did not represent Trump\u2019s political base and had exaggerated his influence even when he was at the White House.  Following Trump\u2019s attack, some of the candidates who had aligned themselves with Bannon\u2019s movement began stepping away, including Arizona U.S. Senate hopeful Kelli Ward and New York congressional candidate Michael Grimm, who called the attacks against Trump\u2019s family \u201cbaseless.\u201d  Bannon\u2019s influence, Ruddy said, had always stemmed from the belief that he was close to Trump.   \u201cHe\u2019s greatly diminished,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Steve forgets is the base is all about Donald Trump. It\u2019s not about Steve Bannon.\u201d  Josh Holmes, a former top aide to McConnell, said Bannon had been on a \u201cself-interested mission\u201d to play kingmaker inside the Republican Party.  \u201cI think that\u2019s over. ... A leader without followers is just a guy taking a walk,\u201d Holmes said.    A friend of Bannon, former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg, said he doubted Bannon\u2019s relationship with Trump could be fully repaired. But he added that Bannon would retain some sway over Trump\u2019s supporters, particularly on issues such as immigration.  \u201cThis is not the end of the world, particularly with this president,\u201d Nunberg said.   Trump is known for casting associates out of the fold, but also for bringing them back, particularly if there are common political interests or common enemies.   The president did appear to be in a slightly forgiving mood on Thursday, noting that Bannon had praised him the night before on a radio show.      \u201cI don\u2019t know, he called me a great man last night,\u201d Trump told reporters, \u201cso you know, he obviously changed his tune pretty quick.\u201d     However, in a tweet late on Thursday evening, he ridiculed Bannon with a new nickname, something Trump has commonly done to tag political foes and critics.  Slamming author Wolff for his \u201cphony\u201d book, Trump tweeted, \u201cLook at this guy\u2019s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!\u201d  Reporting by James Oliphant and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by John Whitesides; Written by James Oliphant; Editing by Kieran Murray and Peter Cooney"

          "title": "Frigid weather sends heating prices soaring as energy usage spikes",
          "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A severe winter storm in the U.S. Northeast brought plunging temperatures on Friday, driving regional natural gas prices to all-time highs, disrupting refinery operations and causing electrical outages.  From Baltimore to Caribou, Maine, efforts were under way to clear roadways from Thursday\u2019s snowfall. Temperatures were expected to be 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit below the average for this time of year and could set records, according to the National Weather Service.  Power outages fell to 123,000 down from the 235,000 knocked out by the storm over the past couple of days and were largely concentrated in Canada, with 85,100 in Nova Scotia, 16,600 in New Brunswick and 5,100 in Quebec.  Natural gas prices in the U.S. Northeast were at an all-time record on the back of heating demand. Benchmark U.S. heating oil futures were near their highest in almost three years.  Estimated U.S. natural gas demand soared on Monday, surpassing the previous single-day record set in 2014, according to estimates from Reuters. The increase came on the back of the low temperatures, higher consumption in the electric power and industrial sectors, and greater export demand.  U.S. demand for natural gas, which is the major heating fuel in the Northeast and is also widely used by power plants, was expected to remain near record highs this week.  Next-day gas prices in New York City NG-CG-NY-SNL jumped to a record $140.25 per million British thermal units, according to data from brokerage firm SNL going back to 1992. The prior high was $120.75 set during the polar vortex in January 2014.  Spot gas in New England soared to a record $82.75 per mmBtu, according to data going back to 1995. The prior high was $77.60, also in January 2014.  In 2017, next-day gas prices averaged $3.08 per mmBtu in New York and $3.80 in New England.  The only nuclear plant in Massachusetts remained shut on Friday after halting operations on Thursday afternoon due to the failure of a line that connects the reactor to the power grid.  Entergy Corp, which operates the Pilgrim Station, said it had not identified the cause of the line problem. ISO New England, which operates the region\u2019s power grid, attributed the shutdown to blizzard conditions.  The New England grid operator said it expected the region to have sufficient generating resources to meet the peak demand of 20,450 megawatts and reserve requirements of 2,128 MW on Friday but would only have a surplus of about 500 MW if it must use all of its reserves. Pilgrim\u2019s capacity is about 688 MW.  The average U.S. average home heating oil price rose 5.4 percent to $3.078 a gallon in the seven days through Jan. 1 from a week earlier, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. On the East Coast, the price increased 5.4 percent to $3.085.  Prices for the 2017-18 period are well above the 2016-17 levels, the data showed.  Next-day power prices in New England E-NEPLMHP-IDX and PJM E-PJWHRTP-IX, which covers much of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Midwest region, rose to their highest since January 2014 due to a spike for local natural gas.  There are concerns that a significant disruption could lead to a heating oil shortage as distillate inventories in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions are at their lowest levels for this time of year since 2015.  Supply worries have spurred tankers carrying diesel and heating oil to set out from Europe for the United States, reversing a traditional trade route.  Icebreakers have been used in ports of Boston, New York and Philadelphia to keep shipping lanes clear, but delays are expected, and the Coast Guard said late on Wednesday that those ships would remain at shore until the storm had passed.  Reliance on heating oil is highest in the Northeast, with about 21 percent of households using it for space heating.  Most northern U.S. refiners are not reporting problems. Philadelphia Energy Solutions postponed planned work at its 335,000 barrel-per-day refinery complex in Philadelphia until after the storm.  Ridgebury Pioneer, which was carrying 1.9 million barrels of heavy crude into the Philadelphia area, has been delayed by the storm, according to Reuters Eikon shipping data and two sources familiar with the delivery.

          "title": "Fed's Harker says two rate hikes 'appropriate' this year",
          "body": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker on Friday said he believes the central bank should raise rates just two times this year, fewer than most of his rate-setting colleagues, as low inflation continues to dog the U.S. economy.  The dovish turn for Harker, a supporter last year of all three of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate increases, signals a rising concern over the central bank\u2019s ability to revitalize inflation using its current 2-percent inflation target. Harker as recently as November said he expected three rate hikes to be appropriate for 2018.  Though unemployment has fallen to 4.1 percent, below what many economists see as full employment, wages have failed to pick up strongly, and inflation weakened rather than gained over the course of 2017.  Harker, in remarks prepared for delivery at the annual American Economic Association, said Friday he expects the economy to grow a bit slower than 2.5 percent. He forecasts unemployment will stay low this year before rising a few tenths of a percentage point next year, and inflation to push above 2 percent in 2019 before coming back to the Fed\u2019s target in 2020. There is \u201clittle slack\u201d left in the labor market, he said.  But, he said, \u201cif soft inflation persists, it may pose a significant problem,\u201d including making it ever more difficult to bring inflation back to healthy levels. \u201cFor that reason, my own view is that two rate increases are likely to be appropriate for 2018.\u201d  Most Fed officials expect three rate hikes this year, forecasts released last month show.  Harker also embraced a view gaining converts at the Fed that the central bank may need to tear up its playbook on monetary policy and explore adopting a new strategy such as price-level targeting, which would require the Fed to allow inflation to run hot for a while to make up for a period of low inflation.  \u201cI should be clear that I\u2019m not pushing for any changes, nor do I have any particular change I would prefer,\u201d Harker said. \u201cI\u2019d add that if and when that discussion arises, we need to be seriously considering the various alternatives \u2014 whether it\u2019s inflation targeting, price-level targeting, or asymmetric loss functions \u2014 and not fixating on one without serious academic debate about the others.\u2019 (Reporting by Ann Saphir Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

          "title": "Italy's BMPS preps debt market comeback",
          "body": "LONDON, Jan 5 (IFR) - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena is hoping to bring its first bond issue since narrowly averting failure last year, but will need to offer investors a sweetener while its restructuring plan remains in the early stages.  The Italian bank intends to take advantage of a purple patch in the market, announcing a euro Tier 2 10-year non-call five benchmark on Thursday designed to re-establish its access to wholesale funding and rebuild its subordinated debt.  BMPS has virtually no sub debt outstanding after \u20ac4.3bn was converted into equity last summer, a condition of a multi-billion precautionary recapitalisation by the Italian government which now owns 68% of the bank.  BMPS repeatedly failed supervisory exercises in the aftermath of the financial crisis, culminating in the European Central Bank uncovering a \u20ac8.8bn capital shortfall in 2016. A restructuring plan is now in place.  \u201cThe capital injection was quite substantial, and of course the securitisation of these \u20ac26bn of NPEs [non-performing exposures] will be quite important,\u201d said Filippo Alloatti, senior credit analyst at Hermes Investment Management.  The bank\u2019s phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 ratio now stands at 15.2%.  \u201cYou would think in terms of asset quality, they are a very different bank. It\u2019s not to say the work is done, and the turnaround plan is quite challenging, but for the moment they look a lot better than before,\u201d Alloatti said.  The bank\u2019s risk-weighted assets were last reported at around \u20ac63.3bn. That implies a Tier 2 target of roughly \u20ac1.3bn, which it is likely to tackle via two separate deals.  Blistering issuance conditions in 2017 flung open the door to many of Europe\u2019s smaller and lower-rated lenders. They included Banco Comercial Portugues which sold a \u20ac300m 4.5% 10-year non-call five Tier 2 (B3/B-/B+/BB) in November, now bid at 4.21%.  Among the Italian banks, Banco BPM\u2019s \u20ac500m 10-year non-call five (B2/BB) is trading around 3.99% while BPER Banca\u2019s \u20ac500m 5.125% 10-year non-call five (B1/BB-) is at 4.13%, according to Thomson Reuters.  BMPS\u2019 Tier 2 will carry even lower ratings - Caa2 from Moody\u2019s and CCC+ from Fitch.  Leads believe it will have to offer a premium to those names, but said initial interest is strong. The issuer will meet investors in London and Milan next week.  \u201cThis is ticking a lot of boxes right now, so we\u2019re quietly confident,\u201d said a banker at one of the leads. \u201cThere has been a painful cleansing in the last 12 or 18 months, but it\u2019s a cleaner credit than before.\u201d  Though on the path to recovery, the bank is facing a lawsuit brought by investors burnt by losses imposed on their bonds last year. The prospect of stricter rules around the provisioning for bad loans in the second half of 2018 also looms large.  \u201cA lot will depend on the grand bargain between the Germans and the rest of Europe on tightening up the rules on the provisions on NPEs, in exchange for letting this European deposit scheme finally take off,\u201d said Alloatti.  \u201cEven after the securitisation, BMPS would still have around \u20ac20bn of gross NPEs, so it\u2019s particularly sensitive to this development.\u201d  Goldman Sachs and Mediobanca are global coordinators and joint bookrunners. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, JP Morgan, MPS Capital Services and UBS are joint bookrunners. (Reporting by Alice Gledhill, editing by Matthew Davies)"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top House Democrat called for the immediate dismissal of White House counsel Don McGahn on Friday after a report that President Donald Trump asked McGahn to urge Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the investigation of Russian election meddling.  U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler said the incident, reported in the New York Times, was a clear effort to obstruct the Russia probe and he expected McGahn to volunteer to testify before the Judiciary Committee.  The Times said Trump directed McGahn to stop Sessions, who was a chief adviser in Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, from removing himself from a Justice Department probe into whether the campaign worked with Russians to sway the 2016 election.  McGahn failed to persuade Sessions to remain involved and Trump erupted in anger in front of a number of White House officials, saying the attorney general needed to protect him, according to the Times, which cited two people with knowledge of the episode.  Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee,  said the attorney general\u2019s job was to uphold the law, including rules on conflict of interest.  \u201cEither Mr. McGahn knows this and decided to interfere with the Russia investigation anyway, or he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Nadler said in a statement. \u201cNeither case is acceptable and he should be removed from his post immediately.\u201d  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Nadler\u2019s call for McGahn to step down.  After Sessions recused himself in March, the Justice Department appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to lead the investigation into possible collusion and whether Trump tried to obstruct the FBI\u2019s Russian inquiry. Republicans have attacked  Mueller\u2019s probe as politically motivated, prompting concerns among Democrats that Trump would fire him.  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal urged lawmakers on Friday to support legislation protecting the special counsel, citing the Times report. \u201cExplosive evidence of obstruction -  and imminent danger to Special Counsel. White House Staff need to testify before grand jury,\u201d Blumenthal wrote on Twitter.  Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bill Trott"

          "body": "* U.S. economy adds 148,000 jobs in Dec vs est. 190,000  * Average hourly earnings rise 0.3 pct, in line with estimates  * Cisco rises after BofA Merrill Lynch slaps \u2018buy\u2019 rating  * Indexes up: Dow 0.18 pct, S&P 0.18 pct, Nasdaq 0.33 pct (Updates to open)  By Sruthi Shankar  Jan 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street\u2019s main indexes rose on Friday as investors looked beyond weaker-than-expected U.S. job additions in December and took support from signs of a pick-up in wage growth.  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said, while economists had forecast a rise of 190,000.  Stock futures pared gains briefly after the report, which was also in sharp contrast to Thursday\u2019s data that showed private employers added a stronger-than-expected 250,000 jobs in December.  Monthly wage gains was a bright spot that pointed to labor market strength and could strengthen the chances of the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates in March.  The odds of a March rate hike stood at 67.5 percent, according to CME Group\u2019s Fedwatch tool, nearly unchanged from before the release of the report.  Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent in December after gaining 0.1 percent in the prior month. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent in November.  \u201cIt\u2019s a really weak number, surprising given how strong ADP was on Wednesday. However, it\u2019s only one month. People usually look at the three-month average as it\u2019s usually a better gauge,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer of Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.  \u201cThe market will probably overlook this for now. I would look next month for confirmation if it\u2019s a trend.\u201d  At 9:40 a.m. ET (1540 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 46.05 points, or 0.18 percent, at 25,121.18. The blue-chip index closed above 25,000 for the first time on Thursday, its quickest 5,000-point climb since the index was created in 1896.  The S&P 500 was up 4.85 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,728.84 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 23.43 points, or 0.33 percent, at 7,101.34.  Among the 11 major S&P sectors, energy was the biggest decliner, down 0.37 percent as oil prices pulled away from their 2015 highs on soaring U.S. production.  Chevron and Exxon fell 0.4 percent, weighing on the sector.  The S&P technology index rose 0.55 percent, leading the gainers.  Microsoft\u2019s 1 percent rise and Apple\u2019s 0.6 percent gain boosted the sector.  Cisco rose 1.33 percent after BofA Merrill Lynch brokers upgraded the stock to \u201cbuy\u201d.  Francesca\u2019s Holdings tanked 16.5 percent after the women\u2019s apparel and accessories maker said it expected up to 17 percent decline in current-quarter same-store sales.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,577 to 982. On the Nasdaq, 1,486 issues rose and 909 fell.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Match alerts fell to a three-year low in 2017 as the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) continued to bolster its measures to protect the sport from the threat of corruption.  The TIU annual report showed it had received a total of 241 alerts from betting operators and regulators in 2017, compared with 292 in 2016 and 246 in the previous 12 months.  The majority of the alerts were from the second and third tiers of professional men\u2019s tennis \u2014 ATP Challenger and ITF Futures events \u2014 with only seven from grand slam tournaments.  Match alerts are not proof of wrongdoing, merely indicators of suspicious betting activity.  During 2017 the TIU prosecuted 14 corruption cases and handed lifetime bans to three players.  \u201cThere is no doubt that most players and officials conduct themselves in an exemplary fashion, but the small minority who choose to break the rules are a continuing concern,\u201d TIU director Nigel Willerton said in the report.  The potential for match-fixing in tennis hit the headlines two years ago following a report by BuzzFeed News and the BBC which claimed numerous players ranked inside the top 50 had thrown matches to aid corrupt betting.  Allegations that evidence of match-fixing had been concealed by the game\u2019s ruling bodies were denied.  Since then the budget for the TIU, set up in 2008 and funded by the men\u2019s ATP Tour, women\u2019s WTA, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the four grand slams, has been increased with $3.71 million being set aside for 2018.  Full-time staffing levels have risen to 17 from just a handful three years ago, while a TIU Training and Education Unit will be established this year to help educate young players against the risks of corruption.

          "body": "(Adds spending by rival eastern central bank)  By Aidan Lewis  TUNIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Libya earned $14 billion in oil revenues in 2017, nearly three times more than in the previous year, allowing it to halve its budget deficit, the central bank said, amid a partial recovery in oil output despite continued political and economic turmoil.  Libya\u2019s budget deficit for 2017 stood at 10.6 billion Libyan dinars ($7.85 billion), down from 20.3 billion dinars the previous year, the bank said in statement published late on Thursday. Oil revenues had totalled $4.8 billion in 2016.  Its oil earnings accounted for more than 86 percent of Libya\u2019s total national revenues of 22.31 billion dinars.  Of 32.7 billion dinars worth of state spending, 20.3 billion dinars went on state salaries and 6 billion dinars on subsidies, the statement said.  The figures show the partial recovery last year in oil production slightly slowing the otherwise rapid economic decline of a nation still dogged by armed conflict and political upheaval more than seven years after the overthrow of veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi.  Economists say it is unclear to what extent the central bank\u2019s figures fully reflect economic activity, because the institution has been split for several years between its Tripoli headquarters and a rival branch loyal to a government based in eastern Libya.  The Tripoli central bank said its figures did not include 22 billion dinars of what it regards as unauthorised spending by the central bank in the east.  Libya has been divided since 2014 between rival institutions and warring factions based in the east and west.  However, the central bank in Tripoli has continued to control oil revenues, which account for nearly all the country\u2019s income, and to disburse them across the country.  Oil production, in decline from 2013, recovered to around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) last year, but this is still well below the more than 1.6 million bpd Libya was pumping before the 2011 uprising.  Living standards have dropped sharply, with inflation running at around 30 percent and the dinar slipping on the black market to around 9 dinars to the dollar.  Foreign reserves have fallen to an estimated $67.5 billion, compared to $123.5 billion in 2012, according to the World Bank.  The central bank said in November it had agreed on currency and spending reforms with the internationally recognised government in Tripoli, but it is unclear when the plan will be carried out.

          "title": "OPEC oil cut adherence rises in Dec as Venezuela output slides: survey",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC deepened compliance with an oil supply-cutting deal in December due to a further decline in Venezuelan output and extra cuts by Gulf exporters, a Reuters survey found, showing strong commitment to the deal despite higher prices.  Adherence to the curbs rose to 128 percent from 125 percent in November, the survey found. The United Arab Emirates for the first time since the deal took effect in January 2017 pumped below its OPEC target, joining Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is reducing output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) as part of a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers. The pact will run until the end of 2018.  Oil hit its highest since May 2015 this week,  supported by falling inventories, strong demand and high OPEC compliance. Many producers, still suffering from a 2014 price collapse, are enjoying the rally and the extra revenues.  \u201cWe are all pleased about it,\u201d one official in an OPEC country said of the early 2018 price rise.  The survey shows no sign of producers boosting output to cash in on higher prices or to replace the decline in Venezuela, where output is dropping amid an economic crisis.   In the past, waning compliance as oil prices rallied has reduced the effectiveness of OPEC accords.  Top exporter Saudi Arabia trimmed output by 60,000 bpd, according to sources in the survey who cited stable to lower exports and lower refinery processing, putting supply further below the kingdom\u2019s OPEC target.  Production in Venezuela, where the oil industry is starved of funds due to a cash crunch, has fallen further below its OPEC target, the survey found. Both exports and refinery operations were lower in December.  The UAE, the incoming OPEC president, has cut production further and delivered its highest adherence yet, according to Reuters surveys. The UAE was a laggard on compliance for most of 2017, compared to peers like Saudi Arabia.  \u201cThe UAE has the OPEC presidency this year and they feel they should try to do better,\u201d said an industry source, who has discussed the issue with OPEC officials.  Libyan output slipped by 30,000 bpd, hampered by damage to a pipeline in a suspected attack and other outages.  Among countries with higher output, the biggest rise came from Nigeria, whose exports in December were set to reach a 21-month high, although actual shipments fell short of that level.  The second-largest came from Iraq. A boost in exports from Iraq\u2019s south, the outlet for most of its crude, to a record 3.55 million bpd in December, offset relatively low shipments from the north, the survey found.  Output in northern Iraq is still down after falling in mid-October when Iraqi forces retook control of oilfields from Kurdish fighters who had been there since 2014. This has had the side-effect of boosting Iraqi compliance.  Algerian output rose after a reduced impact from planned oilfield maintenance.  OPEC in late 2016 announced a production target of 32.50 million bpd. The target includes Indonesia, which has since left OPEC, and does not include Equatorial Guinea, the latest country to join.  According to the survey, output in December has averaged 32.28 million bpd, about 530,000 bpd above the target adjusted to remove Indonesia and not including Equatorial Guinea.  With Equatorial Guinea, production in December totaled 32.41 million bpd, up 20,000 bpd from November. The November  total was revised down by 90,000 bpd to the lowest since April 2017, according to Reuters surveys.  The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

          "body": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - The average fuel economy of new vehicles sold in the United States in December fell marginally as consumers bought more fuel-thirsty trucks than more efficient passenger cars, a report showed.  The average fuel economy slipped to 25.0 miles per gallon (mpg), down 0.2 mpg from the revised value for November, according to a report by University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.  The report comes at a time when automakers have been demanding a cut in the fuel efficiency standards for 2025, arguing that the target was difficult to achieve as consumers prefer larger, less efficient vehicles.  The Obama administration finalized rules in 2012 to double the fleetwide average fuel economy to 54.5 mpg by 2025, but the Environmental Protection Agency lowered it to 51.4 mpg based on rising number of trucks.  The drop in December number likely reflected the increased numbers of light trucks in the sales mix versus passenger cars, said Michael Sivak, who heads the Sustainable Worldwide Transportation research group at the university.  America\u2019s love affair with gas-guzzlers like Ford Motor Co\u2019s bestselling F-Series pickups is showing no signs of fading.  The total number of light trucks sold in the United States rose 4.3 percent to about 10.90 million in 2017, while sales of passenger cars slumped about 11 percent to 6.3 million.  The average fuel economy of new vehicles sold in 2017 was 25.2 mpg, unchanged from 2016, according to the report. (Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)"

          "body": "DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Liberia\u2019s development is at risk of slowing as Nobel prize-winning president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a darling of foreign aid donors, is replaced this month by an ex-soccer star with little government experience, experts said.   George Weah, who grew up in a slum in the West African country and later played for top European football clubs, was elected last week to succeed Johnson Sirleaf as her 12-year tenure draws to an end.  Johnson Sirleaf, who previously worked for the World Bank and the United Nations, has been credited with putting the country back on its feet after it was ravaged by civil wars from 1989 to 2003.  But the progress she made - such as building schools, roads, and hospitals - was bankrolled by huge foreign aid flows that analysts say Weah may be unable to maintain.   \u201cI think a lot of it had to do with her competence and strategy. Once she came into office, donors lined up,\u201d said Steven Radelet, an economist at Georgetown University and former advisor to Johnson Sirleaf.   Liberia still faces severe poverty and underdevelopment and was further crippled by the Ebola epidemic in 2014-2016. Less than one in ten households have electricity and two thirds of people live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.   Some aid programs that ended last year were not renewed because donors were anxious about the presidential transition, and this trend will likely continue, Radelet said.   \u201cIt is a risky time,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that times would be hard even if Johnson Sirleaf were staying.  Aid accounts for more than half of Liberia\u2019s gross national income, making it one of the most aid-dependent countries in the world, according to the World Bank. Its chief exports - iron ore and rubber - are in a slump, leaving little means of earning.  \u201cIf the new government is stable and reasonably competent, the World Bank and the African Development Bank will continue to support them,\u201d said Judith Tyson, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute.  \u201cBut if not, they may be hesitant to extend further assistance and that would be damaging,\u201d she said, adding that there is some doubt in development circles about Weah\u2019s credibility in economic management.  Beyond securing aid, Johnson Sirleaf knew how it should be used and was more involved in development projects than most heads of state, said people who worked with her.   \u201cShe has a very deep knowledge of the strengths and comparative advantage of every donor,\u201d said Larisa Leshchenko, Liberia country manager for the World Bank.  The World Bank, one of Liberia\u2019s top donors, supports work in agriculture, infrastructure, women\u2019s empowerment, and more. While its major policies will be maintained, it is too soon to say whether all programs will continue, Leshchenko said.

          "body": "NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Sengwer, a tribe living in the forests of\u00a0western\u00a0Kenya, say  they have faced a fresh round of evictions by Kenyan authorities to pave the way for a European Union-funded project to protect water catchment areas in the region.  Some 100 Kenya Forest Service (KFS) guards started evicting Sengwer people from the\u00a0Embobut\u00a0forest on Dec. 29, activists said, in\u00a0a case that illustrates tensions between indigenous people\u2019s land rights and conservation projects.  \u201cThey took a six-year-old boy and went around burning houses with him after his mother fled. They left him in the forest at night alone,\u201d Milka Chepkorir, an activist from the community, said at a news conference in Nairobi on Thursday.  The KFS said it was not aware of any evictions during the Christmas and New Year period, a position that was corroborated by Kenya\u2019s environment ministry.  \u201cSome people have been trying to erect structures in the forest illegally and we\u2019ve heightened our surveillance,\u201d Dedan Nderitu, KFS head of conservancy\u00a0in the North Rift\u00a0region, told Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  Vincent de Boer, a representative at the EU Commission in Nairobi, said they had been informed by the KFS that guards in Embobut forest were there to deal with cattle rustlers from the neighboring Pokot and Marakwet communities, not for evictions.  \u201cThis being said the EU will take independent measures to ascertain the facts,\u201d de Boer said in an emailed statement.   The Sengwer hunter-gatherers have fought with the government for more than five decades for the right to live in the Embobut forest in the Cherengany Hills from where they were first evicted by British colonialists in the 19th century.  Rights group Amnesty International wrote to Kenya\u2019s environment ministry\u00a0this week with\u00a0reports\u00a0it had received\u00a0from Sengwer community members and local media that KFS guards burnt at least 15 huts, fired shots in the air and shot dead several animals.  Amnesty said the December evictions were carried out despite a High Court injunction that forbids the eviction or arrest of Sengwer resident in the forest, pending the hearing of a court challenge to the legality of mass evictions carried out in 2014.  The United Nations and the World Bank criticized the KFS in 2014 for forcibly evicting thousands of Sengwer from the forest by burning their homes, leaving many camped out by the roadside.  \u201cThe approach of KFS is conservation without people,\u201d Clement Lenachuru, a commissioner at National Lands Commission of Kenya. \u201c(But) the Sengwer are also not ready to sit down and discuss. They are becoming antagonistic.\u201d  Sengwer community leaders called on the government to halt\u00a0a\u00a0six-year, 31 million euro ($37 million) program, launched in June 2016 to protect Kenya\u2019s five water towers in the Mount Elgon and Cherangany ecosystems.  \u201cOur government has continued to burn houses and chase our people from our community land. They\u2019d rather kill us on our own land than we go suffer elsewhere,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Yator Kiptum, a Sengwer activist.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Mixed results from two late-stage studies testing Kala Pharmaceuticals Inc\u2019s drug to provide temporary relief from dry eye disease cast doubt on the drug\u2019s path forward and sent shares down 16 percent in early trading on Friday.  The trials met three out of four main goals, falling short of showing a statistically significant reduction in discomfort of the eye in one study.  \u201cThe question is will the FDA accept this or make them do another trial before approval?\u201d Wedbush analyst Liana Moussatos told Reuters, dubbing Kala\u2019s first trial \u201cthe best results\u201d for dry eye she\u2019d seen in a late-stage study.  The company said it had no immediate discussions with the U.S. regulator and would need to conduct further analyses before determining a path forward.  If Kala\u2019s drug, KPI-121, were to secure U.S. approval it would be the first treatment to provide rapid relief for acute, episodic dry eye flares.  The drug would face no real competition as approved treatments for dry eye such as Allergan Plc\u2019s blockbuster Restasis and Shire Plc\u2019s Xiidra are indicated for chronic patients with continuous symptoms of the disease, rather than flare-ups.  Dry eye is caused by either a lack of tears, or a \u201cpoor quality\u201d of tears that cannot lubricate the surface of the eye, resulting in itching and inflammation.  The disease affects about 33 million people in the United States, the company said.  Moussatos called KPI-121 a \u201cclean drug\u201d and pointed to the possibility of it gaining approval for use in severely affected patients, with an FDA-mandated requirement for a post-marketing trial.

          "title": "As Macron embarks on China tour, reciprocity is the word",
          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s visit to China next week will be the first by a major European leader since the Communist party\u2019s recent leadership congress, and he will use it to try to secure greater access for French companies and forge a yet-to-be-defined Asia policy.  In his first official visit to the world\u2019s second-largest economy since his election last May, Macron is expected to push for a more level playing field in trade relations, as France tries to cut a 30 billion-euro trade deficit with China.  \u201cThere\u2019s an ambition to rebalance, get more reciprocity in access to Chinese markets and fairer competition conditions,\u201d an advisor to Macron said on condition of anonymity.  By reciprocity, French officials mean easier access for foreign companies to regulated or protected sectors of the Chinese economy. Chinese officials say that concept is \u201crelative\u201d in an emerging economy.  Like other Westerners, the French have long complained about China\u2019s rules for foreign investments and its demands for technology transfers and compulsory joint-ventures with local rivals.  French carmakers Renault and Peugeot-Citroen in particular have had to set up partnerships with domestic companies but have had only limited success in gaining a slice of the world\u2019s biggest auto market.  French officials hope the emergence of a prosperous Chinese middle-class will give French companies, which tend to specialize in consumer products, an edge over German rivals more focused on machinery and equipment.  But besides the usual race for market share, Macron\u2019s advisors say he will also defend a common European Union line for freer trade between the blocs, in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric.  As an economy minister in the previous Socialist government, Macron led the fight to toughen EU anti-dumping rules imports of cheap Chinese steel surged.   In June, he also urged the Commission to build a system for screening investments in strategic sectors from outside the bloc, which drew criticism from Beijing.  \u201cEven if on the surface the trip goes smoothly and faux-pas are avoided because the two presidents are smart and it\u2019s the first state visit, I think on substance each will firmly defend their own priorities,\u201d Alice Ekman of the Paris-based think tank IFRI told Reuters.  A delegation of 50 company executives, from nuclear giants EDF and Areva, planemaker Airbus and hotels group Accor, as well as representatives of the French beef, pork and milk lobbies are expected to travel with Macron.  Airbus is in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China during the visit, sources said.  The trip will also be an opportunity for the 40-year-old president, who has mostly focused on Europe and its neighborhood since his election, to define his country\u2019s role in Asia.  The two countries are expected to discuss security issues such as North Korea, after Pyongyang agreed to hold talks with the South next week amid a standoff over its nuclear and missile programs.  French officials have touted the fight against climate change as another key issue for cooperation with China, now that Trump has announced he would pull out of the Paris climate accord signed in 2015.  History and symbols will also feature on the trip, as they did with Trump and Putin, whom Macron received in grandiose settings such as the Champs-Elysees and the Palace of Versailles. Macron is expected to visit cultural landmarks such as the ancient Terracotta Army in the former capital of Xian and the Forbidden City in Beijing, the ancient home of China\u2019s emperors.

          "title": "Author of Trump book contradicts president, says he interviewed him",
          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The author of a deeply critical book about Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office said on Friday he had spoken with the president while working on it, contradicting Trump\u2019s assertion that he had never talked to the writer for the book and had authorized \u201cZero access\u201d to the White House.  Michael Wolff\u2019s book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d went on sale on Friday, its release pulled forward after published excerpts this week set off a political firestorm, threats by Trump lawyers of legal action and an effort to halt publication.  The book, dismissed by Trump as full of lies, depicts a chaotic White House, a president who was ill-prepared to win the office in 2016, and Trump aides who scorned his abilities.  Wolff told NBC on Friday that he stood by his reporting and had talked to the president for the book.  \u201cI absolutely spoke to the president. Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don\u2019t know, but it was certainly not off the record,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program, adding that he had spoken to people who spoke to Trump on a daily, \u201csometimes minute by minute\u201d basis.  Asked to clarify what he meant when he wrote that Trump\u2019s entire circle questioned his fitness for office, Wolff said, \u201cLet me put a marker in the sand here: 100 percent of the people around him ... They all say he is like a child. And what they mean by that is he has a need for immediate gratification. It\u2019s all about him.\u201d  On Thursday evening, Trump tweeted that, \u201cI authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book.\u201d  \u201cFull of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don\u2019t exist. Look at this guy\u2019s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!\u201d Trump added.  The early excerpts have also caused a deep public rift with Trump\u2019s former chief strategist and top campaign aide, Steve Bannon, over his comments in the book about Trump and his family, shaking the president\u2019s populist movement.  Lawyers for Trump had called on the book\u2019s publisher, Henry Holt & Co, to halt the book\u2019s release, originally scheduled for Tuesday. Instead, it began sales early. As of Friday, \u201cFire and Fury\u201d was the top-selling book on Amazon.com.  Customers in Washington queued up in sub-freezing temperatures to purchase a copy at KramerBooks, which began selling copies at midnight. The bookstore had sold out of copies as of Friday morning at 9 am (1400 GMT).  The White House has said the book is riddled with errors. Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, who has called the book trash, said again on Friday that Wolff had talked only briefly to the president and did not have wide access.  \u201cThis is a guy who made up a lot of stories to try to sell books,\u201d she said in an interview on Fox News.  Charles Harder, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, in a legal notice provided to Reuters, warned on Thursday of possible claims including libel against Wolff and Henry Holt & Co and threatened to try to block publication of the book. Harder also told Reuters that \u201clegal action is imminent\u201d against Bannon.  Henry Holt said it had received a cease-and-desist letter from Trump\u2019s attorney but would go ahead with publishing the book.  Bannon\u2019s reaction to the controversy has been muted. In interviews after the news broke with the conservative Breitbart News website, he called Trump a \u201cgreat man\u201d and pledged continued support for the president\u2019s agenda.

          "body": "TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened to a three-month high against its U.S. counterpart on Friday after stronger-than-expected domestic jobs data boosted expectations for a Bank of Canada interest rate hike as soon as this month.  The Canadian economy added almost 80,000 jobs for the second month in a row in December on a surge in part-time employment, and the jobless rate dipped to a 41-year low of 5.7 percent, Statistics Canada said. Analysts had expected a modest gain of 1,000 jobs.  \u201cIt certainly fits with a central bank that is likely to lift rates this quarter,\u201d said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.   Chances of a hike at the next rate decision on Jan. 17 rose to more than 60 percent from 35 percent before the data, the overnight index swaps market indicated. BOCWATCH  In separate data, Canada\u2019s trade deficit in November widened to C$2.54 billion as both exports and imports benefited from increased activity in the automotive industry, Statistics Canada said.  At 9:17 a.m. EST (1417 GMT), the Canadian dollar CAD=D4 was trading at C$1.2379 to the greenback, or 80.78 U.S. cents, up 0.9 percent.  The currency touched its strongest since Sept. 27 at C$1.2355.  Still, analysts in a Reuters poll say that an uncertain outlook for the North American Free Trade agreement could weigh on the loonie over the coming months.  The U.S. dollar .DXY pared gains against a basket of major currencies on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected in December.  The price of oil, one of Canada\u2019s major exports, fell as soaring U.S. production undermined a 10 percent rally from December lows.  U.S. crude CLc1 prices were down 0.84 percent at $61.49 a barrel.  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield  curve, with the two-year CA2YT=RR down 14 Canadian cents to yield 1.783 percent, its highest since June 2011, and the 10-year CA10YT=RR falling 63 Canadian cents to yield 2.161 percent.  The gap between Canada\u2019s 2-year yield and its U.S. counterpart narrowed by 7.9 basis points to a spread of -17.4 basis points, its narrowest since Oct. 30.

          "title": "OPEC oil cut adherence rises in Dec as Venezuela output slides: survey",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC deepened compliance with an oil supply-cutting deal in December due to a further decline in Venezuelan output and extra cuts by Gulf exporters, a Reuters survey found, showing strong commitment to the deal despite higher prices.  Adherence to the curbs rose to 128 percent from 125 percent in November, the survey found. The United Arab Emirates for the first time since the deal took effect in January 2017 pumped below its OPEC target, joining Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is reducing output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) as part of a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers. The pact will run until the end of 2018.  Oil hit its highest since May 2015 this week,  supported by falling inventories, strong demand and high OPEC compliance. Many producers, still suffering from a 2014 price collapse, are enjoying the rally and the extra revenues.  \u201cWe are all pleased about it,\u201d one official in an OPEC country said of the early 2018 price rise.  The survey shows no sign of producers boosting output to cash in on higher prices or to replace the decline in Venezuela, where output is dropping amid an economic crisis.   In the past, waning compliance as oil prices rallied has reduced the effectiveness of OPEC accords.  Top exporter Saudi Arabia trimmed output by 60,000 bpd, according to sources in the survey who cited stable to lower exports and lower refinery processing, putting supply further below the kingdom\u2019s OPEC target.  Production in Venezuela, where the oil industry is starved of funds due to a cash crunch, has fallen further below its OPEC target, the survey found. Both exports and refinery operations were lower in December.  The UAE, the incoming OPEC president, has cut production further and delivered its highest adherence yet, according to Reuters surveys. The UAE was a laggard on compliance for most of 2017, compared to peers like Saudi Arabia.  \u201cThe UAE has the OPEC presidency this year and they feel they should try to do better,\u201d said an industry source, who has discussed the issue with OPEC officials.  Libyan output slipped by 30,000 bpd, hampered by damage to a pipeline in a suspected attack and other outages.  Among countries with higher output, the biggest rise came from Nigeria, whose exports in December were set to reach a 21-month high, although actual shipments fell short of that level.  The second-largest came from Iraq. A boost in exports from Iraq\u2019s south, the outlet for most of its crude, to a record 3.55 million bpd in December, offset relatively low shipments from the north, the survey found.  Output in northern Iraq is still down after falling in mid-October when Iraqi forces retook control of oilfields from Kurdish fighters who had been there since 2014. This has had the side-effect of boosting Iraqi compliance.  Algerian output rose after a reduced impact from planned oilfield maintenance.  OPEC in late 2016 announced a production target of 32.50 million bpd. The target includes Indonesia, which has since left OPEC, and does not include Equatorial Guinea, the latest country to join.  According to the survey, output in December has averaged 32.28 million bpd, about 530,000 bpd above the target adjusted to remove Indonesia and not including Equatorial Guinea.  With Equatorial Guinea, production in December totaled 32.41 million bpd, up 20,000 bpd from November. The November  total was revised down by 90,000 bpd to the lowest since April 2017, according to Reuters surveys.  The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Elina Svitolina switched gears after a poor start to knock out holder Karolina Pliskova and set up a title clash with qualifier Aliaksandra Sasnovich at the Brisbane International on Friday.  Third seed Svitolina was staring at a potential hammering at the hands of her big-hitting Czech opponent as she went behind 4-0 in the opening set before finding her feet to seal a 7-5 7-5 victory in an hour and 39 minutes.  Sasnovich became the first qualifier to reach the final at Brisbane as she overcame a leg injury to dump out seventh seed Anastasija Sevastova 7-6(3) 6-4 in the other semi-final.  Trailing early in the contest, Svitolina reeled off seven of the next eight games to take the first set. The Ukranian raced to a 5-2 lead in the second but Pliskova was not ready to surrender and saved a match point before leveling at 5-5.  A double fault by Pliskova gave Svitolina the opening she needed to serve for the match and the No.6 completed the job in style.  Earlier, world No.88 Sasnovich began her match strongly but allowed Sevastova to push the first set to a tiebreaker before regaining composure to secure the early advantage.  Clearly feeling the effects of playing her seventh match of the tournament, Sasnovich called for a medical timeout before the second set.   She soldiered on with heavy strapping on her legs and saved two breakpoints to hold for 3-3 and won a decisive break in the ninth game of the second set to set up the victory.  \u201cI really like to start the season like this,\u201d Sasnovich said. \u201cBut (making the) final, it\u2019s not enough for me. The title is forever. Maybe some people forget (the losing finalist), but the winner, no one.  \u201cIt\u2019s good for me, good for our country, good for all of the people who support me. Without them, it was not possible ... It\u2019s nice to be first (qualifier in the final). It has motivated me.\u201d  Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by David Goodman"

Vancouver-based Aurora on Thursday announced a joint venture with Danish tomato and pepper producer Alfred Pedersen & Son to make and sell cannabis in Europe.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s economy looks set for a subdued run-up to Brexit, according to a range of indicators that paint a mixed picture at the start of the country\u2019s last full year in the European Union.  Forecasters generally think the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy will continue to expand at a slow but steady pace during 2018, a better prospect than the gloomy predictions made around the time of the shock vote to quit the bloc in mid-2016.  That means Britain is again likely to lag behind a recovering euro zone and most of its wealthy counterparts among the Group of Seven countries.   Predictions vary widely, due to uncertainties about the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the future of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s weakened government.  Forecasts for growth in 2018 range from just 0.3 percent to 2.2 percent with a central view of 1.3 percent, according to a Reuters poll of economists published last month.   Britain lagged every other G7 country in terms of growth over the first three quarters of 2017 and has been outpaced by the euro zone ever since the Brexit referendum.  Business surveys suggest it is likely to have matched the quarterly 0.4 percent economic growth it managed between July and September in the final three months.  That would give a conservative slant to last month\u2019s Reuters poll forecast of 1.5 percent for 2017 as a whole.  With Brexit due in less than 15 months, many think 2018 will be tougher, with the same poll pegging annual average growth for this year at around 1.3 percent.  The Bank of England expects the economy will grow by an above-consensus 1.6 percent in 2018, while the Office of Budget Responsibility predicts 1.4 percent.

The BoE and many economists think that will prove to be the peak, giving some relief to households that have seen the value of their earnings eroded by rising prices.  Helping matters, sterling looks likely to hold around $1.34 to $1.36 through this year, according to a Reuters poll out this week.   Wage growth looks likely to pick up in 2018, although previous forecasts on pay have tended to err on the optimistic side.  House prices are set to extend a slow march higher next year, apart from in London where they are likely to fall.   For the graphic 'UK inflation and wages', click - reut.rs/2CrwkE1  Household spending is the main driver of Britain\u2019s economy and it increased by just 1.0 percent year-on-year during the third quarter of 2017, the weakest rise since 2012.   Economists will be keeping a close eye on this: an outright fall in annual household spending is usually, but not always, a symptom of recession.    For the graphic 'UK household spending', click - reut.rs/2CU4zVD  Net migration to Britain recorded its biggest plunge in recent decades in the 12 months after the Brexit vote with three-quarters of the drop due to more EU citizens leaving and fewer arriving.  The BoE thinks Brexit is likely to mean the economy will not be able grow as fast as before without pushing up inflation, as the number of migrant workers coming to the country slows and companies hold off on spending to increase capacity.  Governor Mark Carney has said these constraints represent a lower Brexit \u201cspeed limit\u201d for the economy.    For the graphic 'UK migration', click - reut.rs/2CuovNU  The pound\u2019s fall may have helped some exporters but business groups say its overall effect has been negative for domestically-focused companies.  Export volumes have jumped over the last 18 months but much of the increase is probably linked to the recovery in the global economy. Britain\u2019s recent export performance is average compared with other European countries.  The BoE expects net trade to give a small boost to economic growth in the first half of 2018.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should charge a 25-pence ($0.34) \u201clatte levy\u201d on disposable coffee cups to cut down waste and ban them if a recycling target is not met by 2023, a committee of lawmakers said on Friday.  Less than 1 percent of coffee cups are recycled in Britain because of the tightly bonded plastic liner, the difficulties of recycling packaging which has been in contact with food and drink and a lack of facilities, the lawmakers said.  Chains Pret A Manger, Costa Coffee, Caffe Nero and Greggs alongside U.S. firm Starbucks are among the biggest coffee-sellers in Britain and have rapidly expanded in the last 10 years to meet increasing demand.  Although some outlets give a discount to customers using their own cup, only 1-2 percent of buyers take up the offer, according to parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee which said a \u201clatte levy\u201d was needed instead.  \u201cThe UK throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year; enough to circle the planet five and a half times,\u201d said Chair of the committee, Mary Creagh.  \u201cWe\u2019re calling for action to reduce the number of single use cups, promote reusable cups over disposable cups and to recycle all coffee cups by 2023,\u201d she said.  The committee said that money raised by the charge should help improve recycling facilities and if the 2023 target is not met then disposable coffee cups should be banned.   The Irish parliament is considering banning single-use coffee cups whilst the German city Hamburg said in 2016 it will no longer use coffee-makers with aluminum capsules in its own offices or buildings.   In October 2015, Britain introduced a charge of 5 pence on all single-use plastic bags provided by large shops, which led to an 83 percent reduction in UK plastic bags used in the first year.   On Friday the environment ministry said the government was working closely with the sector and had made progress in increasing recycling rates.  \u201cWe are encouraged by industry action to increase the recycling of paper cups with some major retail chains now offering discounts to customers with reusable cups,\u201d said a ministry spokeswoman.  \u201cWe will carefully consider the committee\u2019s recommendations and respond shortly,\u201d she said.  Caffe Nero said it was working with others to understand and address the issues which prevent the widespread recycling of paper cups.    Costa Coffee and Greggs said they offered a discount to those using reusable cups but Costa said the government also needed to focus on improving recycling infrastructure. Pret A Manger\u2019s customers have benefited from a 50 pence discount from this week.  U.S chain Starbucks will trial a 5 pence levy at up to 25 London branches in February for three months.   \u201cWe will investigate the impact of a 5p charge on a paper cup, coupled with prominent marketing of reusable cups, on customer behavior,\u201d it said in a statement posted on its website.

          "body": "ATHENS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A court in Cyprus sentenced the former chief executive of Bank of Cyprus to 2-1/2 years in prison on Friday for misleading shareholders on its capital needs immediately prior to the country\u2019s financial meltdown in 2013.  Andreas Eliades, who resigned from the bank in 2012, had been found guilty by the island\u2019s criminal court of issuing misleading statements about the lender which was hit heavily by its exposure to debt-laden Greece.  The court also fined Bank of Cyprus 120,000 euros ($144,888.00). Four other executives at the bank were found not guilty, the semi-official Cyprus News Agency said.  Eliades, at the helm of the bank for about eight years, was accused of understating a capital shortfall at the bank. At an annual shareholder meeting in June 2012, Eliades said the bank had a 200 million euro shortfall. This was revised considerably higher in a letter he penned to the governor of Cyprus\u2019s central bank the following day, the court said.  The value of Greek government bonds were written down in early 2012 in an EU-sanctioned move to make that country\u2019s debt mountain more manageable. It dealt a heavy blow to Cypriot banks, and snowballed into a fiscal crisis.  Bank of Cyprus recapitalised by converting a percentage of uninsured deposits above 100,000 into equity in 2013. It was a condition of a 10 billion euro international bailout extended to the Mediterranean island by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.  The bank\u2019s senior management has been completely overhauled since then, and its shareholder structure altered. ($1 = 0.8282 euros) (Writing by Michele Kambas; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)"

          "title": "Hedge funds have British motor dealer vulnerability in their sights",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds are circling British car dealers, betting on their increasing vulnerability as a five-year sales boom hits the skids in the face of waning consumer confidence and an accompanying drop in resale values.  UK new car sales registered the biggest annual drop since 2009 last year, data showed on Friday, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) predicting an even bigger decline this year.   Fallout from Volkswagen\u2019s (VOWG_p.DE) 2015 diesel scandal has taken a heavy toll, with UK demand for diesel cars tumbling by 17 percent last year on consumer fears over potential new charges, while post-Brexit uncertainties and lower resale values pose a risk to sales of both petrol and diesel cars.   Steep sales declines had already forced a profit warning from motor dealer Pendragon (PDG.L) in October, and rival Lookers (LOOK.L) said in November that its car manufacturer partners were reducing sales targets to ease pressure on the company.   Shares in Pendragon, Lookers and listings website Autotrader (AUTOA.L), which has the car dealers as major clients, all ended 2017 down more than 10 percent, against a rise of 8.8 percent for the FTSE 350 index .FTLC.   Some investors are betting on even steeper declines, selling borrowed shares into the market in the hope of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference, known as short-selling.  Hedge funds including GLG and Wellington Management are shorting the shares of Lookers, Pendragon and Autotrader, according to filings with Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).   Share prices of Pendragon, Lookers and fellow dealer Vertu Motors (VTU.L), were down by as much as 4 percent after Friday\u2019s release of the 2017 sales numbers.   \u201cThere are concerns around Brexit and the general economic outlook,\u201d said Randeep Grewal, a fund manager at hedge fund Trium Capital, who has taken short positions in the automotive sector.   \u201cPeople tend to be less keen to buy cars when they have more job uncertainty and rising interest rates.\u201d   Analysts have cut their mean price targets on Pendragon\u2019s shares by 40 percent in the past three months, Reuters data shows, while price targets on Lookers and Vertu have fallen nearly 20 percent over the same period.   Not all analysts take such a gloomy view of the dealers\u2019 prospects, however.  Liberum\u2019s Adam Tomlinson, who covers UK motor retailers, recommends investors should buy shares in all three companies.  \u201cMost people have (already) factored declines this year into their numbers,\u201d he said.    But bets on further sharp falls are still growing. Short positions on Pendragon have nearly trebled since the end of November, according to the FCA.   Another factor latched upon by the short-sellers is the threat to car finance packages that, thanks to a decade of cheap credit, now account for nearly 90 percent of new car purchases \u2013 nearly double the figure in 2006.  Under one of the most popular financing options, known as \u201cpersonal contract plans\u201d (PCPs), customers pay a small deposit to lease a car, making lower monthly payments than under a traditional hire-purchase scheme, with the option to return the car at the end of the contract.   The risk is that oversupply of used cars in the UK is about to hit the resale prices of cars on which PCP rates are partly based. PCP repayment rates would rise, further choking off demand for new vehicles and hitting dealer profit margins, which can already be as narrow as 2 percent.   Lookers and Pendragon derive the vast majority of their profits from the UK and Ireland, making them more exposed to a British downturn than the more geographically diverse auto manufacturers.   \u201cPCPs have been a big driver in pushing up the average price of a car,\u201d Trium Capital\u2019s Grewal said. \u201cIt allows you to afford a more expensive model.\u201d  Last month analysts at JP Morgan warned clients that PCPs had resulted in \u201cunsustainably high volumes of premium vehicle sales\u201d.

          "title": "UK productivity growth hits six-year high after weakest decade since 1820s",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s economic productivity perked up in the three months to the end of September, growing at its fastest rate in more than six years, in contrast to its historically weak performance over the previous decade.  Productivity in Britain has stagnated since the global financial crisis even more than in most other advanced economies, and has played a key role in squeezing Britons\u2019 living standards.  Over the past 10 years productivity growth was the weakest since modern records began and appears to be the slowest since the early 1820s, when Britain was emerging from the Napoleonic wars, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday.      During the third quarter of 2017, output per hour worked grew by 0.9 percent compared with the three months before, its first rise since late 2016 and the biggest increase since the second quarter of 2011, the ONS said.  However, the upturn reflected a fall in the number of people in work over the period rather than strong economic growth, which was a lackluster 0.4 percent.  Britain\u2019s economy slowed last year, despite strong global growth, as the plunge in the pound that followed its 2016 vote to leave the European Union triggered higher inflation that hurt consumer spending.  The uncertainty generated by Brexit has also weighed on businesses\u2019 willingness to invest.  Productivity dropped in the first half of 2017 as businesses hired staff faster than they increased output. Compared with a year before, third-quarter productivity was just 0.8 percent higher, less than half its pre-crisis growth rate.  Late last year Britain\u2019s government forecasters revised down their long-run productivity forecasts to around 1 percent a year, after previous expectations for it to pick up to nearer 2 percent were repeatedly disappointed.  A weaker productivity outlook also drove the BoE\u2019s decision in November to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, as it judged the economy would struggle to grow much faster than 1.5 percent a year without creating excessive inflation.  That said, Friday\u2019s data showed unit labor costs - a measure of how much it costs to produce a given amount of output, and a key driver of inflation - rose by the least since the second quarter of 2015, increasing 1.3 percent.  Howard Archer, an economist at forecasters EY ITEM Club, said productivity was likely to have recovered further in the final three months of 2017. Early indications suggest growth remained solid while the number of people in work fell.  But he was less positive about the longer term.  \u201cA major risk is that prolonged uncertainty and concerns over the UK\u2019s economic outlook ends up weighing down markedly on business investment and damages productivity,\u201d he said.  Britain\u2019s government has launched repeated efforts to boost productivity, and says past weakness is partly due to strong job creation, which has pushed unemployment to its lowest in more than 40 years.  ONS data also show a drag from the declining North Sea oil and gas sector, and from heavy losses in financial services after the global crisis. Low investment and inconsistent management quality also weigh on productivity, economists say.  Graphic by Andy Bruce; Editing by Gareth Jones"

          "body": "TBILISI (Reuters) - A Georgian court sentenced former leader Mikheil Saakashvili in absentia to three years in prison on Friday for seeking to cover up evidence about the murder of a Georgian banker when he was president - a verdict which he denounced as illegal.  Georgia said it would seek the extradition of Saakashvili, who was president from 2004-2013, from Ukraine where he is an active opposition figure and has had violent brushes with authorities.  A court in the Georgian capital Tbilisi found Saakashvili  guilty of abusing his presidential powers by trying to cover up evidence about the 2006 murder of banker Sandro Girgvliani and pardoning four men convicted of the killing.  Saakashvili called the verdict illegal.  \u201cThe \u2018verdict\u2019 of the Georgian court ... against me is completely illegal and contradicts all international, national norms and common sense,\u201d Saakashvili wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.  Ukraine said it would consider Georgia\u2019s extradition request though legal procedures would have to be followed.  \u201cProsecutors are in the process of arranging a date for Saakashvili\u2019s questioning due to Georgia\u2019s request to extradite him,\u201d Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian prosecutor general, told Reuters by phone in Kiev.  The 50-year-old Saakashvili, a mercurial figure, moved to Ukraine in 2014.  His support for Ukraine\u2019s pro-Europe Maidan movement, which forced a Russian-backed president to flee the country, won him favor from incoming President Petro Poroshenko who appointed him governor of the Black Sea Odessa region.  But he has fallen out badly with his former patron in Ukraine after accusing him of corruption and is under suspicion of assisting a criminal organization, which he denies.  He attracts big crowds to rallies in Ukraine and there have been occasional violent clashes between his supporters and police in Kiev.

          "title": "Fitch Rates Rede D'Or's Senior Unsecured Notes 'BB+(EXP)'",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB+(EXP)' rating to the proposed senior unsecured bonds up to BRL500 million due in 7 or 10 years to be issued by Rede D'Or Finance S.a. r.l., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rede D'Or Sao Luiz S.A. (Rede D'Or) and is incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The notes will be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Rede D'Or and will rank pari passu with its existing unsecured debt. The issuance's net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of indebtedness, capital expenditures and/or to increase liquidity. Fitch currently rates Rede D'Or's Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BB+'/Negative, and LT Local Currency IDR 'BBB-'/Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Rede D'Or's ratings reflect its strong competitive position in the fragmented hospital industry in Brazil, its prominent business scale, modest leverage, strong liquidity and the defensive nature of its business fundamentals across economic cycles. The company's recent operating performance has proven resilience to the economic downturn. The increasing imbalance between available supply of hospitals and demand for these services is also a positive consideration, as is the ability of the company to pass along rising costs to its clients. Among the company's main challenges is its ability to efficiently manage working capital needs, since counterparties are facing more cash flow pressure. The company's strong business scale and bargaining power mitigate some of this risk. The need for constant investment in technology and equipment renewal, as well as potential regulatory issues, are seen as manageable risks Fitch expects Rede D'Or to continue to cautiously manage its strong business growth (organic and inorganic) and dividends distribution in a manner that results in solid leverage metrics. Fitch's base case scenario forecasts around BRL1billion-BRL1.5 billion in acquisitions during the next three years, and net adjusted leverage ratios of slightly above 2.0x. The ratings also reflect Fitch's expectation that Rede D'Or will remain disciplined in maintainlng a robust liquidity position as part of its proactive liability management strategy to mitigate refinancing risks. The Rating Outlook for the Foreign Currency rating remains Negative and mirrors Fitch's Negative Outlook for the Brazilian sovereign (FC IDR BB). Rede D'Or's FC IDR is capped by Brazil's Country Ceiling of 'BB+', as it operates only in Brazil. KEY RATING DRIVERS Leading Business Position: Rede D'Or is the largest private hospital networks in Brazil's fragmented and underdeveloped hospital industry. The company owns 35 hospitals, manages one and has three under construction. The company has solid business positions and large scale operations in its key markets: Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Brasilia and Recife. Business scale is a key issue in this industry and supports Rede D'Or's ratings, as it allows for lower fixed-costs and provides significant bargaining power with counterparties and the medical community in general. Geographic Concentration: Geographic concentration in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo is partially mitigated by robust economic activity in these regions compared with other parts of Brazil, as well as the strength of the health insurance companies. Since early 2015, there is a new regulatory framework for the Brazilian hospital industry that allows foreign-interest ownership, which could increase competition in the long term. Nevertheless, Rede D'Or's strong brand and large business scale in the cities in which it operates are competitive advantages, and it will be difficult for new entrants to replicate its position in the medium term in these key markets. Focused on Growth: Rede D'Or is expected to continue to pursue both organic and inorganic growth. The company has an aggressive track record of acquisitions. From 2010 to September 2017, Rede D'Or acquired 21 hospitals, adding 2,900 operating beds. Since 2015, Rede D'Or has had two new shareholders, HPT Participacoes SA (Carlyle Group), which provided a capital injection of BRL1.8 billion, and Pacific RDSL Participacoes (GIC Group). Solid Profitability: Rede D'Or has been efficient in increasing profitability through economies of scale and achieving synergies from its acquisitions. The company's net revenue grew 118% between 2013 and the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2017, while average operating beds expanded by 44% to 5,200. During this period, the company's occupancy rate ranged from 77% to 81%, while its EBITDAR margin expanded to 27% from 19%. Rede D'Or's operating margin is among the highest of its hospital peers globally. Negative FCF: Rede D'Or's challenge is to effectively increase its FCF, which compares poorly to other investment-grade peers. Nevertheless, Fitch believes the company has flexibility to reduce dividends or to carefully manage acquisitions in order not to jeopardize its credit metrics. Per Fitch's calculations, the company's pro forma EBITDAR substantially increased to BRL2.7 billion in the LTM 2017 from BRL777 million in 2013. While its funds from operations (FFO) were BRL1.6 billion during the LTM, its CFFO was only BRL634 million due to high working capital requirements, which is a business characteristics. FCF generation has been historically negative, averaging negative BRL410 million between 2013 and 2016. During the LTM, FCF was negative BRL1.1 billion, pressured by BRL979 million of dividend distributions. Under Fitch's base case scenario, Rede D'Or's CFFO, EBITDAR and FCF for 2017 are expected to be approximately BRL600 million, BRL2.8 billion and negative BRL1.1 billion, respectively. Modest Leverage: The mix of equity and profitability gains has been supporting Rede D'Or's deleveraging process. Until 2014, most of Rede D'Or's growth was financed through debt. The company's FFO adjusted leverage reached 3.4x as of the LTM, while its net adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio was 2.4x for the same period. These ratios compare with averages of 4.2x and 3.8x, respectively, between 2012 and 2015. Fitch's base case scenario considers the company continuing to benefit from improvements in operating cash flow generation and being able to maintain net adjusted leverage ratios of around 2.2x over the next three years. DERIVATION SUMMARY Rede D'Or has a relatively better business risk profile than its peer in the Brazilian healthcare industry - Diagnostico da America S.A., rated 'AA+(bra)', due to the much lower competitive pressure it faces. In terms of business scale, they both have sound bargaining power with the healthcare providers and insurance companies in Brazil and a strong brand in the industry. Relevance of its business where it operates is a key competitive advantage when discussing payments and pricing with counterparties. Rede D'Or faces higher technological risk but Fitch considers it to be manageable at this time. Both companies are showing an aggressive growth strategy. From a financial risk perspective, Rede D'Or shows lower leverage and greater financial flexibility, considering its ability to manage FCF generation, reducing growth or dividends distribution. On a global basis, the dynamics of the hospital industry in Brazil as well as the regulatory model are quite different compared to those in others countries, which means such a comparison is not really appropriate. On a financial basis, Rede D'or's operating margins and financial metrics look quite sound compared to others rated hospitals within Fitch's global universe. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --BRL1.4 billion in acquisitions up to 2019; --EBITDAR margins of around 28%; --Continued high working capital needs, pressuring CFFO; --Capex of BRL800 million in 2017 and an average BRL1.3 billion to 2019; --Dividends of 25% of net income. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action: Because of Rede D'Or's strong growth strategy, which has pressured FCF, Fitch does not expect a positive rating action in the medium term. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action: --EBITDAR margins declining to below 24%; --Deterioration of sound liquidity position, with cash/short-term debt ratio below 1.0x on consistent basis, leading to refinancing risk exposure; --Net adjusted leverage consistently above 2.7x; --A change in management's strategy with regard to its conservative capital structure could also lead to a downgrade, as could deterioration in the company's reputation and market position. LIQUIDITY Robust Liquidity: Rede D'Or has a track record of keeping strong cash balances, with an average coverage of cash/short-term debt of 2.3x during the last three years. As of Sept. 30, 2017, the company had BRL6.9 billion of debt, of which BRL679 million is due in the short term. In Fitch's view, Rede D'Or's cash on hand (BRL2.9 billion) is sufficient to support debt amortization until to mid-2020. Fitch expects that Rede D'Or will remain disciplined as to its liquidity position and will maintain its proactive approach in liability management to avoid exposure to refinancing risks. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following expected rating: Rede D'Or Finance S.a. r.l. --Senior unsecured notes 'BB+(EXP)' due in 7 or 10 years. Fitch currently rates Rede D'Or as follows: --Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'BB+'; --Long-Term Local Currency IDR at 'BBB-'; --National Long-Term rating at 'AAA(bra)'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Rede D'Or's FC IDR is constrained by Brazil's 'BB+' Country Ceiling, and its Negative Outlook follows Fitch's Negative Outlook for Brazil's sovereign rating (FC IDR BB). Rede D'Or operates only in Brazil. The company does not have stand-by credit facilities abroad.

          "body": "* U.S. economy adds 148,000 jobs in Dec vs est. 190,000  * Average hourly earnings rise 0.3 percent  * Cisco rises after upgrade  * Futures up: Dow 88 pts, S&P 9.25 pts, Nasdaq 31.25 pts (Adds details on jobs data, comment, updates share prices)  By Sruthi Shankar  Jan 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open higher on Friday as investors looked beyond weaker-than-expected U.S. job additions in December and took support from signs of a pick-up in wage growth.  Stock futures pared gains briefly after the data that showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs, compared with economists\u2019 expectation of a 190,000 rise.  The numbers were also in contrast to Thursday\u2019s data that showed private employers added a stronger-than-expected 250,000 jobs in December.  However, the rise in monthly wage gains pointed to labor market strength.  Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent in December after gaining 0.1 percent in the prior month. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent in November.  \u201cIt\u2019s a really weak number, surprising given how strong ADP was on Wednesday. However, it\u2019s only one month. People usually look at the three-month average as it\u2019s usually a better gauge,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer of Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.  \u201cThe market will probably overlook this for now. I would look next month for confirmation if it\u2019s a trend.\u201d  At 8:39 a.m. ET (1439 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 88 points, or 0.35 percent, with 20,303 contracts changing hands.  S&P 500 e-minis were up 9.25 points, or 0.34 percent, with 128,558 contracts traded.  Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 31.25 points, or 0.47 percent, on volume of 27,225 contracts.  The blue-chip Dow industrials closed above 25,000 for the first time on Thursday, its quickest 5,000-point climb since the index was created in 1896.  St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Thursday the U.S. tax overhaul is already pushing up equity prices and is likely to boost growth and investment, but should not force the central bank to raise interest rates any faster than expected.  The Fed expects to hike rates thrice in 2018, but it is doubtful that investors have priced in as many.  Among stocks, Francesca\u2019s Holdings tanked about 20 percent premarket after the women\u2019s apparel and accessories maker said it expected up to 17 percent decline in current-quarter same-store sales.  Schlumberger fell 0.8 percent and Chevron 0.5 percent tracking a 1 percent fall in oil prices on soaring U.S. production.  Cisco rose 2.3 percent after BofA Merrill Lynch brokers upgraded the stock to \u201cbuy\u201d.

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Oman\u2019s government has signed to obtain 81 million Omani rials ($210 million) of financing from Saudi Arabia for one of its key industrial projects, in a deal that could help to ease concern about the health of the sultanate\u2019s finances.  The money will come from the Saudi Fund for Development, a state agency, to support work at Duqm, where Oman is building a multi-billion-dollar industrial zone on its southern coast, the official Oman News Agency (ONA) said late on Thursday.  Oman, whose debt is rated junk by Standard & Poor\u2019s, is running a state budget deficit of about $8 billion due to low oil prices. Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf states promised in 2011 to provide $10 billion of aid to Oman, but the money has been slow to come and only a fraction has been disbursed.  This week\u2019s deal for aid to Duqm may reassure investors that Oman can continue to count on Saudi financial support, even though Muscat has taken different positions than Saudi Arabia on some major diplomatic issues.  For example, Oman maintained close ties with Iran as tensions between Tehran and Riyadh escalated last year, and the sultanate has expanded business ties with Qatar since Saudi Arabia imposed an economic boycott on Doha last June.  The 81 million rials of aid for Duqm is part of the $10 billion regional program, ONA said without giving financial details. Twenty million rials will go towards building a road and 61 million rials towards developing Duqm\u2019s fishing harbor.  Oman plans to make Duqm a major center for its fishing and fish processing industries, in addition to building an oil refinery, a petrochemical complex and a wide range of manufacturing facilities in the zone.  ONA quoted Yousef bin Ibrahim al-Bassam, managing director of the Saudi fund, as saying it had also allocated $150 million to finance the growth of smaller companies in Oman, and would extend the aid in cooperation with Oman Development Bank.

          "body": "CAIRO (Reuters) - A hot air balloon crashed near the southern Egyptian city of Luxor, killing a South African tourist on board and injuring several others on Friday, officials said.  State media blamed the crash on poor weather conditions without elaborating. High winds and sandstorms hit regions across the country, clouding the skies at Cairo\u2019s main airport and forcing the closure of a number of Red Sea ports.  A South African man died and an Argentinian and two French tourists were being treated in hospital, a health ministry spokesman said. Health officials and state media had earlier said a woman died.  A number of other tourists were also taken to Luxor International Hospital but released after a few hours, the ministry said.  Luxor, a city surrounded by ancient tombs and other historic sites, is one of the main focuses of Egypt\u2019s tourism industry - a key revenue-earner that the government has been trying to revive after years of political turmoil.  The balloon had deviated from its allotted path and crashed with 20 tourists on board, the Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement.  Twenty-one other balloon trips carrying more than 400 tourists had all landed safely on Friday, it added.  Sandstorms lashed wide parts of the country, including Cairo, Sinai and coastal areas overlooking the Red sea, the national weather forecasting agency said.  Luxor governor Mohamed Badr ordered the closure of all highways linking to other provinces due to poor visibility.  Staff at Cairo International Airport said they were on high alert because of the strong winds and storms, though no trips were canceled or rescheduled.   Nineteen people, most of them Asian and European tourists, died near Luxor in 2013 when a hot air balloon caught fire and crashed after a mid-air gas explosion.

          "body": "PARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Turkey took a step on Friday towards closer defence cooperation with France and Italy with a contract for a study into the development and production of a long-range air and missile defence system.  Turkey awarded the 18-month contract to the Franco-Italian Eurosam consortium and its Turkish partners Aselsan and Roketsan, Eurosam said in statement.  The study, which Eurosam announced on the sidelines of a meeting in Paris of French President Emmanuel Macron and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan, is to lay the ground for a development and production contract.  The three-country missile programme is scheduled to be ready by the middle of the next decade and aims to defend against threats from stealth aircraft, drones and missiles, Eurosam said. \u201cThe joint development activity is expected to support Turkey\u2019s indigenous air and missile development programme in addition to opening up prospects for exports and longer-term co-operation of Turkey, Italy and France,\u201d Eurosam said.  The Eurosam consortium is made up of European missile maker MBDA, itself a joint venture between Airbus and Italy\u2019s Leonardo and Britain\u2019s BAE Systems, and French defence contractor Thales, whose main shareholders are the French state and fighter jet maker Dassault Aviation .  The French, Italian and Turkish defence ministers signed a letter of intent in November on cooperation in joint defence projects.  Erdogan had said earlier on Friday that he would discuss defence cooperation with NATO ally France during his visit to Paris, highlighting an \u201cimportant\u201d step which Turkey would be taking with Eurosam without giving any details.

The dollar index - the dollar measured against six other top world currencies - was flat after trading marginally higher before the jobs numbers.  In equities, Dow e-minis were up 0.3 percent, and S&P 500 e-minis 0.26 percent higher.

          "title": "Exclusive: Renault-Nissan sets up $200 million fund to tap startups: sources",
          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance is pooling $200 million in a new mobility tech fund, three sources said, in the latest move by major carmakers to adapt to rapid industry change by investing in startups through their own venture capital arms.  The fund, due to be unveiled by Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn at the CES tech industry show in Las Vegas next Tuesday, will be 40 percent financed by Renault (RENA.PA), 40 percent by Nissan (7201.T) and 20 percent by Mitsubishi (7211.T).  \u201cIt will allow us to move faster on acquisitions ahead of our competition,\u201d one of the alliance sources told Reuters.  Frederique Le Greves, a spokeswoman for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, declined to comment.     The traditional auto industry model based on individual ownership is threatened by pay-per-use services such as Uber, as well as ride- and car-sharing platforms, a challenge heightened by parallel shifts towards electrified and self-driving cars.  Wary carmakers are struggling to embrace changes and technologies that some of their executives are only beginning to grasp. To accelerate the process, many are investing directly in the new services - and gaining access to intellectual property - via their own corporate venture capital (CVC) funds.  BMW (BMWG.DE) has purchased stakes in a plethora of ride-sharing, smart-charging and autonomous vehicle software firms through its 500 million euro ($600 million) iVentures fund, the biggest such in-house facility belonging to a carmaker.  Among others that have been increasingly active are General Motors\u2019 (GM.N) GM Ventures, with $240 million, and Peugeot-maker PSA Group\u2019s (PEUP.PA) 100 million-euro investment arm.  CVC funds, a familiar feature of innovative sectors such as tech and pharmaceuticals, have become more commonplace among carmakers since the 2008-9 financial crisis. They let companies skip some of the formalities otherwise required for new investments, and pounce more swiftly on promising startups.  The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi venture will also obviate the current need to thrash out the ownership split for each new alliance acquisition.  It represents a further step in the integration of the carmakers as they pursue 10 billion euros in annual synergies by 2022. France\u2019s Renault holds a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn controls Mitsubishi. Ghosn heads Renault and chairs all three.  The fund is being set up as a Dutch-registered joint venture headed by Francois Dossa, a former banker who led Brazil operations for Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and then for Nissan, the same people said. They declined to discuss specific investment plans.  Despite Nissan\u2019s ambitions to market fully autonomous cars by 2022 as well as a robo-taxi service, the Japanese carmaker has largely eschewed startups, preferring partnerships with established players such as software group DeNA Co. (2432.T)  Renault has made several such investments including Marcel, a Paris car-sharing platform, and Jedlix, a Dutch specialist in smart vehicle-charging technology. Renault\u2019s RCI Bank & Services arm took control of car-sharing aggregator Karhoo last year and plans to relaunch the business under alliance ownership.  Most or all of the Renault investments will be transferred to the new alliance venture\u2019s portfolio, the sources said.

          "body": "MADRID (Reuters) - Spain\u2019s Supreme Court ordered on Friday that Catalan separatist leader Oriol Junqueras must remain in custody after over two months in prison while authorities investigate his role in the Spanish region\u2019s independence movement.  In a written ruling, the judges said there was a risk that Junqueras would again commit an offence if he were released as there was no evidence to show he had abandoned \u201cthe path followed so far.\u201d He is being held on allegations of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.  A Dec. 21 election gave separatists a slim majority in the regional parliament in a blow to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had hoped it would quash the Catalan independence movement and resolve Spain\u2019s worst political crisis in decades.   The court\u2019s decision will probably prevent Junqueras from being sworn in at the opening session of the new Catalan parliament on Jan. 17 and complicates the separatist parties\u2019 search for a leader who is neither jailed nor abroad.   Junqueras\u2019s Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left) party emerged from the election as the second largest separatist group, a few seats behind former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont\u2019s Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) party.  Market-friendly unionist party Ciudadanos (Citizens) won the most seats but other unionist parties did not secure enough votes to form a majority.  Puigdemont remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels, though he has said he would return to Catalonia if the Spanish government gave him certain \u201cguarantees\u201d, likely a promise not to arrest him.  After the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Puigdemont tweeted: \u201cThere is a conflict between Catalonia and Spain that must be resolved. We have always opted for peace and dialogue\u201d.   Esquerra lawmakers have said Puigdemont has the right to again be Catalan president, but if he is unable to return from Brussels he should step aside for Junqueras.  Esquerra and Junts per Catalunya, along with a smaller separatist party, have not yet agreed on a coalition.  Rajoy fired both Junqueras and Puigdemont when he imposed direct control over Catalonia after its separatist-controlled government declared independence following an Oct. 1 referendum on secession from Spain, which courts ruled illegal.  Junqueras\u2019s defense, and other separatist leaders, contend that the independence drive was legal and they have criticized the Spanish government and judiciary for what they call a heavy-handed response.  At a court hearing on Thursday, Junqueras said he was a man of peace and dialogue.  However, judges said on Friday they did not believe that his offer of dialogue indicated he would abandon the \u201cconflict with the state.\u201d  Reporting by Jes\u00fas Aguado and Inmaculada Sanz; Editing by Angus Berwick and Adrian Croft"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s economy looks set for a subdued run-up to Brexit, according to a range of indicators that paint a mixed picture at the start of the country\u2019s last full year in the European Union.  Forecasters generally think the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy will continue to expand at a slow but steady pace during 2018, a better prospect than the gloomy predictions made around the time of the shock vote to quit the bloc in mid-2016.  That means Britain is again likely to lag behind a recovering euro zone and most of its wealthy counterparts among the Group of Seven countries.   Predictions vary widely, due to uncertainties about the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the future of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s weakened government.  Forecasts for growth in 2018 range from just 0.3 percent to 2.2 percent with a central view of 1.3 percent, according to a Reuters poll of economists published last month.   Britain lagged every other G7 country in terms of growth over the first three quarters of 2017 and has been outpaced by the euro zone ever since the Brexit referendum.  Business surveys suggest it is likely to have matched the quarterly 0.4 percent economic growth it managed between July and September in the final three months.  That would give a conservative slant to last month\u2019s Reuters poll forecast of 1.5 percent for 2017 as a whole.  With Brexit due in less than 15 months, many think 2018 will be tougher, with the same poll pegging annual average growth for this year at around 1.3 percent.  The Bank of England expects the economy will grow by an above-consensus 1.6 percent in 2018, while the Office of Budget Responsibility predicts 1.4 percent.

The BoE and many economists think that will prove to be the peak, giving some relief to households that have seen the value of their earnings eroded by rising prices.  Helping matters, sterling looks likely to hold around $1.34 to $1.36 through this year, according to a Reuters poll out this week.   Wage growth looks likely to pick up in 2018, although previous forecasts on pay have tended to err on the optimistic side.  House prices are set to extend a slow march higher next year, apart from in London where they are likely to fall.   For the graphic 'UK inflation and wages', click - reut.rs/2CrwkE1  Household spending is the main driver of Britain\u2019s economy and it increased by just 1.0 percent year-on-year during the third quarter of 2017, the weakest rise since 2012.

The union, which also wants a shorter working week, is entitled to stage walkouts after a non-strike period ended on Sunday, and many workers usually respond to its calls for action.  IG Metall fired the opening salvo this week when it called for strikes at companies including sports car maker Porsche.  More are set to follow ahead of a next round of pay negotiations.  Talks have been set for Jan. 11 for workers in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to Volkswagen\u2019s Porsche, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler and automotive suppliers including Bosch.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil prices have risen above $60 per barrel which should accelerate shale drilling and production in the next few months, provided the price increase is sustained.  U.S. crude futures are trading over $60 for all delivery months between February and August 2018, an increase of about 40 percent since the middle of 2017.  And the futures strip for 2019, the benchmark against which U.S. shale producers can execute hedges for next year\u2019s output, is trading over $56, up almost 20 percent on the last six months.  Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources, one of the largest producers in North Dakota and Oklahoma, said last year that prices needed to be above $50 to be sustainable.  Analysis of earnings statements and drilling behavior of the shale firms confirmed most were not breaking when futures prices were below $50.  Breakeven prices for shale vary tremendously between different companies, different basins and even different wells within the same play.  But with futures prices above $60, a much wider range of wells and shale plays should now be profitable.  Futures prices are sending a clear signal to shale firms that they should step up drilling programs and boost output.  Experience shows changes in drilling rates generally follow changes in futures prices with a lag of about 16 to 20 weeks.  Futures prices have been rising fairly consistently for 27 weeks since hitting a trough around $43 in late June 2017.  Drilling rates, as measured by the Baker Hughes rig count, started turning up 19 weeks later, consistent with normal behavior.  The rig count unexpectedly stalled in the second half of December, but the continued increase in futures prices strongly suggests the rig count will start increasing again and should rise at least through March and April.  Shale production is already increasing strongly as a result of the growing number of wells drilled earlier in 2017 and completed in the second half of last year.  Monthly completion rates across the seven major shale plays climbed from 700 in January 2017 to 921 in June and 1,086 in November, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Production from the Lower 48 states excluding the Gulf of Mexico, much of it from shale formations, has surged from 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in January 2017 to 7.0 million bpd in June and 7.7 million bpd in October.  Production from the Lower 48 excluding federal waters in the Gulf is forecast to top 8 million bpd before the end of 2018, according to the Energy Information Administration.  The continued rise in prices makes it more likely the forecast will prove correct and onshore output will top 8 million bpd even earlier this year.  The more U.S. crude prices rise, the bigger the eventual production response is likely to be, which could significantly complicate OPEC\u2019s attempt to draw down global oil inventories.  OPEC must decide how far it is willing to allow prices to rise before increasing shale output threatens both its market share and its plan to reduce inventories.

          "title": "Hedge funds have British motor dealer vulnerability in their sights",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds are circling British car dealers, betting on their increasing vulnerability as a five-year sales boom hits the skids in the face of waning consumer confidence and an accompanying drop in resale values.  UK new car sales registered the biggest annual drop since 2009 last year, data showed on Friday, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) predicting an even bigger decline this year.   Fallout from Volkswagen\u2019s (VOWG_p.DE) 2015 diesel scandal has taken a heavy toll, with UK demand for diesel cars tumbling by 17 percent last year on consumer fears over potential new charges, while post-Brexit uncertainties and lower resale values pose a risk to sales of both petrol and diesel cars.   Steep sales declines had already forced a profit warning from motor dealer Pendragon (PDG.L) in October, and rival Lookers (LOOK.L) said in November that its car manufacturer partners were reducing sales targets to ease pressure on the company.   Shares in Pendragon, Lookers and listings website Autotrader (AUTOA.L), which has the car dealers as major clients, all ended 2017 down more than 10 percent, against a rise of 8.8 percent for the FTSE 350 index .FTLC.   Some investors are betting on even steeper declines, selling borrowed shares into the market in the hope of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference, known as short-selling.  Hedge funds including GLG and Wellington Management are shorting the shares of Lookers, Pendragon and Autotrader, according to filings with Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).   Share prices of Pendragon, Lookers and fellow dealer Vertu Motors (VTU.L), were down by as much as 4 percent after Friday\u2019s release of the 2017 sales numbers.   \u201cThere are concerns around Brexit and the general economic outlook,\u201d said Randeep Grewal, a fund manager at hedge fund Trium Capital, who has taken short positions in the automotive sector.   \u201cPeople tend to be less keen to buy cars when they have more job uncertainty and rising interest rates.\u201d   Analysts have cut their mean price targets on Pendragon\u2019s shares by 40 percent in the past three months, Reuters data shows, while price targets on Lookers and Vertu have fallen nearly 20 percent over the same period.   Not all analysts take such a gloomy view of the dealers\u2019 prospects, however.  Liberum\u2019s Adam Tomlinson, who covers UK motor retailers, recommends investors should buy shares in all three companies.  \u201cMost people have (already) factored declines this year into their numbers,\u201d he said.    But bets on further sharp falls are still growing. Short positions on Pendragon have nearly trebled since the end of November, according to the FCA.   Another factor latched upon by the short-sellers is the threat to car finance packages that, thanks to a decade of cheap credit, now account for nearly 90 percent of new car purchases \u2013 nearly double the figure in 2006.  Under one of the most popular financing options, known as \u201cpersonal contract plans\u201d (PCPs), customers pay a small deposit to lease a car, making lower monthly payments than under a traditional hire-purchase scheme, with the option to return the car at the end of the contract.   The risk is that oversupply of used cars in the UK is about to hit the resale prices of cars on which PCP rates are partly based. PCP repayment rates would rise, further choking off demand for new vehicles and hitting dealer profit margins, which can already be as narrow as 2 percent.   Lookers and Pendragon derive the vast majority of their profits from the UK and Ireland, making them more exposed to a British downturn than the more geographically diverse auto manufacturers.   \u201cPCPs have been a big driver in pushing up the average price of a car,\u201d Trium Capital\u2019s Grewal said. \u201cIt allows you to afford a more expensive model.\u201d  Last month analysts at JP Morgan warned clients that PCPs had resulted in \u201cunsustainably high volumes of premium vehicle sales\u201d.

          "body": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit increased more than expected in November as imports of goods surged to a record high amid strong domestic demand, making it likely that trade will subtract from economic growth in the fourth quarter.  The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap widened 3.2 percent to $50.5 billion. That was the highest level since January 2012 and followed an upwardly revised $48.9 billion shortfall in October.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit increasing to $49.5 billion in November after a previously reported $48.7 billion deficit in the prior month.  Part of the rise in the trade deficit in November reflected price increases. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit rose to $66.7 billion from $65.6 billion in October. The so-called real trade deficit for October and November was above the third-quarter average of $62.0 billion.  That suggests trade will probably subtract from gross domestic product in the October-December quarter. The chronic trade deficit has garnered the attention of Republican President Donald Trump, who has blamed it for the massive loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs as well as moderate economic growth.  The government reported last month that trade contributed 0.36 percentage point to the economy\u2019s 3.2 percent annualized growth pace in the third quarter. The Trump administration believes that a smaller trade deficit, together with deep tax cuts, could boost annual economic growth to 3 percent on a sustained basis.  Imports of goods jumped to a record high of $204.0 billion in November. Capital goods imports were the highest on record. Imports of consumer goods rose to their highest level since March 2015. The strong growth in imports is being driven by robust consumer demand.  The country\u2019s import bill was also pushed up by imports of industrial supplies and materials, which were the highest since January 2015.  Imports from China were unchanged in November. Exports of goods increased 2.3 percent to $200.2 billion in November, the highest on record. There were strong increases in exports of industrial supplies, petroleum and capital goods.  Overall exports of goods are being supported by recent dollar depreciation and a strengthening global economy, which is helping to underpin the manufacturing sector.  Exports to China fell 1.9 percent. The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit rose 0.6 percent to $35.4 billion in November."

          "title": "Chiquita must face jury in Colombian terror-funding case - Miami judge",
          "body": "(Reuters) - In a sweeping summary judgment opinion issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra of West Palm Beach, Florida, rejected Chiquita\u2019s attempt to head off a jury trial of claims the company is liable under the Anti-Terrorism Act for the deaths of six Americans killed by the Colombian paramilitary group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC).  Judge Marra\u2019s ruling means Chiquita is facing a Feb. 5 trial date in the long-running case, which is part of consolidated litigation by U.S. citizens and foreign nationals over Chiquita\u2019s payments to Colombian paramilitary groups. If the trial takes place as scheduled, it will be the first in the consolidated Chiquita litigation \u2013 and the first Anti-Terrorism Act trial against a U.S. corporation.  The plaintiffs who won Wednesday\u2019s summary judgment ruling are family members or representatives of six Americans whom FARC kidnapped and killed in the 1990s, five of them Christian missionaries and the sixth a geologist. The suits accuse Chiquita of providing more than $220,000 in material support to FARC from 1989 to 1999, in payments averaging $32,000 a year. The U.S. government designated FARC as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. Chiquita pleaded guilty in 2007 to engaging in transactions with a different Colombian designated terror group and agreed to pay a $25 million criminal fine.  Chiquita has long portrayed itself, as Judge Marra explained, as a victim of extortion by FARC and other Colombian guerrilla outfits. The company contends it only agreed to make payments to the groups under duress, fearing attacks on workers and infrastructure at banana plantations operated by Chiquita\u2019s Colombian subsidiary. Judge Marra quoted a response from Chiquita lawyer Eric Holder of Covington & Burling (and future attorney general) to the Justice Department\u2019s 2007 assertion that Chiquita\u2019s money helped buy the weapons and ammunition Colombian guerrillas used to kill innocent victims: \u201cThe company quote, \u2018funded terrorism.\u2019 I would agree with that. Yes, in the same way that an extortion victim funds the mafia,\u201d Holder said. \u201cThat money that is extorted from the company and goes to (designated terror groups) is not something that was willingly given. It was given at the barrel of a gun and threats.\u201d  In the ATA case before Judge Marra, Chiquita\u2019s extortion defense translated into legal arguments in a motion for summary judgment that, as a matter of law, the company cannot be held responsible because it did not intend its payments to FARC to facilitate acts of terrorism and because there\u2019s not a clear link between its payments and FARC\u2019s murders. Chiquita\u2019s lawyers at Covington & Burling and Jones Foster Johnston & Stubbs argued that there\u2019s no evidence supporting claims that Chiquita did anything but give in to FARC\u2019s extortionate demands.\u00a0(After Chiquita's summary judgment brief, Blank Rome took over the company's defense. Blank Rome partner Michael Cioffi argued Chiquita's summary judgment case to Judge Marra.)  Judge Marra ruled that a reasonable jury could conclude otherwise. \u201cPlaintiffs allege that Chiquita continuously paid substantial sums of money to the FARC over a nine-year time span, knowing before and during that time of the FARC\u2019s notoriety for extreme violence, its antagonism toward U.S. interests in Colombia, and its targeting of U.S. nationals for ransom kidnappings and murder, including two of the \u2026 missionaries involved in this case,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese allegations support a reasonable inference that Chiquita knew the money it paid the FARC \u2018would be used \u2026 in preparation for\u2019 or to \u2018carry out\u2019 terrorism related crimes, including ransom kidnappings and killings of U.S. nationals in Colombia.\u201d (He did grant Chiquita summary judgment on an alternative theory that the company violated the ATA by engaging in a murder conspiracy.)  The judge said it will be up to a jury to decide whether Chiquita\u2019s payments were a substantial factor in FARC\u2019s operations, considering that the group was awash in cash in the late 1990s. Jurors will also have to decide the factual question of whether Chiquita could have foreseen \u201cthat funneling money to \u2026 FARC would predictably enhance and facilitate its ability to perpetrate such attacks, including those on plaintiffs\u2019 decedents.\u201d  Chiquita, meanwhile, cannot assert as an affirmative defense that it was acting under duress. Judge Marra granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on that defense, holding that no reasonable juror could conclude the company acted under an imminent threat of death or serious injury in making nearly 60 payments to FARC operatives over the course of nine years. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer Jeffrey Talbert of Preti Flaherty Beliveau & Pachios said Chiquita may still argue to the jury that FARC extorted the payments, but the summary judgment ruling means\u00a0those arguments \u201cmay not be legally relevant,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis will make jury instructions cleaner,\u201d Talbert said. \u201cIt takes an issue off the table.\u201d  Only a settlement, Talbert said, will stop the trial from moving forward next month. Pre-trial evidentiary motions have already been briefed, he said.  Based on Judge Marra\u2019s recitation of the facts, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers will be able to show jurors incriminating evidence that Chiquita made a calculated business decision to pay off paramilitary groups - instead of working with the Colombian government to oppose their crimes or pulling up stakes in Colombia \u2013 and cover up the payments. It\u2019s significant, Talbert said, that much of the evidence comes from Chiquita\u2019s own disclosures in the U.S. government investigation of its payments to Colombian paramilitary groups.  In addition to Preti Flaherty, plaintiffs are represented by Osen LLC, which argued the summary judgment motion before Judge Marra, Podhurst Orseck, Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, Kohn Swift & Graf and Von Briesen & Roper.  I emailed Chiquita and Chiquita lawyers John Hall and Jonathan Sperling of Covington for comment on Judge Marra\u2019s decision. None got back to me.  This post has been updated to include Chiquita's new counsel and to clarify comment from plaintiffs lawyer Talbert. The views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News."

Some of the court testimony implicated senior Turkish officials, including Erdogan. Ankara has said the case was based on fabricated evidence.  Without being specific, Erdogan said the case put agreements between the two countries into jeopardy: \u201c....The bilateral accords between us are losing their validity. I am saddened to say this, but this is how it will be from now on.\u201d  Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry on Thursday condemned the conviction as unprecedented meddling in its internal affairs. The row has unnerved investors and weighed on the lira currency, which hit a series of record lows last year.  The court case has put pressure on relations between Washington and the biggest Muslim country in NATO, already strained since a 2016 failed coup in Turkey which Erdogan blames on followers of a cleric who lives in the United States.   Only last week the United States and Turkey lifted all visa restrictions against each other, ending a months-long visa dispute that began when Washington suspended visa services at its Turkish missions after two local employees of the U.S. consulate were detained on suspicion of links to the coup.   The Halkbank executive, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, was convicted on five of six counts, including bank fraud and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions law. The case was based on the testimony of a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab, who cooperated with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of leading a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.  In his testimony Zarrab implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said Erdogan, then prime minister, had personally authorised two Turkish banks to join the scheme.  Turkey says the case was based on fabricated evidence and has accused U.S. court officials of ties to the cleric Turkey blames for the coup attempt. The bank has denied any wrongdoing and said its transactions were in line with local and international regulations.  \u201cThe United States is carrying out ... a chain of plots, and these are not just legal but also economic plots,\u201d Erdogan said.

          "title": "Brookfield Business Partners to buy Westinghouse for $4.6 billion",
          "body": "(Reuters) - A subsidiary of Canada\u2019s Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) (BAM.N) plans to acquire Westinghouse Electric Co LLC, the bankrupt nuclear services company owned by Toshiba Corp (6502.T), for $4.6 billion.  Brookfield Business Partners LP (BBU.N) (BBU_u.TO) said in a statement on Thursday that it and institutional partners would use $1 billion of equity and $3 billion of long-term debt financing to buy the Pittsburgh-based business, its first investment in nuclear power.  The buyers are also assuming Westinghouse\u2019s underfunded pension plan.  New York-listed shares of Brookfield Business Partners were up 3.4 percent in afternoon trading.  The deal is expected to close in the third quarter but will require approval from regulators and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.   Westinghouse has said it is aiming to exit bankruptcy as soon as March, which would allow Toshiba to book tax benefits in the current fiscal year.  \u201cBrookfield\u2019s acquisition of Westinghouse reaffirms our position as the leader of the global nuclear industry,\u201d said Westinghouse Chief Executive Officer Jos\u00e9 Emeterio Guti\u00e9rrez.  Toshiba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The Brookfield group of companies is among the world\u2019s largest investors in stable, long-lived assets such as utilities, real estate, energy and infrastructure.   \u201cAcquiring Westinghouse definitely fits the risk approach they have,\u201d said Mycle Schneider, an energy and nuclear policy consultant in Paris. \u201cThey buy assets in shaky situations.\u201d  Last year Brookfield Asset Management acquired control of two owners of renewable energy projects, TerraForm Global Inc and TerraForm Power Inc (TERP.O), from SunEdison Inc, which had filed for Chapter 11.  In 2016, Brookfield Business Partners converted debt to a large equity stake in a Texas power producer that emerged from Chapter 11 and became Vistra Energy Corp (VST.N). And in November, Brookfield Property Partners BPY.N offered to buy the remaining shares in General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), adding to a large stake it purchased to bring the mall owner out of bankruptcy.  Schneider said he was surprised that Brookfield acquired Westinghouse, given that the company has no other nuclear businesses.  Westinghouse is one the world\u2019s leading suppliers of nuclear fuel, and it provides some form of service to 80 percent of the world\u2019s 450 commercial reactors, according to court records.   Those two business lines generated combined cash flow of $403 million on revenue of about $3.1 billion in Westinghouse\u2019s 2015 financial year, according to court records.  However, the company suffered after it agreed to build two plants in the U.S. Southeast on fixed-price contracts. The project went billions of dollars over budget, and Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in March to escape the contracts.   Construction of new nuclear power plants globally has dropped to the lowest level in a decade following renewed safety concerns after the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.  One of Westinghouse\u2019s unfinished U.S. projects, known as Vogtle in Georgia, will continue with Southern Co (SO.N) replacing the company as the project manager. A South Carolina project known as V.C. Summer was abandoned in July.  The lead utility behind the V.C. Summer project, Scana Corp (SCG.N), agreed on Wednesday to a $7.9 billion takeover bid from Dominion Energy Inc (D.N).  Westinghouse has joined a consortium bidding to provide nuclear power in Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest new markets in the world. Bringing Westinghouse out of bankruptcy could help close a proposed deal for six of the company\u2019s new AP1000 reactors in India.

The gain of 78,600 positions far exceeded the expectations of analysts, who in a Reuters poll had forecast a modest gain of 1,000 jobs from November. The unemployment rate is the lowest since comparable data became available in January 1976.  Part-time employment jumped by 54,900 jobs while 23,700 full-time positions were added. The economy created 79,500 jobs in November, with 49,900 of those being part-time.  December\u2019s gains were focused on the service sector, where employment rose by 72,600, in part due to increased hiring in finance and educational services. The goods sector added just 6,000 jobs, pulled down by a decline of 3,600 positions in manufacturing.  On a year-over-year basis employment increased by 422,500, or 2.3 percent, the most since November 2007. The six-month average for employment growth was 39,400 jobs, up from 33,900 in November.

          "body": "NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Sengwer, a tribe living in the forests of\u00a0western\u00a0Kenya, say  they have faced a fresh round of evictions by Kenyan authorities to pave the way for a European Union-funded project to protect water catchment areas in the region.  Some 100 Kenya Forest Service (KFS) guards started evicting Sengwer people from the\u00a0Embobut\u00a0forest on Dec. 29, activists said, in\u00a0a case that illustrates tensions between indigenous people\u2019s land rights and conservation projects.  \u201cThey took a six-year-old boy and went around burning houses with him after his mother fled. They left him in the forest at night alone,\u201d Milka Chepkorir, an activist from the community, said at a news conference in Nairobi on Thursday.  The KFS said it was not aware of any evictions during the Christmas and New Year period, a position that was corroborated by Kenya\u2019s environment ministry.  \u201cSome people have been trying to erect structures in the forest illegally and we\u2019ve heightened our surveillance,\u201d Dedan Nderitu, KFS head of conservancy\u00a0in the North Rift\u00a0region, told Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  Vincent de Boer, a representative at the EU Commission in Nairobi, said they had been informed by the KFS that guards in Embobut forest were there to deal with cattle rustlers from the neighboring Pokot and Marakwet communities, not for evictions.  \u201cThis being said the EU will take independent measures to ascertain the facts,\u201d de Boer said in an emailed statement.   The Sengwer hunter-gatherers have fought with the government for more than five decades for the right to live in the Embobut forest in the Cherengany Hills from where they were first evicted by British colonialists in the 19th century.  Rights group Amnesty International wrote to Kenya\u2019s environment ministry\u00a0this week with\u00a0reports\u00a0it had received\u00a0from Sengwer community members and local media that KFS guards burnt at least 15 huts, fired shots in the air and shot dead several animals.  Amnesty said the December evictions were carried out despite a High Court injunction that forbids the eviction or arrest of Sengwer resident in the forest, pending the hearing of a court challenge to the legality of mass evictions carried out in 2014.  The United Nations and the World Bank criticized the KFS in 2014 for forcibly evicting thousands of Sengwer from the forest by burning their homes, leaving many camped out by the roadside.  \u201cThe approach of KFS is conservation without people,\u201d Clement Lenachuru, a commissioner at National Lands Commission of Kenya. \u201c(But) the Sengwer are also not ready to sit down and discuss. They are becoming antagonistic.\u201d  Sengwer community leaders called on the government to halt\u00a0a\u00a0six-year, 31 million euro ($37 million) program, launched in June 2016 to protect Kenya\u2019s five water towers in the Mount Elgon and Cherangany ecosystems.  \u201cOur government has continued to burn houses and chase our people from our community land. They\u2019d rather kill us on our own land than we go suffer elsewhere,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Yator Kiptum, a Sengwer activist.

          "body": "(Adds details )  MADRID, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Spain\u2019s Supreme Court ordered on Friday that Catalan separatist leader Oriol Junqueras must remain in custody after over two months in prison while authorities investigate his role in the Spanish region\u2019s independence movement.  In a written ruling, the judges said there was a risk that Junqueras would again commit an offence if he were released as there was no evidence to show he had abandoned \u201cthe path followed so far.\u201d He is being held on allegations of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.  A Dec. 21 election gave separatists a slim majority in the regional parliament in a blow to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had hoped it would quash the Catalan independence movement and resolve Spain\u2019s worst political crisis in decades.  The court\u2019s decision will probably prevent Junqueras from being sworn in at the opening session of the new Catalan parliament on Jan. 17 and complicates the separatist parties\u2019 search for a leader who is neither jailed nor abroad.  Junqueras\u2019s Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left) party emerged from the election as the second largest separatist group, a few seats behind former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont\u2019s Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) party.  Market-friendly unionist party Ciudadanos (Citizens) won the most seats but other unionist parties did not secure enough votes to form a majority.  Puigdemont remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels, though he has said he would return to Catalonia if the Spanish government gave him certain \u201cguarantees\u201d, likely a promise not to arrest him.  After the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Puigdemont tweeted: \u201cThere is a conflict between Catalonia and Spain that must be resolved. We have always opted for peace and dialogue\u201d.  Esquerra lawmakers have said Puigdemont has the right to again be Catalan president, but if he is unable to return from Brussels he should step aside for Junqueras.  Esquerra and Junts per Catalunya, along with a smaller separatist party, have not yet agreed on a coalition.  Rajoy fired both Junqueras and Puigdemont when he imposed direct control over Catalonia after its separatist-controlled government declared independence following an Oct. 1 referendum on secession from Spain, which courts ruled illegal.  Junqueras\u2019s defence, and other separatist leaders, contend that the independence drive was legal and they have criticised the Spanish government and judiciary for what they call a heavy-handed response.  At a court hearing on Thursday, Junqueras said he was a man of peace and dialogue.  However, judges said on Friday they did not believe that his offer of dialogue indicated he would abandon the \u201cconflict with the state.\u201d (Reporting by Jes\u00fas Aguado and Inmaculada Sanz; Editing by Angus Berwick and Adrian Croft)"

          "body": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - China Development Bank (CDB), the biggest foreign lender to India\u2019s Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) (RLCM.NS), on Friday withdrew a petition seeking to drag the indebted  telecoms carrier into insolvency.  A lawyer for CDB told the National Company Law Tribunal that the Chinese bank had filed to withdraw the petition. The tribunal allowed CDB\u2019s plea to go forward.  CDB, which is owed around $2 billion along with two other Chinese banks, had filed the petition in November seeking insolvency proceedings against RCom, saying a large amount of loan principal and interest payments was overdue.  After RCom\u2019s debt-reduction plan, including an asset sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd [RELIB.UL], was announced last week, CDB told Reuters that it was in talks with RCom.   Details of the terms of a possible settlement between the Chinese bank and RCom were not immediately known. By 0847 GMT, RCom shares were trading 4.2 percent higher in a Mumbai market that was up 0.4 percent.  Last week, RCom signed a deal to sell most of its wireless assets to Jio in a deal people familiar with the matter said was worth nearly 240 billion rupees ($3.8 billion), subject to final adjustments at the time the transaction closes.  RCom has said it will use proceeds from the deal, expected to close by March, to repay part of the $7 billion it owes to Indian and foreign banks.  As part of an overall debt-reduction plan, RCom Chairman Anil Ambani said RCom would shift 100 billion rupees of debt to a special purpose vehicle housing its real estate assets, including a corporate park in a Mumbai suburb.  RCom still faces two other insolvency proceedings - one by the Indian unit of Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and the other by public relations firm Fortuna - over unpaid dues.  RCom has struggled under heavy debt and reported a string of losses during a price war, triggered by new entrant Jio which is controlled by Anil\u2019s elder brother and India\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani. That prompted RCom to reduce operations by shutting down its wireless business.  As it exits the wireless telecommunications segment, it will be left with a division housing its undersea cable business and internet data centers.  The firm is also looking for an equity injection from global strategic partners for further debt reduction and is in talks to sell a stake in the scaled-down business, RCom said last week.

          "title": "Solar modules stuck at Indian ports due to import duty dispute",
          "body": "NEW DELHI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Solar modules worth more than $150 million are stuck at various Indian ports due to a dispute over their classification and the import tax applicable to them, sources said, which could delay  Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s clean energy goals.  Modi has set an ambitious target of nearly tripling the country\u2019s total renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatt (GW) by 2022, spurring global firms including Japan\u2019s SoftBank and Goldman Sachs to invest in solar projects in the country.  Most of the solar modules come from China, but several consignments are now held up because customs officials have demanded that some of them be classified as \u201celectric motors and generators\u201d, attracting a 7.5 percent duty, not as \u201cdiodes, transistors and similar semi-conductor devices\u201d with no duty.  Two customs officials in the southern port of Chennai confirmed the issue regarding the classification.  C. Narasimhan, president of the Indian Solar Association, said that up to 2,000 solar module containers are now stranded at four major ports.  \u201cPort disruptions like this will hamper the country\u2019s progress towards achieving the target of 100 GW in installed solar capacity by 2022,\u201d said Narasimhan, a former lawmaker.  The Indian unit of Germany\u2019s Enerparc had 30 of its containers stuck at Chennai for three weeks as it finished some \u201cpaperwork\u201d and paid a demurrage - a charge for failing to discharge the ship on time - of about 7 million rupees ($110,471), its Managing Director Santosh Khatelsal said.  The renewable energy ministry has already asked the finance ministry to resolve the matter without disrupting business, said a government official with direct knowledge of the matter.  Any duty is bad news for project developers such as SoftBank-backed SB Energy but good for local solar component makers such as Indosolar and Moser Baer.  Indian manufacturers have struggled to compete with Chinese companies such as Trina Solar and Yingli and have sought anti-dumping duties as well as long-term safeguards.  \u201cThe interests of domestic manufacturers and developers should be protected with least harm,\u201d said the government official, who declined to be named.  \u201cThe dispute has the potential to disrupt deployment by increasing the cost of projects but at the same time might protect the domestic manufacturers.\u201d  The finance ministry is examining a proposal from the renewable ministry to exempt projects bid earlier from paying the duty, the official said.  Spokesmen for the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of New and Renewable Energy declined to comment.  Raj Kumar Singh, the minister for power and renewable energy, recently told parliament that the government was working on remedying the problem.  $1 = 63.3650 Indian rupees\nReporting by Neha Dasgupta and Sudarshan Varadhan; Writing by\nKrishna N.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has begun an investigation into whether the Clinton Foundation conducted \u201cpay-to-play\u201d politics or other illegal activities during Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state, The Hill reported on Thursday, citing law enforcement officials and a witness.  The newspaper said FBI agents from Little Rock, Arkansas, where the foundation began, had taken the lead in the investigation and interviewed at least one witness in the past month. Law enforcement officials told The Hill that additional activities were expected in coming weeks.  In response to a request for confirmation, a Justice Department spokeswoman said the agency did not comment on ongoing investigations.  There was no immediate response to a request for comment by officials at the Clinton Foundation. The organization previously said there was never any trade in policy decisions for contributions.  Democrats have accused Republicans of launching a spurious investigation of Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, to divert attention from Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign and Russia.   The Hill reported that the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the probe was examining whether the Clintons promised or performed any policy favors in return for contributions to their charitable efforts or whether donors promised to make donations in hopes of government outcomes.  The probe may also examine whether any tax-exempt assets were converted for personal or political use and whether the foundation complied with tax laws, the newspaper cited the officials as saying.  A witness recently interviewed by the FBI told The Hill the agents\u2019 questions focused on government decisions and discussions of donations to Clinton entities during the time Hillary Clinton led President Barack Obama\u2019s State Department.  U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked Justice Department prosecutors to decide if a special counsel should be appointed to investigate certain Republican concerns, including alleged wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation and the sale of a uranium company to Russia, according to media reports in November.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 4 (IFR) - REN Finance will begin a European roadshow on Monday to help it garner investor interest ahead of a \u20ac300m no-grow 10-year to refinance a recent M&A deal.  The meetings will end on Wednesday for a deal expected as soon as Thursday.  REN last came to market in October 2016 for a \u20ac200m tap of its \u20ac300m 2.5% February 2025s, which priced at 135bp over mid-swaps. The CSPP-eligible paper was trading at 60bp over on Friday, according to Tradeweb.  One lead said part of the proceeds would go towards refinancing REN\u2019s \u20ac532m acquisition of the natural gas distribution network from EDP Energias de Portugal, which closed in October last year. At the time, REN said it would fund the deal with a \u20ac250m capital increase and debt, including a bridge loan.  After the M&A was first announced in April, Moody\u2019s maintained its Baa3 (stable) ratings, saying REN has the ability to absorb the acquisition and maintain its financial profile.  The borrower, also rated BBB- positive by S&P and BBB stable by Fitch, has mandated Barclays and Deutsche Bank as joint global coordinators, and Banco BPI, Haitong Bank, ICBC Standard and Millennium BCP as joint bookrunners.  The issue will come less than a month after Portugal received a two-notch upgrade to BBB from Fitch, meaning it is now investment grade with two of the three major rating agencies."

          "body": "(Reuters) - Nick Kyrgios turned on the style in time to beat Ukraine\u2019s Alexandr Dolgopolov and set up a semi-final against top seed and holder Grigor Dimitrov at the Brisbane International on Friday.  The mercurial Australian huffed and puffed in a miserable first set but eventually found some rhythm to come through a tricky encounter 1-6 6-3 6-4.  Bulgarian Dimitrov also had to battle hard against Britain\u2019s Kyle Edmund, winning 6-3 6-7(3) 6-4 in two hours and 23 minutes at the Pat Rafter Arena.  Kyrgios, who will be under the home spotlight at this month\u2019s Australian Open, made 36 unforced errors against Dolgopolov but there were 27 winners too.  \u201cAs bad as it is to say, it\u2019s kind of like a tap. I can turn it on when I want to,\u201d the third seed told reporters.  \u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good. I\u2019m hitting the ball well and I\u2019m serving really well. So the first two matches of the year, I\u2019ve got through two tough three-setters,\u201d added Kyrgios, who beat compatriot Matthew Ebdon 6-7(3) 7-6(5) 6-2 in the second round.  \u201cThe only positive I can say about losing that first set (against Dolgopolov) is I\u2019m putting myself in some pressure situations and getting some more court time out there which is good... I\u2019ve got to try and maintain as much energy as I can.\u201d  Dimitrov was in control against Edmund as he took the first set but was dragged into a second-set tiebreak which the Briton edged to set up the decider.  Dimitrov, who survived two match points to beat local hope John Millman in the previous round, needed a solitary break to close out the match.  Kyrgios was joined in the last four by fellow Australian Alex De Minaur as the teenager followed up his win over Milos Raonic by beating American qualifier Michael Mmoh 6-4 6-0.  De Minaur will play unseeded American Ryan Harrison for a place in the final. Harrison was leading 7-6(6) 4-2 when Uzbekistan\u2019s Denis Istomin retired from the contest.

          "body": "TORONTO (Reuters) - Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir took ice dancing gold at their first Olympics in Vancouver eight years ago and silver in their second at Sochi in 2014 before hanging up their skates, certain they had achieved all they could.  However, the lure of the ice \u2014 and of competition \u2014 proved too strong for the legendary Canadian pair, bringing them out of retirement in the 2016-17 season for a record-setting second stint of their two-decade long partnership.  \u201cWhen we thought about the 2018 Olympics and not being there, knowing that physically we still probably had a chance, that just didn\u2019t sit well with us,\u201d the 28-year-old Virtue told Reuters.  \u201cWe\u2019re such competitors and we really would have missed out. Now that we\u2019re back it is just affirmation that we made the right decision. We know we are in the right place.\u201d  At Skate Canada this year, they set a new record score with their routines: a catchy Latin-themed short dance to a medley of Rolling Stones, Eagles and Santana songs, and a powerful, emotive free dance to the \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d score.  They were undefeated until the Grand Prix Final in December, when the French team of Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron took the gold, setting the stage for an Olympic showdown next month in Pyeongchang.  Moir and Virtue were first paired in 1997 by his aunt, their then-coach, and have continued to take nothing for granted ever since, with the 30-year-old even describing himself as \u201cterrified\u201d before their initial comeback event.  \u201cWe were in training, everything felt normal, and we got to the point of competing, which is supposed to be our strong suit,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have all this experience, we\u2019ve done so many shows, and I remember feeling so much electricity running through my body, more than I ever have my whole career. That pressure really got to me and all of a sudden we made a mistake... We didn\u2019t unravel but we were just kind of shocked.  \u201cIt was spooky, a little, but was a good reminder that just because we had success competing in the past doesn\u2019t mean it is a given that we are going to be good again,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to work for it.\u201d  The two have long been known for their rapport, prompting speculation that they are a couple.   Virtue has, however, described their relationship as \u201ccomplicated\u201d \u2014 not like dating, not like siblings and not like a husband and wife. Moir said they grew up together and spent a lot of time in the car, listening to music.  \u201cWhen it comes to skating we have similar tastes,\u201d Virtue said. \u201cWe are open to one another\u2019s ideas as well.  \u201cIf I see Scott passionate about a piece of music and if he has a strong desire to skate to it, it\u2019s likely I will feel the same because there\u2019s something tangible about that energy.\u201d  When they topped the podium in 2010, they became the first, and so far only, ice dancers to win gold on their Olympic debut. In Sochi, they came second to Meryl Davis and Charlie White of the United States, who have since retired.  The pair thrive on competition. Asked if they felt they had a target on their backs, Moir said: \u201cI hope so. I love it.\u201d  Their competitiveness has now been challenged by Papadakis and Cizeron after they lost out to the French pair at the Grand Prix Final.  \u201cNow it\u2019s kind of looking forward to the Olympics, which will be the next time we get to go head-to-head with them, and we\u2019re pretty motivated,\u201d Moir told a news conference after the competition.  \u201cWe\u2019re not a team that likes coming in second, much like them, so it\u2019ll be a pretty intense competition.\u201d  Writing and additional reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by John O'Brien"

          "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - American ice dancers Maia and Alex Shibutani exchange glances and beam as they describe their new programs and their progress since their last Olympic appearance.  The siblings\u2019 bond manifests itself through fluidity and coordination on the ice, where the sister and brother have emerged from the shadows of veteran competitors as medal contenders for the Pyeongchang Olympics next month.  Maia and Alex, 23 and 26 respectively, finished ninth at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, their first Games.  Since then, they have matured and refined their craft, winning a silver and a bronze world championship medal along the way.  \u201cWe have pushed ourselves to prepare for a very important year,\u201d Alex Shibutani told Reuters after he and Maia won the first grand prix ice dance event of the season in Moscow in October.   \u201cNow is our time.\u201d  The Shibutani siblings, who experienced success as a young team, came into their senior careers as the circuit was dominated by fellow Americans Meryl Davis and Charlie White, the defending Olympic champions.  But Davis and White, the three-time Olympic medalists and two-time world champions who haven\u2019t competed since Sochi, announced this year that they would not defend their Olympic title, creating a void the Shibutanis are ready to fill.   \u201cWe had to step up to the plate and develop our own sense of who we are,\u201d Alex Shibutani said.  \u201cRegardless of whether Meryl and Charlie were around, we were just ready to do that at that point in our career.\u201d  Maia introduced the Shibutanis to figure skating, starting as a single skater. Alex, who admits he initially was \u201cnot that into skating\u201d, soon followed.   \u201cI think a lot of our success comes from how close we are and the bond that we have,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI think what we have is very unique.\u201d  Their coach, Marina Zoueva, said that the dancers\u2019 family ties does not mean they never have disagreements, just like in any other sibling relationship.  \u201cIt\u2019s a family project,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cIn the end it helps that they are brother and sister.\u201d  Not performing romantic routines means the siblings have been forced to expand their repertoire and be more creative.  With their bubbly personalities and affinity for social media, the Shibutanis have established a broad base of followers online. Their respective Twitter accounts and a joint \u201cShibSibs\u201d account have a combined total of about 120,000 followers.  They also run a YouTube channel chronicling their daily lives, travels, competitions and costume fittings.  The Shibutanis say their social media habits are a hobby they hope will help popularize figure skating in the United States.  U.S. Figure Skating, the sport\u2019s governing body in the country, has more than 184,200 members, but the sport is far less popular and accessible than others.        The Shibutanis won the Skate America grand prix event in November with 194.25 points, a new personal best.

The Shibutanis are skating their new free program to Coldplay\u2019s \u201cParadise,\u201d a song they say illustrates what they hope awaits.  The program, revealed at the Moscow grand prix event, was conceived at the end of the 2015-16 season when their flagging career got back on track.   The dancers had a breakthrough that season, winning their first U.S. senior national title, their first ISU (International Skating Union) championship event and a silver medal at the 2016 world championships. They had not stepped on the podium at the world championships since 2011.   \u201cOver the last four years, they\u2019ve moved up to a level at which they are competitive,\u201d Zoueva said. \u201cLike they are taking steps on a stairway to paradise.\u201d  The Shibutanis will face stiff competition at the Olympics, including from Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, the defending world champions and three-time Olympic medalists.  \u201cMaia and I, we\u2019ve been on this journey for 14 years,\u201d Alex said.   \u201cIt\u2019s about reaching our paradise and being in that moment on Olympic ice.

          "body": "OSLO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The price of Norway\u2019s farmed salmon is expected to drop to a range of 50-53 crowns per kilo next week for deliveries in Oslo from 54-55 in the current week as output begins to rise, industry sources told Reuters on Friday.  The decline follows two weeks of rising prices during the peak Christmas season.  \u201cPrices are dropping, probably down towards 50 crowns,\u201d said a fish exporter, who declined to be named.  A salmon producer expected a slightly smaller drop in prices.  \u201cIt\u2019s quiet but it seems we will have prices at around 52-53 crowns next week,\u201d he said.  \u201cProduction has recovered after Christmas,\u201d he added.  Final prices for the current week are settled on the Nasdaq Salmon bourse on Tuesday next week.  Salmon prices peaked at around 80 crowns per kilo in early January of 2017 at a time when supply constraints supported prices, but have since fallen as volumes grew.  Norway is the world\u2019s top salmon exporter, and the share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish.  Average production costs for whole fish, including the cost of harvesting, rose by 13 percent to 34.29 crowns per kilo in 2016, according to data from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries.  Leading Norwegian producers include Marine Harvest, Salmar, Leroy Seafood, Grieg Seafood and Norway Royal Salmon. (Reporting by Ole Petter Skonnord, editing by Terje Solsvik)"

          "body": "CALGARY/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The careers of Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford were spiraling out of control a few months ago, casting doubt on their ability to regain form in time for their second and last Olympics.  The Canadian pair have now found their balance after a disappointing seventh-place finish at the 2017 world championships, making some drastic changes in a bid to be medal contenders at the Pyeongchang Games next month.   The 2015 and 2016 world champions parted ways with their coach Richard Gauthier in June, just eight months before Pyeongchang, and added two new members to their coaching staff.   They also revived their free program from the undefeated season they had after the 2014 Sochi Olympics, where they fell short of expectations and finished seventh.  \u201cHitting that low last season can maybe prove to be the best thing that has ever happened to us,\u201d Duhamel, 32, told Reuters last year.  \u201cIt is like you need to take two steps back to take a step forward. It is never fun to go through those experiences, of course, but they are always valuable.\u201d   The pair, which last year missed the world podium for the first time since 2012, cannot pinpoint the moment when things started to sour. Neither do they attribute their troubles to Radford skating with a herniated disc at the worlds, a competition he said was \u201ccompletely exhausting and scary.\u201d  \u201cI have never felt so much fear going into a competition,\u201d Radford, 32, said.  \u201cWhen I look back on that moment, it really does seem to have happened for a reason. Those changes were made because of what happened at the worlds. Time will tell.\u201d  Duhamel and Radford, who won silver in the inaugural team event in Sochi, used the momentum of the Olympic season to win bronze at the 2014 world championships.   They were unstoppable after that.   But the pair\u2019s post-Sochi meteoric success ultimately took its toll.   Duhamel and Radford were finding it difficult to remain original when they were the ones setting the standards. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u201cIn an artistic sport like figure skating, the most difficult thing to do is stay fresh,\u201d Radford said.  In recent years the pair have pushed the boundaries of athleticism with the throw quad Salchow.   In this element of their free program, Radford tosses Duhamel, who spins four times in the air before landing backwards on one foot.   The treacherous jump, if well-executed, could help the pair move closer to Olympic gold.   \u201cWe know what our potential is, if we skate two clean programs we can win that gold medal,\u201d Radford said.   \u201cBut at this point in our careers, leading into the Olympics, it\u2019s like we just want to go out there and have a great experience and a good skate.\u201d  The pair won the Skate Canada grand prix event in October with 222.22 points after having finished second in the short program behind Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany.   The pair finished third at the Skate America grand prix event, with Duhamel falling on the side-by-side jump and putting her hand down on the throw quad Salchow.   They also came in third at the Grand Prix Final in Japan in December, with Duhamel falling on the throw quadruple Salchow.  \u201cWe have a lot of things to improve from this competition as we go their ability forward to the Olympics,\u201d Duhamel told reporters. \u201cI think the most important for us will be to do a clean short program at the Olympics.\u201d  Although Duhamel and Radford recognize their podium potential, their recent trials have made observers question their ability to shine at their last Games.  \u201cI think a lot of people will write us off and we\u2019re fine with that,\u201d Duhamel said. \u201cLet everyone else have the pressure and we can show up, do our jobs and hopefully be back on top.\u201d  Reporting by Steve Keating; Additional reporting by Elaine Lies in Nagoya; Writing by Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty"

          "title": "Record-breaking ice dancers braced for Olympic showdown",
          "body": "NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - When French pair Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron skated to a new world record at last year\u2019s Grand Prix Final, their excellence not only started to seem almost routine but it set the stage for an ice dance showdown at the Olympics  Besides setting a fourth new mark in a little over a month, they also ended the winning streak of world champion Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, two-time Olympians whose comeback had seen them remain unbeaten for more than a year.  Time and again, the youthful pair in their early 20\u2019s, set one record before beating it again just weeks later.  \u201cWe\u2019re very happy about that,\u201d Papadakis told a news conference after the 2017 Grand Prix Final in Japan, when they set another record of 202.16 points for total score.   \u201cWe hope that\u2019s going to continue until the Olympics.\u201d  Until last November, no ice dance team \u2014 not even the venerable Virtue and Moir \u2014 had scored above 200 at all. Now Papadakis and Cizeron have managed the feat on three occasions.  \u201cWe have a special routine that we made up through the years,\u201d Cizeron told a small group of reporters after their Grand Prix victory.  \u201cWe get off the ice after a warmup, we re-tie our skates, just walk around. We rarely sit and we usually just walk holding each other\u2019s hands,\u201d he added.  \u201cWe close our eyes, we really try to get into that bubble that makes the magic come out, and then we go on the ice and they call our names. And that\u2019s it.\u201d  The 22-year-old Papadakis, the daughter of a coach, began skating at three and was paired with the 23-year-old Cizeron before they entered their teens. The match was suggested by her mother, who coached them for several years.  Successful but not especially prolific as juniors, the pair really began hitting their stride in 2014-2015, their second senior season, when topping the podium became routine and they picked up their first world championship title.   But disaster struck in August 2015 when they clipped blades during a practice session causing Papadakis to fall on her head, suffering a concussion so serious that one of her coaches said she was wobbly and having trouble putting words together.   In March 2016, when a skate blade left her requiring stitches to her knee, she said she was still having symptoms.   The 2016-2017 season was also uneven. By then they had been based in Montreal for several years and Virtue and Moir were training at the same rink.   \u201cYou know, Tessa and Scott came back and they\u2019re amazing skaters, it was a hard thing to deal with. They have so much experience,\u201d Papadakis said.  \u201cIt was just a year to learn and to grow. We used that, we used our unsuccessful competitions from last year to learn how to grow out of it, how to become stronger and how to deal with the pressure in a different way.\u201d  So far this season they are undefeated, skating to two Ed Sheeran songs in their sultry short dance routine and an elegiac and passionate free dance to \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d.  \u201cThe choice was made this summer, we weren\u2019t really sure what piece of music we wanted use and we listened to Beethoven at the rink, pretty randomly,\u201d Papadakis said.  \u201cWe both said \u2018wow\u2019, I always wanted to skate to this music and so we were like \u2018why not? Why not now?\u2019\u201d  Noted for their easy unison on the ice, the two are also known for a number of rituals before competing, including looking into each other\u2019s eyes to feel connected.  \u201cIt\u2019s like this is just one big moment,\u201d Cizeron said, referring to the start of any competition.  \u201cIt\u2019s just like a bubble and it feels like from that moment to when the program stops, it\u2019s just one whole moment. We don\u2019t get out of that bubble and that\u2019s what gets us through.\u201d  Reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by John O'Brien"

It is personal and it is in the broader interest,\u201d he told Reuters on Friday. He gave no further details.  The resignation of Asiama, a monetary policy specialist, should have little or no impact on the Ghanaian financial sector nor on the bank\u2019s monetary policy direction, analysts say.  Former governor Abdul-Nashiru Issahaku resigned in March last year, barely three months after the swearing-in of President Akufo-Addo\u2019s government.  Akufo-Addo has since appointed as governor Ernest Addison, a lead economist at the African Development Bank who had previously worked at the Bank of Ghana.  The governor of Bank of Ghana and two deputies are appointed by the president, and although the bank is legally independent, the top three officers are often perceived to be loyal to the appointing political authority.

          "body": "* Lawmakers propose 25-pence charge to fund recycling  * UK should ban the cups if 2023 recycling target is not met  * Plastic bag charge cut use by 83 percent  * Government says working with industry, will consider proposals (Adds Caffe Nero comment)  By Costas Pitas  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain should charge a 25-pence ($0.34) \u201clatte levy\u201d on disposable coffee cups to cut down waste and ban them if a recycling target is not met by 2023, a committee of lawmakers said on Friday.  Less than 1 percent of coffee cups are recycled in Britain because of the tightly bonded plastic liner, the difficulties of recycling packaging which has been in contact with food and drink and a lack of facilities, the lawmakers said.  Chains Pret A Manger, Costa Coffee, Caffe Nero and Greggs alongside U.S. firm Starbucks are among the biggest coffee-sellers in Britain and have rapidly expanded in the last 10 years to meet increasing demand.  Although some outlets give a discount to customers using their own cup, only 1-2 percent of buyers take up the offer, according to parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee which said a \u201clatte levy\u201d was needed instead.  \u201cThe UK throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year; enough to circle the planet five and a half times,\u201d said Chair of the committee, Mary Creagh.  \u201cWe\u2019re calling for action to reduce the number of single use cups, promote reusable cups over disposable cups and to recycle all coffee cups by 2023,\u201d she said.  The committee said that money raised by the charge should help improve recycling facilities and if the 2023 target is not met then disposable coffee cups should be banned.  The Irish parliament is considering banning single-use coffee cups whilst the German city Hamburg said in 2016 it will no longer use coffee-makers with aluminium capsules in its own offices or buildings.  In October 2015, Britain introduced a charge of 5 pence on all single-use plastic bags provided by large shops, which led to an 83 percent reduction in UK plastic bags used in the first year.  On Friday the environment ministry said the government was working closely with the sector and had made progress in increasing recycling rates.  \u201cWe are encouraged by industry action to increase the recycling of paper cups with some major retail chains now offering discounts to customers with reusable cups,\u201d said a ministry spokeswoman.  \u201cWe will carefully consider the committee\u2019s recommendations and respond shortly,\u201d she said.  Greggs did not immediately provide a comment on Friday.  Caffe Nero said it was working with others to understand and address the issues which prevent the widespread recycling of paper cups.  Costa Coffee said it offered a 25 pence discount to those using reusable cups but the government needed to focus on improving recycling infrastructure. Pret A Manger\u2019s customers have benefitted from a 50 pence discount from this week.  U.S chain Starbucks will trial a 5 pence levy at up to 25 London branches in February for three months.  \u201cWe will investigate the impact of a 5p charge on a paper cup, coupled with prominent marketing of reusable cups, on customer behaviour,\u201d it said in a statement posted on its website.

The U.S. investment bank\u2019s weekly round-up of financial market flow tracking data showed $10.1 billion had exited U.S. stocks in the biggest move in more than nine months.  At a global level it was reduced to $4.5 billion by inflows elsewhere and came after $14.4 billion of worldwide buying the week before.  There was also $9.2 billion of inflows into bonds this week - the biggest amount in three months.

A \u201cBull & Bear\u201d sentiment gauge they calculate sits at 6.2, well below the 8 level when alarm bells start to ring.  BAML first-quarter targets are \u201cbullish\u201d, they added, due to expectations of 5 percent-plus U.S. real GDP growth in Q1 and Q2 and 20 percent growth in U.S. earnings per share.

          "body": "MOSCOW, Jan 5 (Reuters) - American ice dancers Maia and Alex Shibutani exchange glances and beam as they describe their new programmes and their progress since their last Olympic appearance.  The siblings\u2019 bond manifests itself through fluidity and coordination on the ice, where the sister and brother have emerged from the shadows of veteran competitors as medal contenders for the Pyeongchang Olympics next month.  Maia and Alex, 23 and 26 respectively, finished ninth at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, their first Games.  Since then, they have matured and refined their craft, winning a silver and a bronze world championship medal along the way.  \u201cWe have pushed ourselves to prepare for a very important year,\u201d Alex Shibutani told Reuters after he and Maia won the first grand prix ice dance event of the season in Moscow in October.  \u201cNow is our time.\u201d  The Shibutani siblings, who experienced success as a young team, came into their senior careers as the circuit was dominated by fellow Americans Meryl Davis and Charlie White, the defending Olympic champions.  But Davis and White, the three-time Olympic medallists and two-time world champions who haven\u2019t competed since Sochi, announced this year that they would not defend their Olympic title, creating a void the Shibutanis are ready to fill.  \u201cWe had to step up to the plate and develop our own sense of who we are,\u201d Alex Shibutani said.  \u201cRegardless of whether Meryl and Charlie were around, we were just ready to do that at that point in our career.\u201d  Maia introduced the Shibutanis to figure skating, starting as a single skater. Alex, who admits he initially was \u201cnot that into skating\u201d, soon followed.  \u201cI think a lot of our success comes from how close we are and the bond that we have,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI think what we have is very unique.\u201d  Their coach, Marina Zoueva, said that the dancers\u2019 family ties does not mean they never have disagreements, just like in any other sibling relationship.  \u201cIt\u2019s a family project,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cIn the end it helps that they are brother and sister.\u201d  Not performing romantic routines means the siblings have been forced to expand their repertoire and be more creative.  With their bubbly personalities and affinity for social media, the Shibutanis have established a broad base of followers online. Their respective Twitter accounts and a joint \u201cShibSibs\u201d account have a combined total of about 120,000 followers.  They also run a YouTube channel chronicling their daily lives, travels, competitions and costume fittings.  The Shibutanis say their social media habits are a hobby they hope will help popularise figure skating in the United States.  U.S. Figure Skating, the sport\u2019s governing body in the country, has more than 184,200 members, but the sport is far less popular and accessible than others.  The Shibutanis won the Skate America grand prix event in November with 194.25 points, a new personal best.  They finished third at the Grand Prix Final in Japan in December for the second straight year despite Alex struggling with one-footed turns known as twizzles.  \u201cWe made \u2013 or I made \u2013 an uncharacteristic error, but at the same time we love this free dance and while we wish we could have performed it better today, we\u2019re very forward focused,\u201d Alex told reporters after the competition.  The Shibutanis are skating their new free programme to Coldplay\u2019s \u201cParadise,\u201d a song they say illustrates what they hope awaits.  The programme, revealed at the Moscow grand prix event, was conceived at the end of the 2015-16 season when their flagging career got back on track.  The dancers had a breakthrough that season, winning their first U.S. senior national title, their first ISU (International Skating Union) championship event and a silver medal at the 2016 world championships. They had not stepped on the podium at the world championships since 2011.  \u201cOver the last four years, they\u2019ve moved up to a level at which they are competitive,\u201d Zoueva said. \u201cLike they are taking steps on a stairway to paradise.\u201d  The Shibutanis will face stiff competition at the Olympics, including from Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, the defending world champions and three-time Olympic medallists.  \u201cMaia and I, we\u2019ve been on this journey for 14 years,\u201d Alex said.  \u201cIt\u2019s about reaching our paradise and being in that moment on Olympic ice. Every time we take the ice, we seize it.\u201d (Additional reporting by Elaine Lies in Nagoya; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)"

          "title": "Olympics-Figure skating-Canada's Duhamel, Radford seek Olympic redemption",
          "body": "CALGARY/MOSCOW, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The careers of Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford were spiralling out of control a few months ago, casting doubt on their ability to regain form in time for their second and last Olympics.  The Canadian pair have now found their balance after a disappointing seventh-place finish at the 2017 world championships, making some drastic changes in a bid to be medal contenders at the Pyeongchang Games next month.  The 2015 and 2016 world champions parted ways with their coach Richard Gauthier in June, just eight months before Pyeongchang, and added two new members to their coaching staff.  They also revived their free programme from the undefeated season they had after the 2014 Sochi Olympics, where they fell short of expectations and finished seventh.  \u201cHitting that low last season can maybe prove to be the best thing that has ever happened to us,\u201d Duhamel, 32, told Reuters last year.  \u201cIt is like you need to take two steps back to take a step forward. It is never fun to go through those experiences, of course, but they are always valuable.\u201d  The pair, which last year missed the world podium for the first time since 2012, cannot pinpoint the moment when things started to sour. Neither do they attribute their troubles to Radford skating with a herniated disc at the worlds, a competition he said was \u201ccompletely exhausting and scary.\u201d  \u201cI have never felt so much fear going into a competition,\u201d Radford, 32, said.  \u201cWhen I look back on that moment, it really does seem to have happened for a reason. Those changes were made because of what happened at the worlds. Time will tell.\u201d  Duhamel and Radford, who won silver in the inaugural team event in Sochi, used the momentum of the Olympic season to win bronze at the 2014 world championships.  They were unstoppable after that.  But the pair\u2019s post-Sochi meteoric success ultimately took its toll.  Duhamel and Radford were finding it difficult to remain original when they were the ones setting the standards.  \u201cIn an artistic sport like figure skating, the most difficult thing to do is stay fresh,\u201d Radford said.  In recent years the pair have pushed the boundaries of athleticism with the throw quad Salchow.  In this element of their free programme, Radford tosses Duhamel, who spins four times in the air before landing backwards on one foot.  The treacherous jump, if well-executed, could help the pair move closer to Olympic gold.  \u201cWe know what our potential is, if we skate two clean programmes we can win that gold medal,\u201d Radford said.  \u201cBut at this point in our careers, leading into the Olympics, it\u2019s like we just want to go out there and have a great experience and a good skate.\u201d  The pair won the Skate Canada grand prix event in October with 222.22 points after having finished second in the short programme behind Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany.  The pair finished third at the Skate America grand prix event, with Duhamel falling on the side-by-side jump and putting her hand down on the throw quad Salchow.  They also came in third at the Grand Prix Final in Japan in December, with Duhamel falling on the throw quadruple Salchow.  \u201cWe have a lot of things to improve from this competition as we go their ability forward to the Olympics,\u201d Duhamel told reporters. \u201cI think the most important for us will be to do a clean short programme at the Olympics.\u201d  Although Duhamel and Radford recognise their podium potential, their recent trials have made observers question their ability to shine at their last Games.  \u201cI think a lot of people will write us off and we\u2019re fine with that,\u201d Duhamel said. \u201cLet everyone else have the pressure and we can show up, do our jobs and hopefully be back on top.\u201d (Reporting by Steve Keating; Additional reporting by Elaine Lies in Nagoya; Writing by Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)"

          "title": "Olympics-Figureskating-Record-breaking ice dancers braced for Olympic showdown",
          "body": "NAGOYA, Japan, Jan 5 (Reuters) - When French pair Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron skated to a new world record at last year\u2019s Grand Prix Final, their excellence not only started to seem almost routine but it set the stage for an ice dance showdown at the Olympics  Besides setting a fourth new mark in a little over a month, they also ended the winning streak of world champion Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, two-time Olympians whose comeback had seen them remain unbeaten for more than a year.  Time and again, the youthful pair in their early 20\u2019s, set one record before beating it again just weeks later.  \u201cWe\u2019re very happy about that,\u201d Papadakis told a news conference after the 2017 Grand Prix Final in Japan, when they set another record of 202.16 points for total score.  \u201cWe hope that\u2019s going to continue until the Olympics.\u201d  Until last November, no ice dance team \u2014 not even the venerable Virtue and Moir \u2014 had scored above 200 at all. Now Papadakis and Cizeron have managed the feat on three occasions.  \u201cWe have a special routine that we made up through the years,\u201d Cizeron told a small group of reporters after their Grand Prix victory.  \u201cWe get off the ice after a warmup, we re-tie our skates, just walk around. We rarely sit and we usually just walk holding each other\u2019s hands,\u201d he added.  \u201cWe close our eyes, we really try to get into that bubble that makes the magic come out, and then we go on the ice and they call our names. And that\u2019s it.\u201d  The 22-year-old Papadakis, the daughter of a coach, began skating at three and was paired with the 23-year-old Cizeron before they entered their teens. The match was suggested by her mother, who coached them for several years.  Successful but not especially prolific as juniors, the pair really began hitting their stride in 2014-2015, their second senior season, when topping the podium became routine and they picked up their first world championship title.  But disaster struck in August 2015 when they clipped blades during a practice session causing Papadakis to fall on her head, suffering a concussion so serious that one of her coaches said she was wobbly and having trouble putting words together.  In March 2016, when a skate blade left her requiring stitches to her knee, she said she was still having symptoms.  The 2016-2017 season was also uneven. By then they had been based in Montreal for several years and Virtue and Moir were training at the same rink.  \u201cYou know, Tessa and Scott came back and they\u2019re amazing skaters, it was a hard thing to deal with. They have so much experience,\u201d Papadakis said.  \u201cIt was just a year to learn and to grow. We used that, we used our unsuccessful competitions from last year to learn how to grow out of it, how to become stronger and how to deal with the pressure in a different way.\u201d  So far this season they are undefeated, skating to two Ed Sheeran songs in their sultry short dance routine and an elegiac and passionate free dance to \u201cMoonlight Sonata\u201d.  \u201cThe choice was made this summer, we weren\u2019t really sure what piece of music we wanted use and we listened to Beethoven at the rink, pretty randomly,\u201d Papadakis said.  \u201cWe both said \u2018wow\u2019, I always wanted to skate to this music and so we were like \u2018why not? Why not now?\u2019\u201d  Noted for their easy unison on the ice, the two are also known for a number of rituals before competing, including looking into each other\u2019s eyes to feel connected.  \u201cIt\u2019s like this is just one big moment,\u201d Cizeron said, referring to the start of any competition.  \u201cIt\u2019s just like a bubble and it feels like from that moment to when the program stops, it\u2019s just one whole moment. We don\u2019t get out of that bubble and that\u2019s what gets us through.\u201d (Reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by John O\u2019Brien)"

          "body": "TORONTO (Reuters) - Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir took ice dancing gold at their first Olympics in Vancouver eight years ago and silver in their second at Sochi in 2014 before hanging up their skates, certain they had achieved all they could.  However, the lure of the ice \u2014 and of competition \u2014 proved too strong for the legendary Canadian pair, bringing them out of retirement in the 2016-17 season for a record-setting second stint of their two-decade long partnership.  \u201cWhen we thought about the 2018 Olympics and not being there, knowing that physically we still probably had a chance, that just didn\u2019t sit well with us,\u201d the 28-year-old Virtue told Reuters.  \u201cWe\u2019re such competitors and we really would have missed out. Now that we\u2019re back it is just affirmation that we made the right decision. We know we are in the right place.\u201d  At Skate Canada this year, they set a new record score with their routines: a catchy Latin-themed short dance to a medley of Rolling Stones, Eagles and Santana songs, and a powerful, emotive free dance to the \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d score.  They were undefeated until the Grand Prix Final in December, when the French team of Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron took the gold, setting the stage for an Olympic showdown next month in Pyeongchang.  Moir and Virtue were first paired in 1997 by his aunt, their then-coach, and have continued to take nothing for granted ever since, with the 30-year-old even describing himself as \u201cterrified\u201d before their initial comeback event.  \u201cWe were in training, everything felt normal, and we got to the point of competing, which is supposed to be our strong suit,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have all this experience, we\u2019ve done so many shows, and I remember feeling so much electricity running through my body, more than I ever have my whole career. That pressure really got to me and all of a sudden we made a mistake... We didn\u2019t unravel but we were just kind of shocked.  \u201cIt was spooky, a little, but was a good reminder that just because we had success competing in the past doesn\u2019t mean it is a given that we are going to be good again,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to work for it.\u201d  The two have long been known for their rapport, prompting speculation that they are a couple.   Virtue has, however, described their relationship as \u201ccomplicated\u201d \u2014 not like dating, not like siblings and not like a husband and wife. Moir said they grew up together and spent a lot of time in the car, listening to music.  \u201cWhen it comes to skating we have similar tastes,\u201d Virtue said. \u201cWe are open to one another\u2019s ideas as well.  \u201cIf I see Scott passionate about a piece of music and if he has a strong desire to skate to it, it\u2019s likely I will feel the same because there\u2019s something tangible about that energy.\u201d  When they topped the podium in 2010, they became the first, and so far only, ice dancers to win gold on their Olympic debut. In Sochi, they came second to Meryl Davis and Charlie White of the United States, who have since retired.  The pair thrive on competition. Asked if they felt they had a target on their backs, Moir said: \u201cI hope so. I love it.\u201d  Their competitiveness has now been challenged by Papadakis and Cizeron after they lost out to the French pair at the Grand Prix Final.  \u201cNow it\u2019s kind of looking forward to the Olympics, which will be the next time we get to go head-to-head with them, and we\u2019re pretty motivated,\u201d Moir told a news conference after the competition.  \u201cWe\u2019re not a team that likes coming in second, much like them, so it\u2019ll be a pretty intense competition.\u201d  Writing and additional reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by John O'Brien"

          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico\u2019s acting attorney general said on Thursday prosecutors were already working to improve investigations and cooperation with other countries following an international report that blasted the country for failing to punish money launderers.   Alberto Elias Beltran, Mexico\u2019s acting attorney general, told Reuters in an interview that the country was seeking to work better with the United States and Colombia to target financial networks of multinational drug gangs.   Earlier this week, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international organization based in Paris that sets global standards for fighting illicit finance, criticized Mexico for not systematically prosecuting money launderers.    \u201cThere are important findings of opportunities for improvement at the attorney general\u2019s office,\u201d Elias said, noting in particular the room to improve the quality of money laundering investigations and the seizure of assets.   The FATF report highlighted that Mexico has been slipping in successful convictions. The country already lagged regional peers such as Colombia and Brazil, both of which have made strides in setting up independent prosecutors.  The report also noted the \u201clow level of effectiveness\u201d in prosecutions and seizures and an \u201cextremely low level of effectiveness\u201d in punishing corruption.   \u201cWe are working with the specialized offices (that target money laundering) where we are strengthening protocols,\u201d Elias said, adding that government agencies were also working to implement so-called parallel investigations.   The FATF report underscored that Mexico was largely failing to carry out parallel money laundering investigations to match probes of organized crime, drug trafficking and corruption.   The FATF recommends such parallel investigations, and its report on Mexico underscored haphazard, uneven results of current investigations, noting low conviction rates and tiny seizures of assets compared with the amount of illicit proceeds that are generated in Mexico.  Elias noted that the FATF report recognized Mexico had improved its legal framework to tackle laundering and credited the country for the recent the emphasis on improving investigations.   Elias pointed to last year\u2019s extradition of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, Mexico\u2019s most notorious kingpin, to the United States as a success. He said Mexico was continuing to work with the United States in order to identify Guzman\u2019s assets north and south of the border.   He also noted that during the last two months Mexico, Colombia and the United States have been working on developing a new computerized method to share information.  \u201cThis will allow us to be much more efficient in investigations and also in the detection of assets, which for us is fundamental to fight the financial structures of all criminal organizations,\u201d Elias said.  Mexico and the United States have been quietly increasing cooperation to fight heroin trafficking since last year. High-level U.S. state department officials have told Reuters that the United States has offered to help fund Mexico\u2019s efforts to eradicate opium poppies.  However, Elias said U.S. aid to Mexico to fight drug trafficking and improve its legal system was small compared with the spending by Mexico.    \u201cMexico has indicated that it has sufficient resources to be able to combat these criminal phenomena in a frontal manner,\u201d he said.

          "body": "* M&S, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons all report on Christmas  * M&S Q3 like-for-like clothing sales forecast down 3.4 pct  * Tesco Q3 underlying sales up 1.7-2.4 pct, Xmas up 2.4-3.2 pct  * Sainsbury\u2019s Q3 underlying sales seen up 0.9 pct  * Morrisons underlying Christmas sales forecast up 1.8 pct  By James Davey  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Marks & Spencer is expected to report another fall in comparable clothing sales in its Christmas quarter, though the major grocers are forecast to report solid trading as cash-strapped consumers prioritised spend on food and drink.  Christmas trading updates from British retailers so far have been mixed. Clothing chain Next provided some initial cheer, beating expectations and upgrading its profit forecast. But the mood was quickly soured by a profit warning from department store chain Debenhams.  With Britons being squeezed by slow wage growth and a jump in inflation that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, overall expectations going into the key Christmas trading period were subdued.  \u201cConsumer confidence is low, and shoppers have exercised extreme caution or shopped strategically online, rather than visiting bricks-and-mortar stores or making impulse purchases. As such retailers, and in particular fashion retailers, have felt a fall in footfall and consumer spend,\u201d said Sophie Michael, head of retail and wholesale at BDO, the business advisory firm.  With investors concerned about a further squeeze on spending in 2018, they will focus on retailers\u2019 comments on the outlook.  For M&S\u2019s third quarter to Jan. 6 analysts are on average forecasting a 3.4 percent fall in like-for-like clothing and home sales - much worse than the previous quarter\u2019s 0.1 percent fall. Analysts are also forecasting a 1.1 percent drop in like-for-like food sales - a fourth straight quarter of decline.  M&S, which said in November it would speed up store closures and re-position its food offer, will likely point to harder comparative numbers with last year in the third quarter compared to the second and the tough overall market when it reports on Thursday.  \u201cLike-for-like declines in both core segments...will not help spark a reassessment of the bear case, but we think the numbers would be respectable given the starting point and the market context,\u201d said analysts at Barclays.  Industry data published in December showed Tesco, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, outperforming its three major UK supermarket rivals - Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons - and entering the key festive period with momentum.  On Thursday it will publish data for its third quarter to Nov. 25 as well as the six weeks to Jan. 6. Analysts forecast like-for-like sales up 1.7-2.4 percent for the quarter and 2.4-3.2 percent for the Christmas period. Tesco\u2019s second quarter UK like-for-like sales rose 2.1 percent.  No. 2 supermarket group Sainsbury\u2019s updates on third quarter to Jan. 6 trading on Wednesday. Analysts are on average forecasting a like-for-like sales rise of 0.9 percent - a slight pick-up from its second quarter.  No. 4 Morrisons reports on Tuesday, with analysts on average forecasting group like-for-like sales up 1.8 percent - a deceleration from its previous quarter but a ninth straight quarter of growth.  While the big quoted retailers appear to have performed respectably, a theme for the period is likely to be a further shift in market share to the German discounters, reflecting defensively minded consumers.  Aldi UK has already reported an over 15 percent year-on-year rise in total December sales, driven by strong demand for its premium ranges. Lidl UK is scheduled to update on Wednesday.  Industry data from researcher Kantar Worldpanel on Tuesday will provide an early guide to Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco\u2019s and Lidl\u2019s performance before their official updates.

          "title": "FOREX-Inflation subdued, but euro still set for 3rd week of gains",
          "body": "* Dollar struggles despite strong ISM, ADP data  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Saikat Chatterjee  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The euro held near four-month highs on Friday as euro zone inflation data printed modestly, in line with forecasts.  Sentiment remained bullish, however, with some investors betting the ECB may have to start withdrawing its stimulus policies earlier than expected as the bloc\u2019s economy strengthens.  Prices rose 1.4 percent year on year last month, or 10 basis points slower than in the previous month due to smaller increases in food and energy prices.  With the dollar failing to draw any strength from this week\u2019s manufacturing and private payrolls data and two U.S. interest rate hikes already baked into market expectations, traders believe there is more upside for the euro.  Markets are now focused on Friday\u2019s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show job gains of 190,000 for December.  December\u2019s euro zone inflation data, meanwhile, underlined that price pressures will have to pick up meaningfully in the bloc before the European Central Bank starts to withdraw policy stimulus rapidly.  \u201cAny rate debate at the ECB is unlikely to be very lively even if GDP growth is healthy,\u201d HSBC strategists wrote in an outlook note.  On Friday, the euro was broadly steady at $1.2060, just shy of a September 2017 high of $1.2092 and on track for a third consecutive week of gains.  A break above that level would take the single currency to its highest since January 2015.  Any near-term shift in the ECB\u2019s policy stance would be a surprise for financial markets, which expect policymakers to wind down their bond purchases later in the year.  \u201cCurrency markets broadly know what the Fed is going to do this year but the ECB monetary policy may be the surprise package of 2018,\u201d said Richard Falkenhall, senior FX strategist at SEB in Stockholm.  Money markets expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates two times this year compared to a Fed forecast of three times.  In contrast, markets don\u2019t expect any change in interest rates in Europe until 2019, though some of those expectations may have been slightly bought forward in recent days after comments by senior ECB policymakers.  The ECB may end its stimulus programme this year if the euro zone economy continues to grow strongly, rate-setter Ewald Nowotny told a German newspaper.  \u201cMarket participants might bank on the ECB following in the Fed\u2019s footsteps earlier after all if the economic environment improves further, which would be a reason to prefer the euro over the dollar,\u201d Commerzbank strategists said in a note.  Weighed down by its weakness against the euro, the dollar\u2019s index against a basket of six major currencies was poised for a loss of 0.3 percent this week.  It probed a three-month low of 91.751 on Tuesday and stood at 91.996, headed for its third week of losses.  The U.S. currency\u2019s lack of traction was highlighted overnight as it failed to draw support from a stronger-than-expected jobs report. U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, data from ADP Research Institute showed, the biggest monthly increase since March.  Also weighing on the dollar was a renewed flattening of the U.S. yield curve with the spread of ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds over two-year debt falling below 50 basis points to its lowest in more than a decade.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Formula One was the fastest growing sports brand across social media in 2017 while television and digital viewing figures also increased, the commercial rights holder said on Friday.  Last season was the first under the ownership of U.S.-based Liberty Media, who are keen to develop the sport and attract new audiences.  Formula One said in a statement that the sport ended the year with a total of 11.9 million followers on its Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube channels \u2014 a rise of 54.9 percent compared to 2016.  The figures also reflect how much ground the sport has had to make up.

Italy showed the biggest rise, of 19.1 percent, out of the top four markets followed by Brazil with 13.4 percent. Britain (3.9) and Germany (0.9) also showed positive growth.  China, a key market that the sport has targeted for future growth, showed an increase of 42.2 percent.  The statement did not provide data for 2016 or numbers for individual countries\u2019 previous audiences to illustrate the growth in the number of people watching.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The powerful rally in global stocks and other markets is likely to persist until higher borrowing costs and a stronger dollar force investors to back off, Bank of America Merrill-Lynch\u2019s analysts said on Friday.  The U.S. investment bank\u2019s weekly round-up of financial market flow tracking data showed $10.1 billion had exited U.S. stocks in the biggest move in more than nine months.  At a global level it was reduced to $4.5 billion by inflows elsewhere and came after $14.4 billion of worldwide buying the week before.  There was also $9.2 billion of inflows into bonds this week - the biggest amount in three months. The breakdown revealed money going into investment grade and emerging markets debt and the first inflows into riskier high-yield bonds in 10 weeks.  Invoking the figure from Greek mythology who flew with wings of wax too close to the sun, BAML\u2019s analyst said: \u201c(The) Icarus melt-up trade isn\u2019t likely over and won\u2019t be until rates (are) a lot higher and (there are) big redemptions in \u2018yield\u2019 plays.\u201d  Mid-way through last year BAML was predicting a \u201cHumpty Dumpty-style big fall\u201d for stocks but seems to have shelved that call for now.  While the analysts stressed there was still a risk of markets overshooting, they said positioning appeared fine for now. A \u201cBull & Bear\u201d sentiment gauge they calculate sits at 6.2, well below the 8 level when alarm bells start to ring.  BAML first-quarter targets are \u201cbullish\u201d, they added, due to expectations of 5 percent-plus U.S. real GDP growth in Q1 and Q2 and 20 percent growth in U.S. earnings per share.  Wall Street\u2019s S&P 500 is seen reaching 2,860 points from its current 2,723 points, Nasdaq to 8,000 from just over 6,000 now and benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rising to 2.85 percent from 2.46 percent now.

          "body": "* Tackle economic problems, cleric urges govt  * Protesters angry at unemployment, rich/poor gap  * Signs emerge that rallies are abating  * Guards step up crackdown on protests  By Parisa Hafezi  ANKARA, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of government supporters rallied across Iran on Friday, swearing allegiance to the clerical establishment and accusing arch enemy the United States of instigating the largest anti-government protests in nearly a decade, state TV reported.  Tehran\u2019s Friday prayer leader called on authorities to deal \u201cfirmly\u201d with those responsible for igniting over a week of illegal rallies, in which 22 people were killed and more than 1,000 people were arrested, according to Iranian officials.  \u201cBut those ordinary Iranians who were deceived by these American-backed rioters should be dealt based on Islamic clemency,\u201d cleric Ahmad Khatami told worshippers at Tehran university, TV reported.  Khatami also called on the government to \u201cpay more attention to people\u2019s economic problems.\u201d  The anti-government rallies erupted on December 28 in Iran\u2019s holy Shi\u2019ite city of Mashhad after the government announced plans to increase fuel prices and dismantle monthly cash handout to lower-income Iranians.  The protests spread to more than 80 cities and rural towns, staged by thousands of young and working class Iranians angry about official corruption, unemployment and a deepening gap between rich and poor.  The authorities have produced no evidence to support assertions of U.S. involvement in the protests, which lacked a unifying leader.  Residents contacted by Reuters in various cities said the protests had shown sign of abating since Thursday, after the establishment intensified a crackdown on the protesters by dispatching Revolutionary Guards forces to several provinces.  Iran\u2019s elite Guards and its affiliated Basij militia suppressed the country\u2019s 2009 unrest over alleged election fraud, in which dozens of pro-reform Iranians were killed.  Iranian officials said the protests were the result of foreign instigation and mocked U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s support of protesters against what he called a \u201cbrutal and corrupt\u201d establishment.  On Friday rallies, protesters chanted \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d, carrying pictures of Iran\u2019s top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and waved Iranian flags.  Television footage of rallies in several cities showed people chanting \u201cWe support Imam Khamenei ... We will not leave him alone in his fight against enemies\u201d.  \u201cDemonstrators demand the punishment of those behind foreign-linked riots which insulted religion and our authorities,\u201d state television reported, referring to the anti-government protests in which social media footage showed protesters tearing down pictures of Khamenei.  Khatami also called on the government to \u201cpay more attention to people\u2019s economic problems.\u201d  To allay tension, the government has suspended its plans to cut cash handouts and increase fuel prices.  \u201cThere are workers who say they have not received their salaries for months ... These problems should be resolved,\u201d Khatami said, according to state TV.  Fearing that further unrest could undermine the Islamic republic altogether, Iran\u2019s faction-ridden political elite has displayed a united front.  But Khamenei and his hardline allies have criticised Rouhani for failing to revive the economy after most sanctions on Iran were lifted in 2016 under a nuclear deal reached between Tehran and major powers aimed at curbing the country\u2019s nuclear programme.  Rouhani secured the deal in 2015, raising hopes of better economic times among many Iranians, but discontent has since risen over the lack of broad improvement in living standards.

Investors are awaiting the December U.S. payrolls numbers later on Friday. The data is expected to show employers maintained a brisk pace of hiring in December while increasing wages for workers.  The report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT), could support Thursday\u2019s data that showed private employers added a stronger-than-expected 250,000 jobs in December.  At 6:55 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 84 points, or 0.34 percent, with 15,398 contracts changing hands.  S&P 500 e-minis were up 8 points, or 0.29 percent, with 84,818 contracts traded.  Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.37 percent, on volume of 18,710 contracts.  The blue-chip Dow industrials closed above 25,000 for the first time on Thursday, its quickest 5,000-point climb since the index was created in 1896, and also at a time when volatility is at historically low levels.  St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Thursday the U.S. tax overhaul is already pushing up equity prices and is likely to boost growth and investment, but should not force the central bank to raise interest rates any faster than expected.  The Fed expects to hike rates thrice in 2018, but it is doubtful that investors have priced in as many.  Philadelphia Fed Chief Patrick Harker and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are expected to speak later in the day.  Data on factory orders and international trade deficit for November as well as non-manufacturing PMI for December are also scheduled to be released on Friday.  Among stocks, Francesca\u2019s Holdings tanked 15 percent premarket after the women\u2019s apparel and accessories maker said it expected up to 17 percent decline in current-quarter same-store sales.  Schlumberger fell 0.8 percent and Chevron 0.5 percent tracking oil prices, which fell from highs last seen in 2015 on soaring U.S. production.

Libya\u2019s budget deficit for 2017 stood at 10.6 billion Libyan dinars ($7.85 billion), down from 20.3 billion dinars the previous year, the bank said in statement published late on Thursday. Oil revenues had totalled $4.8 billion in 2016.  Its oil earnings accounted for more than 86 percent of Libya\u2019s total national revenues of 22.31 billion dinars.  Of 32.7 billion dinars worth of state spending, 20.3 billion dinars went on state salaries and 6 billion dinars on subsidies, the statement said.  The figures show the partial recovery last year in oil production slightly slowing the otherwise rapid economic decline of a nation still dogged by armed conflict and political upheaval more than seven years after the overthrow of veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi.  Economists say the central bank\u2019s figures are unlikely to reflect a complete picture, because the institution has been split for several years between its Tripoli headquarters and a rival branch loyal to a government based in eastern Libya.  Libya has been divided since 2014 between rival institutions and warring factions based in the east and west.  However, the central bank in Tripoli has continued to control oil revenues, which account for nearly all the country\u2019s income, and to disburse them across the country.  Oil production, in decline from 2013, recovered to around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) last year, but this is still well below the more than 1.6 million bpd Libya was pumping before the 2011 uprising.  Living standards have dropped sharply, with inflation running at around 30 percent and the dinar slipping on the black market to around 9 dinars to the dollar.  Foreign reserves have fallen to an estimated $67.5 billion, compared to $123.5 billion in 2012, according to the World Bank.  The central bank said in November it had agreed on currency and spending reforms with the internationally recognised government in Tripoli, but it is unclear when the plan will be carried out.

          "body": "* World stocks hit fresh highs  * Investors prepare for U.S. employment data  * Dollar stuck near four month low vs euro  * Oil slips from recent highs  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Tommy Wilkes  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - World stocks scaled fresh record highs on Friday, while the dollar stuck near four-month lows before crucial payroll numbers that could underpin growing confidence in the world\u2019s biggest economy.  Global equity markets have begun 2018 with their best week in more than a year, continuing last year\u2019s rally that has seen volatility plunge and investors\u2019 appetite for risk surge.  Data on Friday showing euro zone inflation slowing in December will also help bulls stay convinced central banks are not going to tighten monetary policy faster than expected.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.19 percent, above 524 points and at a record high.  The Swiss benchmark rose to an all-time high, and the British index moved to another record, supported by optimism over regional economic strength and gains in U.S. stocks overnight.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.4 percent, holding at a two-month high. The first trading week of 2018 looks set to be the best for Euro zone stocks since May, as shares shrug off a stronger single currency.  \u201cThere is little impediment for continued gains whilst economic conditions that we\u2019ve seen over the last few months continue, and there\u2019s every reason to expect that to continue to be the case,\u201d Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.  Emerging market stocks have had their best start to the year since 2006 and added to those gains on Friday.  The U.S. dollar failed to draw much strength from better-than-expected private payrolls data on Thursday and manufacturing numbers earlier this week, leaving the greenback around a four-month low against the euro.  Euro zone prices grew by 1.4 percent in December on a year earlier, a slower rate than in the previous month. That provides support for the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to keep policy easy despite growing pressure from richer euro zone countries.  Still, with two U.S. interest rate hikes already baked into market expectations, traders believe there is more upside room for the euro as the ECB may move to rein in its monetary largesse faster than the market anticipates.  Investors will also be looking closely at the monthly employment report in the U.S., along with average hourly earnings data, due at 1330 GMT.  The data could give some clues to the likely path for when central banks will tighten.  \u201cCurrency markets broadly know what the Fed is going to do this year but the ECB monetary policy may be the surprise package of 2018,\u201d said Richard Falkenhall, senior FX strategist at SEB in Stockholm.  The dollar has weakened as U.S. long-term bond yields have remained low, despite the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates three times last year.  The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood just above 2.46 percent, below its seven-month peak of 2.504 percent touched on Dec. 21.  Those levels are little different from about a year ago, even with market expectations for another three hikes in 2018.  Expectations that inflation will remain low as wage growth has been slower than before the 2007-2008 financial crisis has capped U.S. long-term bond yields.  Elsewhere, oil prices slipped from highs last seen in 2015 after soaring U.S. production undermined a 10-percent rally driven by tightening supplies and political tensions in Iran - from lows hit in December.  Gold prices dipped from the previous session\u2019s 3-1/2 month high but remained on track for their fourth straight weekly gain.  Signs of investor appetite for risk more broadly were evident in Greece, where 10-year borrowing costs hit their lowest in 12 years on Friday.  The country, once on the verge of defaulting on its debts, has benefited from expectations of a clean exit from its bailout this year and a revival in the economy.  \u201cGreece\u2019s fundamentals have been on the mend and investors have been looking at the yield pick-up they get from investing in that debt,\u201d said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.  \u201cAlso, a rising tide lifts all boats - with the euro zone economy doing so well, it\u2019s a very \u2018risk on\u2019 environment and that is benefiting Greece.\u201d  For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in \u2018Live Markets\u2019 in the search bar.

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s plans to legislate against fake news are running into opposition.  Twitter users have propelled \u201cInventYourFakeNews\u201d to a top trending topic, opposition lawmakers warn of a risk to civil liberties and experts say a law might not be the best tool.  Macron\u2019s announcement Wednesday was the latest attempt by a government to find ways to handle the worldwide spread of disinformation on social media \u2014 \u201cfake news\u201d, as U.S. President Donald Trump calls it.  His plan would allow judges to block a website or a user account, in particular during an election, and oblige internet platforms to publish the names of those behind sponsored contents. That raises more questions than answers, critics said.  \u201cOnly authoritarian regimes try to control what the truth is,\u201d said senior conservative senator Bruno Retailleau. Freedom of expression carries risks, but that\u2019s better \u201cthan the temptation to control minds,\u201d he said.  Twitter users in France made up their own fake news with the hashthag #InventeDesFakeNews (or InventYourFakeNews), which ranged from seeing corporate executives donate money to cut France\u2019s debt load to seeing dead singers alive. Meanwhile, Macron\u2019s opponents across the political spectrum slammed the plan.  \u201cIs France still a democracy if it muzzles its citizens? This is very worrying!\u201d National Front leader Marine Le Pen said on Twitter.  Attempts to regulate speech online walk a fine line, which critics says can amount to censorship. A similar law in Germany led authorities to briefly block a satirical magazine\u2019s Twitter account on Wednesday after it parodied anti-Muslim comments.      Major internet platforms Facebook and Google declined to comment directly on Macron\u2019s announcement, instead pointing out initiatives where they attempt to self-regulate or cooperate with local media, including in France, to track fake news.  \u201cAny regulation should be thought through together with the industry,\u201d internet legislation lawyer Christelle Coslin said. She noted that an 1881 law already allows prosecution for the publication of fake information. It would be crucial, she said, to make sure that any ruling by a judge would be technically enforceable.  \u201cThe real question is who can say what is a true or fake information?\u201d, Coslin said.   Macron has a solid majority in parliament and could get a bill approved without support from the opposition.  Concern about fake news arose after accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election in November 2016 and in last year\u2019s French presidential election. Macron\u2019s team complained then that his campaign was targeted by a \u201cmassive and coordinated\u201d hacking operation.  The European Commission has opened a wide-ranging consultation on how to cope with fake news; its results are expected in the coming months.

          "title": "Japanese companies begin to buckle as Abe pressures them to raise wages",
          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Inc is running out of excuses in the face of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s calls for wage rises of 3 percent or more.  The nation is having its best run of economic growth in a decade, stocks prices are the highest in 26 years, and corporate profits are near an all-time high. At the same time, the labor market, which is already the tightest among major economies, is only set to get tighter as the nation\u2019s population both shrivels and ages rapidly.  And as annual negotiations with labor unions start to ramp up, there are signs that some big companies may be bending as Abe pushes for increases of 3 percent or more, though others are still expected to drag their feet.  Last year, the average increase among 312 major companies was 2.11 percent before bonuses, according to labor ministry figures.    Successive years of  tiny, or even zero, wage increases may be coming to an end at some companies at least \u2013 which in turn could provide consumer spending and inflation with a welcome boost this year.   For example, Asahi Group Holdings (2502.T) plans to raise wages by 3 percent at its beer-making operation and by 3.4 percent at its unit that produces soft drinks.   Last year Asahi raised wages at its beer-making unit by 2.9 percent. Data on wage gains at its soft drink unit was not immediately available.   \u201cThis is a result of management\u2019s thoughts about how we should treat our employees,\u201d President Akiyoshi Koji told reporters at a reception for corporate executives to mark the start of the new year. He denied that the move was influenced by the government\u2019s request to raise wages, saying: \u201cAn increase in disposable income helps improve the economy.\u201d  Some other companies are discussing whether to abide by Abe\u2019s call.  \u201cI want to debate this and do as much as possible to make sure disposable incomes rise,\u201d Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) Chief Executive Toshiaki Higashihara told reporters at a new year\u2019s reception on Friday.  \u201cI approve of raising disposable incomes, because in the end this will improve the economy by raising consumption.\u201d   Japan\u2019s Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said on Friday he is confident that the conditions are ripe for increases.    \u201cOur policies have created the environment necessary for companies to use their record-high corporate earnings to raise wages and increase investment,\u201d he told reporters on Friday after a cabinet meeting. \u201cI strongly believe our changes to the tax code will encourage companies to take bold steps to raise wages and capital expenditure.\u201d  Abe\u2019s government plans to introduce legislation to the regular session of parliament later this month that will lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from around 30 percent for companies that raise wages by 3 percent or more. The incentive will appeal to some large companies, but it is unlikely to work with some others who already pay an effective rate below 25 percent. There are also many small companies that have  effective tax rates well below 25 percent.  The legislation, which is almost certain to pass into law, will also cut taxes for companies that invest in cutting-edge technology.  The tax breaks are the latest carrot Abe\u2019s government has dangled in front of Japanese companies to convince them to help with his agenda aimed at reflating the economy.    Since taking office in late 2012, Abe has appealed directly to the largest business lobbies to raise wages at annual negotiations with unions that take place in the spring.    Abe\u2019s overriding goal is to make sure consumers have enough money in their pockets to keep spending - vanquishing the threat of deflation and making it easier to meet the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2 percent inflation target. In November, the core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food, rose only 0.9 percent from the same period a year earlier.      Economists say there are many reasons why companies like Hitachi can afford to raise wages.  As well as strong corporate profits, cash and reserves held by Japanese companies stood at an eye-popping record of 1,207 trillion yen ($10.7 trillion) in the third quarter, according to central bank data.    Meanwhile, Japan\u2019s jobless rate is 2.7 percent, the lowest since November 1993 and by far the lowest among Group of Seven countries.    The shrinking of the working-age population will eventually force companies to raise wages to compete for workers, economists say.    But not all companies share the optimism about wages and many firms will come in below the 3 percent increase the government is looking for, economists say.    This should still be enough to keep consumer spending on track to rise this year, which will make it easier to achieve faster inflation.    \u201cAbe is taking these steps because so far wages have lagged the improvement in the real economy,\u201d said Kentaro Arita, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.    \u201cThe elements needed to raise wages are falling into place, but one thing that is lacking for some companies is confidence about the future. Wage gains will be gradual.\u201d($1 = 112.9500 yen)  (This version of the story refiles to fix grammar in first paragraph.)

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Charles Randell, an ex-lawyer who advised the British government during the financial crisis, has been appointed chair of Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, the finance ministry said on Friday.  Randell, formerly a partner at international law firm Slaughter & May, will face the tricky task of helping Britain\u2019s financial services sector to navigate the country\u2019s departure from the European Union, which could potentially put UK finance jobs at risk.  He also joins the FCA at a time when its remit has expanded to take in thousands of consumer credit firms, forcing it to review its \u201cmission\u201d and warn that it must prioritize its work.  Randell takes over in April from John Griffith-Jones who was appointed for a 5-year term in 2013.   He already has experience as a regulator as an external member of the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC), which oversees its banking supervision arm.  He acted as an adviser to the government during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, including on bank rescues such as Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley.  He advised ministers on investments into Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Lloyds\u2019 (LLOY.L) takeover of HBOS. Randell also advised on Portugal\u2019s recapitalization of its banking sector.  \u201cCharles has a wealth of relevant experience, and I am sure that he will prove to be a strong leader at this very important time,\u201d Britain\u2019s finance minister Philip Hammond said in a statement.  Randell has resigned from the PRC and will leave before taking up his new three-days-a-week job at the FCA, which is responsible for authorizing exchanges, asset managers and consumer credit companies.  BoE Governor Mark Carney said Randell would be \u201csorely missed\u201d at the PRC, but he was pleased he was willing to chair the FCA \u201cat this important juncture\u201d for the watchdog and UK financial services.  The FCA regulates Europe\u2019s most important financial center and one that has heavily influenced how the EU\u2019s market and banking rules have been shaped.  Brexit will mean losing influence over EU financial rulemaking and the watchdog could also face pressure from pro-Brexit lawmakers to ease up on regulation to keep the City of London competitive - a move it has so far resisted.  FCA chief executive, Andrew Bailey, who also came from the BoE where he was deputy governor in charge of banking supervision, welcomed Randell\u2019s appointment.  \u201cHis experience of regulation, both during the financial crisis and more recently as a member of the Prudential Regulation Committee, mean that he has a strong understanding of the challenges that the FCA faces and I look forward to tackling these with him in his new role,\u201d Bailey said in a statement.  Randell is likely to be grilled by parliament\u2019s Treasury Select Committee about his appointment, though he is likely to face a smoother ride than his predecessor.  The FCA\u2019s first chair, Griffith-Jones, was given a rough ride by some lawmakers initially, who said he lacked deep experience in consumer-related conduct issues.  Griffith-Jones also had to recuse himself from a report by the FCA and BoE on the collapse of HBOS during the financial crisis. Griffith-Jones was UK head of accountants KPMG when the firm audited HBOS in the run up to the collapse.  Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Jane Merriman"

          "body": "COLOMBO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares rose on Friday, closing the first week of the new year on a firm note, on the back of heavy foreign buying in blue chips.  The Colombo Stock Index ended 0.85 percent firmer at 6,514.73, its highest close since Nov. 11.  It rose 2.3 percent this week, in its second consecutive weekly rise.  Foreign investors net bought shares worth 357.1 million rupees ($2.33 million) on Friday, extending the net foreign inflow in this year to 1.96 billion rupees.  They had net bought 18.5 billion rupees worth equities in 2017 and 633.5 million rupees in 2016.  Turnover stood at 1.4 billion rupees on Friday, more than last year\u2019s daily average of 915.3 million rupees.  Shares in conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc rose 2.6 percent, Dialog Axiata Plc gained 3.1 percent and Melstacorp Ltd climbed 3.1 percent.  There was continued buying interest with an added interest in blue chips, said Dimantha Mathew, head of research at First Capital Holdings.  \u201cThere is renewed interest from foreign investors which is a good sign,\u201d said Mathew, adding that he expected the positive trend to continue due to declining market interest rates.  Treasury bill rates fell 188 basis points to 216 basis points between March and end-December 2017, mainly driven by foreign investors buying treasury bonds, resulting in declining market interest rates.  The country\u2019s 2018 economic growth trajectory is likely to help boost market sentiment, analysts said.  Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth in 2018 is forecast at 5-5.5 percent, bouncing back from an anticipated four-year low of less than 4 percent last year, central bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said on Wednesday.  The central bank kept its benchmark interest rates unchanged last week, saying inflation and private sector credit growth have cooled to a manageable level as policy makers focus on supporting a slowing economy.

          "title": "Banking crisis adviser named as head of Britain's finance watchdog",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Charles Randell, an ex-lawyer who advised the British government during the financial crisis, has been appointed chair of Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, the finance ministry said on Friday.  Randell, formerly a partner at international law firm Slaughter & May, will face the tricky task of helping Britain\u2019s financial services sector to navigate the country\u2019s departure from the European Union, which could potentially put UK finance jobs at risk.  He also joins the FCA at a time when its remit has expanded to take in thousands of consumer credit firms, forcing it to review its \u201cmission\u201d and warn that it must prioritize its work.  Randell takes over in April from John Griffith-Jones who was appointed for a 5-year term in 2013.   He already has experience as a regulator as an external member of the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC), which oversees its banking supervision arm.  He acted as an adviser to the government during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, including on bank rescues such as Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley.  He advised ministers on investments into Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Lloyds\u2019 (LLOY.L) takeover of HBOS. Randell also advised on Portugal\u2019s recapitalization of its banking sector.  \u201cCharles has a wealth of relevant experience, and I am sure that he will prove to be a strong leader at this very important time,\u201d Britain\u2019s finance minister Philip Hammond said in a statement.  Randell has resigned from the PRC and will leave before taking up his new three-days-a-week job at the FCA, which is responsible for authorizing exchanges, asset managers and consumer credit companies.  BoE Governor Mark Carney said Randell would be \u201csorely missed\u201d at the PRC, but he was pleased he was willing to chair the FCA \u201cat this important juncture\u201d for the watchdog and UK financial services.  The FCA regulates Europe\u2019s most important financial center and one that has heavily influenced how the EU\u2019s market and banking rules have been shaped.  Brexit will mean losing influence over EU financial rulemaking and the watchdog could also face pressure from pro-Brexit lawmakers to ease up on regulation to keep the City of London competitive - a move it has so far resisted.  FCA chief executive, Andrew Bailey, who also came from the BoE where he was deputy governor in charge of banking supervision, welcomed Randell\u2019s appointment.  \u201cHis experience of regulation, both during the financial crisis and more recently as a member of the Prudential Regulation Committee, mean that he has a strong understanding of the challenges that the FCA faces and I look forward to tackling these with him in his new role,\u201d Bailey said in a statement.  Randell is likely to be grilled by parliament\u2019s Treasury Select Committee about his appointment, though he is likely to face a smoother ride than his predecessor.  The FCA\u2019s first chair, Griffith-Jones, was given a rough ride by some lawmakers initially, who said he lacked deep experience in consumer-related conduct issues.  Griffith-Jones also had to recuse himself from a report by the FCA and BoE on the collapse of HBOS during the financial crisis. Griffith-Jones was UK head of accountants KPMG when the firm audited HBOS in the run up to the collapse.  Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Jane Merriman"

          "body": "(Adds background on tax bill, provision by Goldman Sachs)  Jan 5 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley said on Friday it would take a $1.25 billion hit in its fourth-quarter earnings due to a cut in corporate tax rate as part of the U.S. tax code overhaul. The net blow of the bill to the bank will include about a $1.4 billion net discrete tax provision, mainly due to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lowered corporate tax rate, the company said in a filing.  It would be offset by $160 million in other positive effects, Morgan Stanley added.(bit.ly/2m0QVsB)  The sweeping tax code changes enacted in late December cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and were expected to mean short-term pain, but long-term gain for U.S.-based corporations.  Scores of large companies, including big banks such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co, have socked away an estimated $2.8 trillion overseas in recent years.  The one-time tax on those earnings is expected to raise $339 billion in federal revenues over the coming decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), a nonpartisan research arm of the U.S. Congress.  Morgan Stanley\u2019s arch rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc had said on Dec. 29 it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to decrease by about $5 billion due to repatriation tax, the cost of moving money from foreign countries to the U.S., Goldman said in a filing.

Registrations declined to 1.03 million passenger cars from 1.09 million a year earlier, the consulting firm said on Friday.

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of Western European sales slipped 1.9 percent from November levels to 14.29 million cars, according to LMC.  Sales slumped 14.4 percent in Britain and were down 3.2 percent in Italy, 1 percent in Germany and 0.5 percent in France while Spain posted a 6.2 percent gain, LMC said.  \u201cThe selling-day effect meant most markets in the region were down year-on-year, though Spain was notable in bucking this trend,\u201d LMC analyst Jonathon Poskitt said.

In a written ruling, the judges said there was a risk that Junqueras would again commit an offence if he was released as there was no evidence to show he had abandoned \u201cthe path followed so far\u201d.  He is in custody on allegations of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.

The statement comes after the U.N.

Among the measures in the December resolution, the U.N. prohibits nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and limits crude oil supplies to 4 million barrels a year.

          "title": "Unique 'hotline' sets stage for new North and South Korea talks",
          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - The two sides sit within shouting distance, but when North and South Korea this week arranged the first official talks in more than two years, liaison officials spoke using desktop telephone consoles each the size of a small refrigerator.  The inter-Korean Liaison Office at the heart of this new spurt of dialogue between the two sides, sits at the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom, the only spot along the heavily fortified demilitarized zone that divides North and South Korea where troops from both sides stand face to face.  If the telephone operators wanted to, they could step out of their office and talk to their counterparts only 80 meters (260 feet) away in a separate building across the demarcation line.  \u201cLike what happened today (Friday), we mostly exchange what we call a \u2018telephone notice,\u2019 which basically means that a liaison officer calls the other side and reads a document carrying a proposal or official position on the other\u2019s proposal,\u201d said a senior official with South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Unification, which mans the phone and fax lines at the office.   \u201cBut other times, say, if you need to deliver a document with official seals, you would call them to arrange a face-to-face meeting at a certain time on the demarcation line.\u201d  That happened on a regular basis in the past, when relations were better, the official said, and now Seoul is hoping that these new high-level talks, scheduled for January 9, may bring back an era of more cordial relations between the two Koreas.  North Korean officials had effectively not answered the phone at Panmunjom since February 2016. During that time, South Korean officials would sometimes use a bull horn to shout messages across the border.  For the first time in nearly two years, the hotline was used on Wednesday. On the orders of leader Kim Jong Un, a North Korean official called the South in a preliminary step to a formal dialogue.  Officials have released few details of that conversation and several others that have since occurred, although some were decidedly anticlimactic.  After several calls on Wednesday, a North Korean official called to check the line. When the South\u2019s officer asked if the North had anything new to say, the official on the other end of the line said \u201cno\u201d and hung up, according to the Ministry of Unification.  But by Friday, the conversations paid off, officials said, with North Korea officially accepting the South\u2019s invitation for formal, face-to-face talks next week on North Korean participation at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea next month.  The phone line used to arrange the talks dates to the 1970s, with the current phone installed in 2009, the ministry said.  Photos of the phone show a large, wood-panelled console set into a desktop.  The system features a computer screen, disk drives, and USB ports, as well as two telephone handsets, one red and one green.  No other numbers can be called - the phones use a dedicated line between rooms on the two sides.  \u201cThe red phone is for incoming calls from North Korea and South Korea uses the green phone to make outgoing calls to the North,\u201d a unification ministry spokeswoman said. \u201cWe have installed two phones just in case one breaks or something.\u201d  The Unification Ministry employees who man the phones on the South side are experts in diplomatic protocol and have in the past played roles in face-to-face talks as well.  \u201cAt first sight it may seem a very simple job,\u201d the senior ministry official said. \u201cBut actually it\u2019s a very delicate job because they are not only in charge of the Panmunjom line but when inter-Korean meetings are held, they are also dispatched to the venue as a contact point between the two sides.\u201d  While the phone operators are discouraged from making any jokes about official issues during their conversations, they have in the past built a personal relationship with their counterparts during periods of close communication.  \u201cAs they man the position for a long time, they would talk to each other frequently and therefore naturally foster some personal rapport,\u201d the official said.  Less is known about the North Koreans on the other end of the line. A South Korean liaison officer who engaged in some of the recent conversations said he has never seen his counterparts\u2019 office on the other side, and referred further questions to the Unification Ministry.

          "body": "(Reuters) - French dairy firm Lactalis said on Friday it had agreed to buy siggi\u2019s, the U.S.-based maker of Icelandic style skyr yogurts, for an undisclosed price.  Siggi\u2019s with the tagline \u201csimple ingredients, not a lot of sugar,\u201d has tapped into a shift by consumers toward healthier eating. Its yogurts are at least 25 percent less sugary than leading flavored yogurts, according to its website.  Lactalis said the deal \u201cfurther expands our yogurt platform in the U.S. with this unique and fast-growing yogurt brand.\u201d  After moving to New York from Iceland, siggi\u2019s founder Siggi Hilmarsson felt American yogurt was too sweet and artificial for his liking. He felt homesick for skyr, a sweet Icelandic yoghurt/curd concoction.  Based on a recipe sent by his mother, Siggi began making skyr and went on to establish his own company in 2005 to sell it in the United States.   Siggi\u2019s products are available at Whole Foods, Publix, Target (TGT.N), Wegmans and Starbucks (SBUX.O) stores.  Siggi\u2019s will continue to operate from its New York City office and remain a standalone company under the leadership of Hilmarsson, Lactalis said in a statement.  \u201cOur core values of clean ingredient label and less sugar will remain 100 percent unchanged. Consumers everywhere are actively trying to reduce sugar in their diets so our offering has a global relevance,\u201d Hilmarsson said.  Privately held Lactalis is one of the world\u2019s largest dairy companies, reporting annual sales of around 17 billion euros  ($21 billion).  Separately, Swiss milk processor Emmi (EMMN.S) said it had decided to sell its 22 percent stake in siggi\u2019s to Lactalis.

          "body": "(Adds Crawshaw)  Jan 5 (Reuters) - British retailers are giving updates on the key Christmas trading period stretching from \u201cBlack Friday\u201d on Nov. 24 to clearance sales in early January.  Following are highlights:  Reported on Jan.5:  Crawshaw  British meat retailer Crawshaw Group said it saw strong core festive trade, with sales in the week leading up to Christmas crossing 1.8 million pounds ($2.4 million). However, the company warned a softer consumer environment and cost inflation would drag on profitibility at its high-street outlets.  Reported on Jan.4:  Aldi UK  Aldi UK, the British arm of the German discount supermarket chain, said its sales rose over 15 percent in December year-on-year, a record Christmas performance that was driven by strong demand for its premium ranges.  Debenhams Plc  Retailer Debenhams said its British like-for-like sales at constant currency fell 2.6 percent in the 17 weeks to Dec. 30, reflecting a volatile and competitive market in the autumn and a disappointing first week of its post-Christmas sale. It also downgraded its profit forecast after it slashed prices to drive sales in the run-up to Christmas and cut them again after shoppers failed to turn out for its clearance sale.  Reported on Jan.3:  Poundland  Poundland, which is owned by troubled South African group Steinhoff, said it enjoyed a record Christmas, with sales up 5.6 percent in the 12 weeks to Dec. 24.  Next Plc  British clothing retailer Next raised its full-year profit forecast after beating guidance for sales in the run-up to Christmas, as colder weather helped sales of winter clothes. Its shares surged as much as 10 percent.  John Lewis  Department store chain John Lewis reported an 8.9 percent jump in total sales in Christmas week with big increases from fashion, homeware and home technology categories.  $1 = 0.7384 pounds\nCompiled by Rahul B and Radhika Rukmangadhan; Editing by Susan\nFenton and Mark Potter"

          "title": "North Korea agrees to talk to South after U.S.-South Korea postpone drills",
          "body": "SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea agreed on Friday to hold official talks with South Korea next week, the first in more than two years, hours after Washington and Seoul delayed a military exercise amid a standoff over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told U.S. media it was too early to tell if the inter-Korea meeting could open the way for future talks involving the United States, but he stressed that if such talks came about they would have to be aimed at North Korean denuclearization.   South Korea said North Korea had sent its consent for the talks to be held next Tuesday at the border truce village of Panmunjom. The last time the two Koreas engaged in official talks was in December 2015.  The two sides are expected to discuss the Winter Olympics, to be held in South Korea next month, and inter-Korean relations, South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told reporters.  North Korea asked for further negotiations about the meeting to be carried out via documented exchanges, Baik said.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened the way for talks with South Korea in a New Year\u2019s Day speech in which he called for reduced tensions and flagged the North\u2019s possible participation in the Winter Olympics.  But Kim remained steadfast on the issue of nuclear weapons, saying the North would mass-produce nuclear missiles for operational deployment and warned he would launch a nuclear strike if his country was threatened.  U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called the proposed inter-Korean talks a \u201cgood thing,\u201d and he and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in announced that annual large-scale military drills would now take place after the Olympics.  The North sees the drills as preparations for invasion and justification for its weapons programs that it conducts in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.  Trump, who hurled fresh insults at the North Korean leader this week, took credit for any dialogue that takes place.  \u201cDoes anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn\u2019t firm, strong and willing to commit our total \u2018might\u2019 against the North,\u201d Trump tweeted.  Speaking to CNN, Tillerson made clear that Washington was also open to talks with North Korea, but warned that while it aimed to resolve the crisis diplomatically, \u201cthose diplomatic efforts are backed by a strong military option if necessary.\u201d  Tillerson said future talks involving the United States could allow North Korea to \u201cchart a way for themselves to a more secure future, a more prosperous future.\u201d He added: \u201cThey do know how to reach us if and when they are ready to engage with us as well.\u201d  Tillerson said how such talks might begin had yet to be determined, but North Korea would have to signal it understood that they would be aimed at \u201cfinal, full denuclearization.\u201d  He told the Associated Press it remained to be seen whether the North Koreans would want to talk about more than the Olympics next week.  The meeting could be a \u201cvehicle through which they would like to tell us that they would like to have some discussions,\u201d the AP quoted Tillerson as saying.   \u201cIt could be meaningful, it could be important. It could be a meeting about the Olympics and nothing else happens.\u201d   North Korea says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression, and it regularly threatens to destroy the United States and its two key Asia allies, Japan and South Korea.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang welcomed North and South Korea \u201ctaking positive steps to improve ties,\u201d and said the postponement of the exercises was \u201cwithout doubt a good thing.\u201d  China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said it would limit exports of crude oil, refined oil products, steel and other metals to North Korea, in line with tough new sanctions imposed by the United Nations.  Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera sounded a note of caution about the proposed talks.  \u201cI think what is important is to maintain a firm defense posture,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cNorth Korea goes through phases of apparent dialogue and provocation, but either way, North Korea is continuing its nuclear and missile development. We have no intention of weakening our warning and surveillance.\u201d  Earlier this week, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington had heard reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile.  South Korea\u2019s Defence Ministry has said it had yet to see any evidence of an imminent missile launch.  Analysts with the website 38 North, which tracks North Korea, reported Pyongyang may be preparing to test a rocket engine at a facility in Sohae, North Pyongan province, where all of the North\u2019s satellite launches have taken place since 2012.  Commercial satellite imagery from Dec. 25 showed a rail-mounted environment shelter had been moved away from a test stand, indicating that an engine test may be in the near future, the website said, rather than a new rocket launch suspected in recent media reports.

On Tuesday, the Chinese government said it would continue to adhere to the recent U.N. sanctions.  In November, China, one of North Korea\u2019s top trading partners, exported no oil products to the isolated country, apparently going above and beyond the U.N. restrictions.  Among the measures in the December resolution, the U.N. prohibits nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and limits crude oil supplies to 4 million barrels a year.

          "title": "UK productivity growth hits six-year high after weakest decade since 1820s",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s economic productivity perked up in the three months to the end of September, growing at its fastest rate in more than six years, in contrast to its historically weak performance over the previous decade.  Productivity in Britain has stagnated since the global financial crisis even more than in most other advanced economies, and has played a key role in squeezing Britons\u2019 living standards.  Over the past 10 years productivity growth was the weakest since modern records began and appears to be the slowest since the early 1820s, when Britain was emerging from the Napoleonic wars, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday.      During the third quarter of 2017, output per hour worked grew by 0.9 percent compared with the three months before, its first rise since late 2016 and the biggest increase since the second quarter of 2011, the ONS said.  However, the upturn reflected a fall in the number of people in work over the period rather than strong economic growth, which was a lackluster 0.4 percent.  Britain\u2019s economy slowed last year, despite strong global growth, as the plunge in the pound that followed its 2016 vote to leave the European Union triggered higher inflation that hurt consumer spending.  The uncertainty generated by Brexit has also weighed on businesses\u2019 willingness to invest.  Productivity dropped in the first half of 2017 as businesses hired staff faster than they increased output. Compared with a year before, third-quarter productivity was just 0.8 percent higher, less than half its pre-crisis growth rate.  Late last year Britain\u2019s government forecasters revised down their long-run productivity forecasts to around 1 percent a year, after previous expectations for it to pick up to nearer 2 percent were repeatedly disappointed.  A weaker productivity outlook also drove the BoE\u2019s decision in November to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, as it judged the economy would struggle to grow much faster than 1.5 percent a year without creating excessive inflation.  That said, Friday\u2019s data showed unit labor costs - a measure of how much it costs to produce a given amount of output, and a key driver of inflation - rose by the least since the second quarter of 2015, increasing 1.3 percent.  Howard Archer, an economist at forecasters EY ITEM Club, said productivity was likely to have recovered further in the final three months of 2017. Early indications suggest growth remained solid while the number of people in work fell.  But he was less positive about the longer term.  \u201cA major risk is that prolonged uncertainty and concerns over the UK\u2019s economic outlook ends up weighing down markedly on business investment and damages productivity,\u201d he said.  Britain\u2019s government has launched repeated efforts to boost productivity, and says past weakness is partly due to strong job creation, which has pushed unemployment to its lowest in more than 40 years.  ONS data also show a drag from the declining North Sea oil and gas sector, and from heavy losses in financial services after the global crisis. Low investment and inconsistent management quality also weigh on productivity, economists say.  Graphic by Andy Bruce; Editing by Gareth Jones"

          "title": "RPT-After attacks by Trump, Bannon finds himself with few friends",
          "body": "(Repeats with no change in text)  By James Oliphant and Jeff Mason  WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Following his brutal disavowal by President Donald Trump, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s dream of spearheading a new U.S. political movement appears in tatters while the Republican establishment he challenged is feeling more secure.  Trump turned on Bannon over his comments to the author of a book highly critical of the president and his family. The White House followed up on Thursday by suggesting that Bannon be ousted from his influential perch as chief executive of the hard-right news site Breitbart News.  Bannon appeared to have few close friends left among the more conservative factions of the Republican Party, which swiftly proclaimed their loyalty to Trump following the breakup.  \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone in the conservative movement that\u2019s supporting Steve over Donald Trump right now in this,\u201d Christopher Ruddy, a close Trump ally and chief executive of the conservative Newsmax site, told Reuters.  Mike Cernovich, a leading social-media voice of the so-called alt-right movement that Bannon helped energize on Trump\u2019s behalf, had no doubt about which of the two men had more popular support. \u201cThe base will stay with Trump.\u201d  Reader comments on Breitbart\u2019s site seemed overwhelmingly supportive of the president compared with Bannon. The Wall Street Journal reported late on Thursday that the site\u2019s board was considering letting him go.  Bannon\u2019s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.  Last year, media outlets as diverse as Time magazine and the comedy show \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d portrayed Bannon, Trump\u2019s election campaign strategist, as the power behind the president, an unshaven, shabbily dressed Svengali bending the Republican Party to his economic nationalist agenda.  But Bannon\u2019s star had been tumbling long before this week\u2019s flap over criticism Bannon leveled at Trump\u2019s family in Michael Wolff\u2019s new book on the White House.  In August, Bannon was fired amid a power struggle in the West Wing, forcing his return to Breitbart.  His reputation as a political mastermind then took a hit after Republicans lost a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama they had long held when the Bannon-backed Roy Moore, who was accused of improper conduct with teenage girls, fell to Democrat Doug Jones.  After leaving the White House, Bannon proclaimed his loyalty to Trump and vowed to wage an insurrection against the Republican establishment, especially Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom he accused of stalling Trump\u2019s policy agenda.  But last month, on the heels of Moore\u2019s loss in Alabama, McConnell helped steer an overhaul of the U.S. tax code through Congress, earning praise from Trump and depriving Bannon of his argument that the Republican-controlled Congress had not produced results.  Trump turned on Bannon on Wednesday, saying he had \u201clost his mind\u201d when he lost his job as chief strategist. He said Bannon did not represent Trump\u2019s political base and had exaggerated his influence even when he was at the White House.  Following Trump\u2019s attack, some of the candidates who had aligned themselves with Bannon\u2019s movement began stepping away, including Arizona U.S. Senate hopeful Kelli Ward and New York congressional candidate Michael Grimm, who called the attacks against Trump\u2019s family \u201cbaseless.\u201d  Bannon\u2019s influence, Ruddy said, had always stemmed from the belief that he was close to Trump.  \u201cHe\u2019s greatly diminished,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Steve forgets is the base is all about Donald Trump. It\u2019s not about Steve Bannon.\u201d  Josh Holmes, a former top aide to McConnell, said Bannon had been on a \u201cself-interested mission\u201d to play kingmaker inside the Republican Party.  \u201cI think that\u2019s over. ... A leader without followers is just a guy taking a walk,\u201d Holmes said.  A friend of Bannon, former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg, said he doubted Bannon\u2019s relationship with Trump could be fully repaired. But he added that Bannon would retain some sway over Trump\u2019s supporters, particularly on issues such as immigration.  \u201cThis is not the end of the world, particularly with this president,\u201d Nunberg said.  Trump is known for casting associates out of the fold, but also for bringing them back, particularly if there are common political interests or common enemies.  The president did appear to be in a slightly forgiving mood on Thursday, noting that Bannon had praised him the night before on a radio show.  \u201cI don\u2019t know, he called me a great man last night,\u201d Trump told reporters, \u201cso you know, he obviously changed his tune pretty quick.\u201d  Reporting by James Oliphant and Jeff Mason; Additional\nreporting by John Whitesides; Written by James Oliphant; Editing\nby Kieran Murray and Peter Cooney"

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc will release a patch for the Safari web browser on its iPhones, iPads and Macs within days, it said on Thursday, after major chipmakers disclosed flaws that leave nearly every modern computing device vulnerable to hackers.  Browser makers Google, Microsoft Corp and Mozilla Corp\u2019s Firefox all confirmed to Reuters that the patches they currently have in place do not protect iOS users. With Safari and virtually all other popular browsers not patched, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users may have no secure means of browsing the web until Apple issues its patch.  Apple stressed that there were no known instances of hackers taking advantage of the flaw to date.  On Wednesday, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and other security researchers disclosed two major chip flaws, one called Meltdown affecting only Intel Corp chips and one called Spectre affecting nearly all computer chips made in the last decade. The news sparked a sell-off in Intel\u2019s stock as investors tried to gauge the costs to the chipmaker.  In a statement on its website, Apple said all Mac and iOS devices were affected by both Meltdown and Spectre. But the most recent operating system updates for Mac computers, Apple TVs, iPhones and iPads protect users against the Meltdown attack and do not slow down the devices, it added, and Meltdown does not affect the Apple Watch.  Macs and iOS devices are vulnerable to Spectre attacks through code that can run in web browsers. Apple said it would issue a patch to its Safari web browser for those devices \u201cin the coming days.\u201d  Shortly after the researchers disclosed the chip flaws on Wednesday, Google and Microsoft released statements telling users which of their products were affected. Google said its users of Android phones - more than 80 percent of the global market - were protected if they had the latest security updates.      Apple remained silent for more than a day about the fate of the hundreds of millions of users of its iPhones and iPads. Ben Johnson, co-founder and chief strategist for cyber security firm Carbon Black, said the delay in updating customers about whether Apple\u2019s devices are at risk could affect Apple\u2019s drive to get more business customers to adopt its hardware.      \u201cSomething this severe gets the attention of all the employees and executives at a company, and when they go asking the IT and security people about it and security doesn\u2019t have an answer for iPhones and iPads, it just doesn\u2019t give a whole lot of confidence,\u201d Johnson said.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) said fixes for security issues in its microchips would not slow down computers, rebuffing concerns that the flaws found in microprocessors would significantly reduce performance.  The performance impact of the recent security updates should not be significant and will be mitigated over time, Intel said late on Thursday, adding that Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported little to no performance impact from the security updates. intel.ly/2CHQ89E  Intel shares fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday as investors were worried about the potential financial liability and reputational damage from the recently disclosed security issues.  The largest chipmaker confirmed earlier this week that the security issues reported by researchers in the company\u2019s widely used microprocessors could allow hackers to steal sensitive information from computers, phones and other devices.   Security researchers had disclosed two security flaws exposing vulnerability of nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and ARM Holdings.  The first, called Meltdown, affects Intel chips and lets hackers bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer\u2019s memory, potentially letting hackers read a computer\u2019s memory and steal passwords. The second, called Spectre, affects chips from Intel, AMD and ARM and lets hackers potentially trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information.  Intel had said the issues were not caused by a design flaw and asked users to download a patch and update their operating system.  Intel may be on the hook for costs stemming from lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers will likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make, security experts said.

The price was just over half that of last year\u2019s winning bid of 72 million yen and well below the record 155 million yen paid in 2013.   \u201cI\u2019ve tried to win in the auction since last year, so I\u2019m really happy,\u201d said Onodera, whose company has restaurants in New York and Singapore as well as in Japan. \u201cThis is especially true because it\u2019s the last year in Tsukiji.\u201d  Tuna is prized around the world for its use in sushi, but experts warn growing demand has made it an endangered species.  \u201cThe high price paid today for a single Pacific bluefin tuna should not distract from the dire status of the species, which has been depleted by more than 97 percent by years of overfishing,\u201d said Jamie Gibbon, a Pacific bluefin tuna expert for the Pew Charitable Trusts, in a statement.  \u201cIf countries continue to exceed their catch limits...the very survival of the species will be threatened.\u201d  The 80-year-old Tsukiji market draws tens of thousands of visitors a year to its warren of stalls with exotic species of fish and fresh sushi, part of a tourism boom that is a key part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic revival plan.   \u201cThis will truly be the final auction here, so I made sure I came to watch,\u201d said Mitsuko Yamaguchi, the 61-year-old owner of a seafood store.

The spot rupee which traded at 153.40/50 per dollar during the day, ended at 153.55/65, compared with Thursday\u2019s close of 153.60/70.  The currency fell 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016.  \u201cThere were remittances and exporter conversions in the morning.

Pressure on the currency from imports is expected to prevail until the central bank sorts out new regulations for derivatives, which has slowed forward trading in the currency, dealers said.  The central bank, while announcing its key economic policies for the year, said it has allowed for more flexibility in determining the exchange rate based on market conditions.  It has intervened only to smoothen rupee volatility and to build up reserves, the banking regulator said. (Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)"

          "body": "* Tech companies say security patches not slowing processors  * CERT researchers back down on need for mass chip replacement  * Intel shares sank on Tues/Wed on fears of exposure  By Kanishka Singh and Douglas Busvine  FRANKFURT/BENGALURU, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Security issues with Intel Corp microchips are only slowing computers slightly, technology companies said, as researchers played down the need for mass hardware replacements to protect millions of devices from hackers.  Google and other security researchers this week disclosed two major chip flaws - one called Meltdown affecting only Intel Corp chips and one called Spectre affecting nearly all computer chips made in the last decade.  That raised the prospect of Intel being on the hook for lawsuits claiming that software patches to fix the issue would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, driving the company\u2019s shares down.  But Intel said in a statement after U.S. stock markets closed on Thursday that the performance impact of the recent security updates should not be significant and would be mitigated over time.  It said Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Google and Microsoft Corp had all reported little to no performance impact from security patches. intel.ly/2CHQ89E  \u201cIntel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent and, for the average computer user, should not be significant,\u201d it said.  The company confirmed that the flaws reported by the researchers could allow hackers to steal information from computers, phones and other devices, but insisted that the issue was not a design flaw.  The chipmaker said it would require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix the issue.  Microsoft and Google have said they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers.  Apple said in a separate statement late on Thursday that its tests showed patches would not significantly affect processing speeds.  \u201cOur testing with public benchmarks has shown that the changes in the December 2017 updates resulted in no measurable reduction in the performance of macOS and iOS ... or in common Web browsing benchmarks,\u201d the California-based firm said.  CERT, the cyber security project at Carnegie Mellon University sponsored by the U.S. government, on Friday withdrew its recommendation for the replacement of the central processing units (CPUs) of affected systems.  In the updated guidance, CERT said \u201coperating system and some application updates mitigate these attacks\u201d.  Daniel Gruss, the 31-year-old information security researcher and post-doctoral fellow at Austria\u2019s Graz Technical University who discovered the Meltdown flaw, welcomed Intel\u2019s white paper on the issue.  \u201cThis looks much more professional now,\u201d Gruss said in comments emailed to Reuters.  On the change in recommendation from CERT, Gruss said, however, that there were no replacements yet that could address the flaws in processors that he and other researchers have found.  \u201cAll CPUs are affected, also very recent ones,\u201d Gruss said. \u201cFurthermore, software updates can fix most of the problems, leaving only a small remaining attack surface.\u201d  Browser makers Google, Microsoft Corp and Mozilla Corp\u2019s Firefox confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that the patches they currently have in place do not protect iOS users.  With Safari and virtually all other popular browsers not patched, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users may not have secure means of web browsing until Apple issues its patch.  Apple said it would release a patch for the Safari web browser on its devices within days. It said that there were no known instances of hackers taking advantage of the flaw to date.

          "body": "BARCELONA (Reuters) - Lionel Messi could leave Barcelona without a transfer fee if Catalonia ceded from Spain and the club did not compete in any of Europe\u2019s top four leagues, El Mundo said on Friday, citing a clause in his new contract.  Barca\u2019s all-time top scorer signed the contract in November, seven months before his old deal expired. It runs until June 2021 and contains a 700 million euro ($843 million) buy-out clause.  But according to the Spanish daily, it would also allow the five-times world player of the year to leave the club where he has spent his entire career for free if Catalonia\u2019s independence push resulted in Barca exiting Spain\u2019s top flight and not joining either the Premier League, the Bundesliga or Serie A.  A Barca spokesman declined to comment directly on the report but added: \u201cIn the interests of confidentiality the club never comment on contracts signed with players and never will.\u201d  Messi\u2019s management team could not immediately be reached for comment.  The political crisis triggered by Catalonia\u2019s independence drive remains unresolved after separatists won a slim parliamentary majority in a regional election last month.  Argentinian Messi\u2019s latest contract was signed on Nov. 25, before that vote but after an autumn referendum on independence that authorities in Madrid declared illegal, dissolving the region\u2019s political institutions after they ratified it.  The referendum had direct ramifications for Barcelona who, on the day that it was held, chose to play their La Liga game against Las Palmas behind closed doors in response to police violence against would-be voters.   The president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, has repeatedly said Barcelona would be booted out of the Spanish league along with  all other Catalan clubs in the event of independence, as only teams from Spain and Andorra are legally entitled to compete in the Spanish leagues.  Barca, who have won 24 Liga titles and lead this season\u2019s standings by nine points, said after the referendum they would not speculate on the future.  However, they were \u201cnot planning for any other scenario than playing in the Spanish league. The club is competing in this competition and wants to win it.\u201d  Reporting by Richard Martin; editing by John Stonestreet"

Siniakova fired 27 winners and 10 aces to prevail 6-2 3-6 6-3 but was made to work hard for the win after Russian Sharapova rediscovered her rhythm midway through the contest.  After losing the first set, Sharapova attacked Siniakova\u2019s serve to seal an early break in the second set.  The five-times grand slam champion gave little away after that and leveled the contest at one set apiece.  A stinging backhand down the line gave Siniakova a decisive break in the final set and the sixth seed hung on to close out the match in just under two hours.  Halep beat fellow Romanian Irina-Camelia Begu 6-1 6-4 in one hour 29 minutes to claim a second career final spot at Shenzhen.  The top seed broke Begu early in the contest to race into a 4-1 lead. Begu sent a forehand wide in a see-sawing sixth game as Halep broke again and took the first set on serve.  Fourth seed Begu, seeking a first win over Halep at her sixth attempt, fought back to lead 3-2 in the second set but Halep eventually subdued the comeback attempt to seal victory.  \u201cIt was a tough match,\u201d Halep said in a courtside interview. \u201cI know she is a strong player and in the second set you could see she was improving her game so it was a tougher battle.  \u201cI think I was strong enough to stay there and hit the ball stronger in the end because the energy (from Begu) was falling a little bit.

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran\u2019s army chief declared on Thursday that police had quelled anti-government unrest that has killed 21 people but that his troops were ready to intervene if needed, as authorities staged more pro-government rallies.  The protests, which seem spontaneous and without a unifying leader, erupted a week ago in Iran\u2019s second city of Mashhad over economic hardships - mostly high youth unemployment, high living costs and alleged corruption.  (For a map of protests in Iran, click tmsnrt.rs/2CGK4eQ)   \u201cAlthough this blind sedition was so small that a portion of the police force was able to nip it in the bud ... you can rest assured that your comrades in the Islamic Republic\u2019s army would be ready to confront the dupes of the Great Satan (United States),\u201d Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi was quoted in official media as saying.  Iran\u2019s vastness as well as restrictions on independent media make it hard to determine the breadth and depth of the unrest.  The semi-official labor news agency ILNA said the government on Thursday lifted restrictions on Instagram, one of the social media tools used to mobilize protesters. But access to a more widely used messaging app, Telegram, remained blocked, suggesting authorities remained uneasy about protest threats.  In the latest protests, which generally occur after nightfall, social media video showed demonstrators in Khorramabad in southwestern Iran on Wednesday evening throwing stones at riot police, who were retreating.  In other social media footage, hundreds poured into streets of the northwestern city of Orumiyeh near the Turkish border, chanting anti-government slogans.  None of the videos could be authenticated by Reuters.  The student news agency ISNA quoted Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli as saying on Thursday that \u201cat most 42,000 people attended the protests, which is not much\u201d in a nation of 80 million people.  On Wednesday, the commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said the number of \u201ctroublemakers\u201d did not exceed 15,000 nationwide.  Amnesty International said on Thursday that more than a thousand Iranians had been arrested and detained in jails \u201cnotorious for torture and other ill-treatment over the past seven days\u201d, with many being denied access to families and lawyers.  Iranian Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi, in an interview with Reuters, urged the United States and the international community to support protests in Iran with political sanctions and not economic measures that could hit the general population.  She called for a ban on \u201csales of arms or any tools that can be used to suppress people,\u201d and restriction on Iran\u2019s dozens of radio and television stations, that she said were part of a \u201cwrongful\u201d foreign policy, and \u201cspread hatred and lies\u201d in different languages.  A senior U.S. official said on Wednesday that the United States aimed to collect \u201cactionable information\u201d that could allow it to pursue sanctions against Iranian individuals and organizations involved in a crackdown on protesters.  U.S. President Donald Trump - who has criticized Iran for its ballistic missile program and human rights record - said on Wednesday he would throw support behind Iranian protesters at an \u201cappropriate time\u201d.   The United States on Thursday sanctioned five Iranian-based entities it said were owned or controlled by a industrial firm responsible for developing and producing Iran\u2019s solid-propellant ballistic missiles.  Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said earlier this week Washington was seeking emergency sessions on Iran\u2019s turmoil at the U.N. Security Council in New York and the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.  Russia rejected the idea, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov calling it \u201charmful and destructive\u201d, according to RIA news agency.  He said Iran\u2019s domestic affairs had nothing to do with the U.N. Security Council\u2019s role, which was the \u201cmaintenance of international peace and security\u201d.  RARE ANTI-GOVERNMENT OUTBURSTS  As unrest spread across Iran, mainly in smaller cities and towns, protesters said they were tired of official anti-Western rhetoric and it was time for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the government of President Hassan Rouhani to quit.  \u201cI voted for Khatami and Rouhani, hoping for change. Hoping for freedom. Hoping to live like a normal human being. But nothing has changed,\u201d said Maryam Azemi, 48, a mother of two in the city of Karaj near Tehran.  \u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone anymore. We waited so long for change in this country. We tried peaceful ways to bring change, like voting, but look at us now. The officials are competing with each other to rip us off.\u201d  Protests have drawn largely young people and workers but have begun to draw in members of the educated middle class that formed the backbone of a pro-reform revolt almost a decade ago.  After six days of demonstrations, Jafari said on Wednesday that Revolutionary Guards units had been deployed to put down protests in three provinces that have been hotbeds of unrest. That was the clearest sign yet that authorities were taking the protests seriously.  The Revolutionary Guards, the sword and shield of Iran\u2019s Shi\u2019ite theocracy, were instrumental in suppressing an uprising over alleged election fraud in 2009 in which dozens were killed.   STATE-SPONSORED COUNTER-DEMONSTRATIONS  State television broadcast live pictures of pro-government rallies on Thursday, including Ghaemshahr in northern Iran and Mashhad in the northeast, and Shahin Shahr in central Iran. Marchers carried posters saying, \u201cNo to riots\u201d, and \u201cDeath to seditionists\u201d, as well as portraits of Khamenei.  State media said three Iranian security agents were killed on Wednesday near the Iraqi border in a clash that led to the dismantling of a team of \u201ccounter-revolutionaries\u201d who had planned to cause explosions and provoke unrest.   The intelligence ministry said several \u201cterrorists\u201d were killed in the clash and one was arrested. Kurdish rebels are known to be active in the area.  Few believe the protests pose an existential threat to the clerical elite, backed by pervasive security services, that have dominated Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew a U.S.-backed monarchy.         But protesters have become increasingly bold in challenging Khamenei, who blamed the most sustained challenge to his 29 years in power for nearly a decade on \u201cseditionists\u201d and foreign agents.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to harm my country but when I see those who run this country are so corrupt, I feel like I am being suffocated. They just talk. They accuse \u2018the enemies\u2019 of everything,\u201d said protester Reza, 43, a father of three in the central city of Isfahan.    \u201cI am not an enemy. I am an Iranian. I love my country. Stop stealing my money, my children\u2019s money,\u201d he told Reuters by telephone.

Utility companies across the East worked to repair downed power lines early on Friday as about 21,000 customers remained without electricity, down from almost 80,000 the day before, and issued warnings that temperatures may become dangerously low.  \u201cIf the temperature in your home begins to fall, we recommend taking shelter elsewhere until service can be restored. You can find warming centers by contacting local authorities,\u201d National Grid power company, which serves Massachusetts, said on Twitter.  The storm, packing winds gusts of more than 70 miles per hour (113 kph), dumped a foot or more of snow throughout the region, including Boston and parts New Jersey and Maine, where heavy snow continued to fall early on Friday.  Many East Coast communities ordered drivers to stay off the roads and closed schools on Friday. Schools in Boston and Baltimore canceled classes while Newark, New Jersey schools were opening two hours later than usual on Friday.  The storm on Thursday caused a 3-foot (0.9-metre) tidal surge which flooded the area around Boston\u2019s historic Long Wharf with icy seawater. Firefighters used an inflatable raft to rescue one motorist from a car submerged in water up to its door handles, Boston Fire Commissioner Joseph Finn told reporters.  The storm forced thousands of flights to be canceled and New York City\u2019s two main airports halted flights because of whiteout conditions.  \u201cFliers are urged to contact their airlines for information on resumption of specific flights before going to the airport,\u201d said JFK on Twitter as the airport announced that flights would resume at 7 a.m. Friday.  Passenger train operator Amtrak said it reduced service on several routes in the Northeast on Friday, including its train between Washington D.C. and Boston. Transit systems including New York\u2019s Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines reduced service and told passengers to expect delays on Friday.  The storm was powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d It brought high winds and swift, heavy snowfall.  The wintry weather has been blamed for at least 14 deaths in the past few days, including three in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas because of the cold.  Nearly 500 members of the National Guard were activated along the East Coast to assist with emergency response, including 200 in New York state, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement.  Officials reported traffic accidents throughout the Northeast and the storm\u2019s reach extended to eastern Canada.  On Wednesday, the same storm brought historic cities in the Southeastern United States their heaviest snowfall in three decades.

          "body": "* Export tax to be suspended for 3 months from Jan. 8  * Suspension to be lifted sooner if stocks drop to 1.6 mln t  * Stronger ringgit, competitive rival soyoil could negate tax suspension - Trader (Updates with comments from trader, election background)  By Emily Chow  KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Malaysia could see rising demand for palm oil from key overseas buyers in the coming weeks following its decision to suspend export taxes on crude palm oil for three months from Monday.  The government announced the tax suspension on Friday and traders said the move will make Malaysian palm oil more competitive, especially in price sensitive markets such as India and China.  \u201cWe are going to see buying coming in from China ahead of the Lunar New Year. India will also restock in the first and second quarter of the year as they have low stock levels,\u201d said a Kuala Lumpur-based trader, who estimates that Malaysian palm oil exports could pick up 10-15 percent on a monthly basis.  Malaysia usually calculates a reference price each month to determine the crude palm oil export duty rate, whereby a price above 2,250 ringgit ($563) incurs a tax.  Its last calculated reference price for January was 2,623.31 ringgit per tonne, effectively incurring a 5.5 percent tax rate.  The minister of plantation industries and commodities Mah Siew Keong told a press conference on Friday the tax suspension was aimed at boosting palm oil prices and reducing high stockpiles, adding that he expected stocks to continue to increase in 2018.  The suspension, which is open to all companies with crude palm oil export licenses, will be scrapped before the end of the three-month period if crude palm oil stocks fall to 1.6 million tonnes.  \u201c(The scheme) is one of the short-term pre-emptive measures by the government to manage the fall in crude palm oil prices, so that the smallholders\u2019 (small-scale farmers) incomes are not impacted and the country\u2019s oil palm industry continues to be competitive,\u201d Mah said.  Palm oil inventories in Malaysia, the second-biggest producer after Indonesia, had already risen to near two-year highs by the end of November, squeezing benchmark prices to a 16-month low in mid-December.  Official data showed stocks grew 16 percent in November, from October, to 2.56 million tonnes due to weak exports. Inventories are seen rising further to 2.69 million tonnes at the end of December - the highest in over two years - according to a Reuters poll.  The price of palm oil tumbled nearly 20 percent in 2017, and was up 0.35 percent at 2,594 ringgit ($649.31) at the close of trade on Friday.  The trader, however, cautioned that the impact of the tax suspension could be muted by gains in the ringgit, which advanced to 3.9950 per U.S. dollar on Friday, breaking the psychologically significant 4 level.  A stronger ringgit, palm oil\u2019s traded currency, usually makes the vegetable oil more expensive for foreign buyers.  \u201cThe recent strengthening of the ringgit may negate some of the effects, as well as the narrowing gap between palm and soyoil,\u201d he said, adding that Malaysia\u2019s upcoming general elections could be one reason for the export tax suspension.  \u201cThe overall trend is that stocks are high, and we haven\u2019t seen production declining at a higher magnitude yet. But the announcement is very timely, especially with the window for elections in the coming months.\u201d  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is seeking to win a third term in an election that must be held by August.  $1 = 3.9950 ringgit\nReporting by Emily Chow; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Susan\nFenton"

Retail sales have grown strongly in Ireland in recent years but had been slightly subdued for much of 2017 due to a fall in new car sales as a result of some motorists preferring to import cars from Britain due to the sharp fall in the value of sterling against the euro.

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - The two sides sit within shouting distance, but when North and South Korea this week arranged the first official talks in more than two years, liaison officials spoke using desktop telephone consoles each the size of a small refrigerator.  The inter-Korean Liaison Office at the heart of this new spurt of dialogue between the two sides, sits at the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom, the only spot along the heavily fortified demilitarized zone that divides North and South Korea where troops from both sides stand face to face.  If the telephone operators wanted to, they could step out of their office and talk to their counterparts only 80 meters (260 feet) away in a separate building across the demarcation line.  \u201cLike what happened today (Friday), we mostly exchange what we call a \u2018telephone notice,\u2019 which basically means that a liaison officer calls the other side and reads a document carrying a proposal or official position on the other\u2019s proposal,\u201d said a senior official with South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Unification, which mans the phone and fax lines at the office.   \u201cBut other times, say, if you need to deliver a document with official seals, you would call them to arrange a face-to-face meeting at a certain time on the demarcation line.\u201d  That happened on a regular basis in the past, when relations were better, the official said, and now Seoul is hoping that these new high-level talks, scheduled for January 9, may bring back an era of more cordial relations between the two Koreas.  North Korean officials had effectively not answered the phone at Panmunjom since February 2016. During that time, South Korean officials would sometimes use a bull horn to shout messages across the border.  For the first time in nearly two years, the hotline was used on Wednesday. On the orders of leader Kim Jong Un, a North Korean official called the South in a preliminary step to a formal dialogue.  Officials have released few details of that conversation and several others that have since occurred, although some were decidedly anticlimactic.  After several calls on Wednesday, a North Korean official called to check the line. When the South\u2019s officer asked if the North had anything new to say, the official on the other end of the line said \u201cno\u201d and hung up, according to the Ministry of Unification.  But by Friday, the conversations paid off, officials said, with North Korea officially accepting the South\u2019s invitation for formal, face-to-face talks next week on North Korean participation at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea next month.  The phone line used to arrange the talks dates to the 1970s, with the current phone installed in 2009, the ministry said.  Photos of the phone show a large, wood-panelled console set into a desktop.  The system features a computer screen, disk drives, and USB ports, as well as two telephone handsets, one red and one green.  No other numbers can be called - the phones use a dedicated line between rooms on the two sides.  \u201cThe red phone is for incoming calls from North Korea and South Korea uses the green phone to make outgoing calls to the North,\u201d a unification ministry spokeswoman said. \u201cWe have installed two phones just in case one breaks or something.\u201d  The Unification Ministry employees who man the phones on the South side are experts in diplomatic protocol and have in the past played roles in face-to-face talks as well.  \u201cAt first sight it may seem a very simple job,\u201d the senior ministry official said. \u201cBut actually it\u2019s a very delicate job because they are not only in charge of the Panmunjom line but when inter-Korean meetings are held, they are also dispatched to the venue as a contact point between the two sides.\u201d  While the phone operators are discouraged from making any jokes about official issues during their conversations, they have in the past built a personal relationship with their counterparts during periods of close communication.  \u201cAs they man the position for a long time, they would talk to each other frequently and therefore naturally foster some personal rapport,\u201d the official said.  Less is known about the North Koreans on the other end of the line. A South Korean liaison officer who engaged in some of the recent conversations said he has never seen his counterparts\u2019 office on the other side, and referred further questions to the Unification Ministry.

          "title": "Fresh from Bannon feud, Trump meets Republicans to strategize for 2018",
          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Following a disruptive start to 2018, President Donald Trump will huddle with top Republicans on a two-day retreat starting on Friday to lay out legislative priorities for the year and discuss a strategy for pivotal November congressional elections.  Days after explosive comments by Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon left the White House in a defensive crouch, the president will sit down at Camp David with party leaders including House of Representative Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  Trump achieved the first major legislative win of his presidency in December with tax legislation long sought by his party and its supporters.  He is eager for more such victories and the White House has targeted infrastructure policy and a welfare overhaul as its top priorities. Immigration legislation, in particular a plan to help people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, is also on the agenda.  How and when to execute those priorities must be decided. While Trump and McConnell want to work on infrastructure first, Ryan is more interested in tackling welfare.  A White House official said the timing of legislation would be discussed as well as the political priority of giving Republicans substantive issues to highlight ahead of November elections when the party will seek to maintain control of Congress.  All 435 members in the House and a third of the 100 members in the Senate will be up for re-election. A Democratic takeover of one or both chambers could help stifle Trump\u2019s agenda.  The meeting at the presidential retreat in Maryland, which will include Trump Cabinet officials, follows an uproar over the description in a new book of an inept Trump White House and Bannon\u2019s suggestion the president\u2019s son and son-in-law committed treason by meeting with a Russian official during the 2016 campaign.  Trump broke with Bannon on Wednesday, saying his former adviser had \u201clost his mind,\u201d in a statement issued after comments attributed to Bannon in Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d were made public..  The strategy session will provide an opportunity to switch topics after the furor over the book, which goes on sale on Friday.  \u201cThe White House doesn\u2019t mind the optics after a few days of the president unloading on Bannon and making our views clear on the book, the president sits down and charts the course forward ... with the actual leaders of the Republican Party,\u201d a White House official said.  Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday that Wolff\u2019s book was a \u201ccomplete fantasy\u201d filled with tabloid gossip. She called for the conservative outlet Breitbart News to consider parting ways with Bannon, who leads the group and had pledged to campaign for anti-establishment Republican candidates in the 2018 elections.  Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn said the weekend meeting would help lawmakers and administration officials get on the same page about their priorities.  \u201cThis administration came into office perhaps not really knowing for sure that they would win the election, and was a little bit behind the curve in terms of preparing. Now I think they\u2019ve recognized that that sort of coordination is really important in order to get things done,\u201d he said.  \u201cSo I look forward to having those conversations and making sure that the president\u2019s priorities and our priorities are aligned.\u201d (Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell and Steve Holland; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

          "body": "BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Inflation in the euro zone slowed as expected in December, vindicating the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to keep its policy easy despite growing pressure from Germany and other richer euro zone countries.  The ECB has said it would continue buying bonds at least until September and keep rates low well after to raise inflation to its two percent target. But policymakers from the Netherlands, Germany and other northern countries have voiced their worries about an overly easy policy while economic growth is strong.  Prices in the euro zone grew by just 1.4 percent year on year last month, or 10 basis points slower than in the previous month due to smaller increases in food and energy prices. Once those components are stripped out, so called \u201ccore\u201d inflation was stable at 1.1 percent.  \u201cThere is no great pressure on the ECB to unwind QE,\u201d Kenneth Broux, a market strategist at Societe Generale, said.  The slight deceleration in headline inflation had been expected by the ECB and by market economists polled by Reuters.  But a stronger-than-expected German inflation reading of 1.6 percent last week raised market speculation about an upside surprise in euro zone price growth on Friday.  After the data the euro EUR= traded just below a four-month high of $1.2089 hit on Thursday, consolidating a rally that may prove a headache to the ECB by making euro zone imports cheaper and exports dearer.   \u201cThe euro is not helping above $1.20 because it should delay inflation returning to target,\u201d Societe Generale\u2019s Broux said.  The ECB is due to hold its next policy meeting on Jan 25 and investors will look for any sign of discomfort with the euro\u2019s strength in Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference.

          "title": "'World is doomed': Erdogan denounces U.S. justice after Turkish banker trial",
          "body": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Tayyip Erdogan denounced U.S. justice on Friday and suggested Turkey could rethink some bilateral agreements with Washington, after a U.S. court convicted a Turkish banker in a trial that included testimony of corruption by top Turkish officials.  In his first public comments on Wednesday\u2019s verdict, the Turkish president cast the case as American plot to undermine Turkey\u2019s government and economy - an argument likely to resonate with nationalist supporters.  \u201cIf this is the U.S. understanding of justice, then the world is doomed,\u201d Erdogan told a news conference before his departure to France for an official visit.  A U.S. jury convicted an executive of Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank (HALKB.IS) of evading Iran sanctions, at the close of the trial which has strained relations between the NATO allies. Some of the court testimony implicated senior Turkish officials, including Erdogan. Ankara has said the case was based on fabricated evidence.  Without being specific, Erdogan said the case put agreements between the two countries into jeopardy: \u201c....The bilateral accords between us are losing their validity. I am saddened to say this, but this is how it will be from now on.\u201d  Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry on Thursday condemned the conviction as unprecedented meddling in its internal affairs. The row has unnerved investors and weighed on the lira currency, which hit a series of record lows last year.  The court case has put pressure on relations between Washington and the biggest Muslim country in NATO, already strained since a 2016 failed coup in Turkey which Erdogan blames on followers of a cleric who lives in the United States.   Only last week the United States and Turkey lifted all visa restrictions against each other, ending a months-long visa dispute that began when Washington suspended visa services at its Turkish missions after two local employees of the U.S. consulate were detained on suspicion of links to the coup.   The Halkbank executive, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, was convicted on five of six counts, including bank fraud and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions law. The case was based on the testimony of a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab, who cooperated with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of leading a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.  In his testimony Zarrab implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said Erdogan, then prime minister, had personally authorised two Turkish banks to join the scheme.  Turkey says the case was based on fabricated evidence and has accused U.S. court officials of ties to the cleric Turkey blames for the coup attempt. The bank has denied any wrongdoing and said its transactions were in line with local and international regulations.  \u201cThe United States is carrying out ... a chain of plots, and these are not just legal but also economic plots,\u201d Erdogan said.

The currency is strengthening \u201cquite fast\u201d against the U.S. dollar at the beginning of 2018, Deputy Governor Mathee Supapongse said in a statement.  \u201cIf the currency changes so quickly that it affects adaptability of the private sector, the central bank is ready to take care of it,\u201d Mathee said.  He added that the appreciation of the baht was in line with regional currencies and was a result of a weakening dollar, along with inflows of capital into the region.  Later on Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak told reporters the Thai economy \u201cis improving a lot\u201d.  \u201cDirect investment and investors in capital markets is high,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not only in Thailand. We expect growth momentum to reach Asia, Asian stocks are up and so the baht is strengthening with regional peers.\u201d  The Thai economy depends significantly on exports, which have been under pressure from the baht\u2019s strength.  In 2017, during which exports increased, the baht strengthened more than 9 percent against the dollar.  On Friday, the baht touched its strongest in 39 months, at 32.14 against the dollar.  The central bank has forecast economic growth of 3.9 percent for 2017 and 2018. Growth in 2016 was 3.2 percent. The 2017 growth numbers will be released next month.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Friday it plans to create several \u201csuper-large\u201d coal mining companies by the end of 2020 as the world\u2019s biggest producer of the fuel ramps up years of efforts to streamline the fragmented sector and slash outdated capacity.  The country\u2019s National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a statement that by the end of 2020, China plans to form a number of mega-miners, each with the capacity to produce 100 million tonnes per year of coal, which will compete on the global market and help to modernize the sector.  Last year, China had more than 4,000 coal mines with a total capacity of 3.41 billion tonnes a year, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said in November.   Only six of China\u2019s coal mining companies are currently capable of producing more than 100 million tonnes per year, according to the China National Coal Association. Those include top coal miner Shenhua Group, China Coal Energy Group and Datong Coal Mine Group [DTCOA.UL].  The NDRC\u2019s plan follows the acquisition last year of state power company China Guodian Group Corp by Shenhua to create the world\u2019s largest utility.  That latest arranged marriage by the government was part of Beijing\u2019s effort to shake up its indebted and inefficient state sector, cut the number of companies and create globally competitive firms straddling many sectors including power generation, shipping and metals.  It also comes as Beijing deepens its war on smog with a push to boost cleaner energy consumption and limit the use of coal, which is used to produce the majority of China\u2019s electricity.  \u201cApart from eliminating excess capacity, the government is also seeking to improve coal firms\u2019 profitability by extending business into non-coal sectors, such as power generation and transportation,\u201d said Wu Qi, a research director at Hengfeng Bank Research Institute.  Among the steps proposed on Friday, the NDRC said it would encourage the coal industry to undertake more dealmaking with chemical coal, shipping and iron and steel firms.   It also called for the continued phase-out of outdated production by encouraging small-scale, inefficient mines to close, it said.  Under its five-year plan to 2020, China has pledged to eliminate around 800 million tonnes of outdated capacity and add around 500 million tonnes of advanced output. Coal output will be around 3.9 billion tonnes a year by 2020.  Reporting by Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Christian Schmollinger"

          "body": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is planning to cut taxes on travel and tourism in next month\u2019s federal budget and give more incentives to the $210 billion sector, government sources said, hoping to boost  economic growth and create more jobs.   The move could add to a domestic tourism boom in the world\u2019s second most populous nation, where low inflation and rising incomes are changing lifestyles and consumption patterns of an estimated 250 million middle-class Indians. With scores of destinations introduced on airline routes last year, air travel is also surging.  India\u2019s tourism sector grew over 10 percent in the six months ending September, compared to near 8 percent in the year-ago period. According to an industry report, tourism employs 40 million people in India and could add 10 million jobs in a decade.   \u201cWe\u2019ll announce measures in the budget to promote investment in the tourism sector,\u201d a top finance ministry official told Reuters, adding that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley favors lowering a 28 percent tax on hotel tariffs, and offering incentives to attract private investments.  If the moves come about, companies expected to benefit include airlines like IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe Aviation (INGL.NS), and Jet Airways (JET.NS) and hotel operators such as Indian Hotels (IHTL.NS), that owns the Taj Mahal chain and EIH Ltd (EIHO.NS) that operates the Oberoi hotels in India.   Tour operators including Cox & Kings (COKI.NS) and Thomas Cook (THOM.NS) are also likely to gain.   In India tourists, on average, pay 30 percent tax on hotel rooms and travel compared with less than 10 percent in Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia, said Pronab Sarkar, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO).  Another government official said the budget was likely to \u201csignificantly\u201d raise allocations for tourism infrastructure and raise income tax exemptions on investments in new hotels.   A third official, who is aware of the finance ministry\u2019s pre-budget consultations with industry groups, said Jaitley was expected to lower income tax on corporate profit, offer tax incentives on hotel construction, allocate more funds for new tourist trains and building roads to tourist destinations.  The government will offer incentives to more regional airlines this year to cover new, under-served airports, the official added.  All three officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to provide numbers or share further details.   India needs about 200,000 new hotel rooms, Tourism Minister K.J. Alphons told parliament this week.  \u201cWe have reached a plateau point and need more resources to create new infrastructure and develop tourist packages,\u201d Alphons later told Reuters, adding there was huge potential in developing areas that were not the usual tourist destinations.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said developing tourism, particularly in India\u2019s remote north-eastern states, is one of his top priorities.   Hotel occupancy levels in India are at their highest levels since 2008, even though many hotel chains have raised prices.  The need for rooms has been spotted by foreign investors with Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group (9984.T) backing start-ups like OYO Rooms, which has emerged as the largest aggregator of budget accommodation across the country with hotels in over 200  destinations.  One major driver of the domestic tourism boom has been the launch in 2017 of five regional budget airlines on over 100 routes, which are given incentives by the government to offer cut-price flights to uncovered and remote areas, encouraging thousands of families to explore flying for the first time.   Domestic airlines carried 10.6 million passengers in the first eleven months of 2017, up 17 percent from the year-ago period - encouraging some established players like Spicejet (SPJT.BO), Jet Airways and Vistara, a joint venture between the Tata Group and Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI), to start flights to new locations.  Tour operators said double-digit hikes in urban wages, coupled with an over 25 percent rise in the benchmark Sensex index .BSESN last year, have contributed to the domestic tourism boom.  At the same time over 9 million foreigners visited India in the first 11 months of 2017, up 15.6 percent from a year ago.  Domestic tourists, who account for 88 percent of the sector, are increasingly using online portals for hotel and travel bookings.   Travel portal MakeMyTrip (MMYT.O) reported a 186 percent jump in hotel bookings during the September quarter and its holiday package segment that includes hotel and flight bookings, saw a 71 percent increase in revenues over the same period.  Online operators say tourism could emerge as the new engine of growth after the IT sector but that it needs government support.   \u201cThe government must lower the tax burden, ease rules and build infrastructure if it wants to ensure 15-20 percent annual growth in tourism in coming years,\u201d said Sarkar of IATO.

          "body": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - China Development Bank (CDB), the biggest foreign lender to India\u2019s Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) (RLCM.NS), on Friday withdrew a petition seeking to drag the indebted  telecoms carrier into insolvency.  A lawyer for CDB told the National Company Law Tribunal that the Chinese bank had filed to withdraw the petition. The tribunal allowed CDB\u2019s plea to go forward.  CDB, which is owed around $2 billion along with two other Chinese banks, had filed the petition in November seeking insolvency proceedings against RCom, saying a large amount of loan principal and interest payments was overdue.  After RCom\u2019s debt-reduction plan, including an asset sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd [RELIB.UL], was announced last week, CDB told Reuters that it was in talks with RCom.   Details of the terms of a possible settlement between the Chinese bank and RCom were not immediately known. By 0847 GMT, RCom shares were trading 4.2 percent higher in a Mumbai market that was up 0.4 percent.  Last week, RCom signed a deal to sell most of its wireless assets to Jio in a deal people familiar with the matter said was worth nearly 240 billion rupees ($3.8 billion), subject to final adjustments at the time the transaction closes.  RCom has said it will use proceeds from the deal, expected to close by March, to repay part of the $7 billion it owes to Indian and foreign banks.  As part of an overall debt-reduction plan, RCom Chairman Anil Ambani said RCom would shift 100 billion rupees of debt to a special purpose vehicle housing its real estate assets, including a corporate park in a Mumbai suburb.  RCom still faces two other insolvency proceedings - one by the Indian unit of Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and the other by public relations firm Fortuna - over unpaid dues.  RCom has struggled under heavy debt and reported a string of losses during a price war, triggered by new entrant Jio which is controlled by Anil\u2019s elder brother and India\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani. That prompted RCom to reduce operations by shutting down its wireless business.  As it exits the wireless telecommunications segment, it will be left with a division housing its undersea cable business and internet data centers.  The firm is also looking for an equity injection from global strategic partners for further debt reduction and is in talks to sell a stake in the scaled-down business, RCom said last week.

          "body": "* Graphic: sterling and gilt yields bit.ly/2dgAXn1  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv  By Jemima Kelly  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Sterling steadied against the dollar and euro on Friday, ending the week at much the same levels it started it at, with traders keen to see new developments on Brexit negotiations before taking on new positions on the British currency.  Economic data released over the week have pointed to the economy picking up speed at the end of last year, with businesses growing more optimistic about the year ahead. But that has had little impact on the currency.  Numbers released on Friday showing Britain\u2019s economic productivity rose at its fastest rate in over six years during the three months to the end of September - though in absolute terms still barely above its level of nearly a decade ago - did not give the pound any additional support.  It was trading down 0.2 percent on the day at $1.3533 . It had hit a 3-1/2-month high of $1.3614 on Wednesday, less than half a cent away from its highest levels since the Brexit vote aftermath, but traders said it needed new catalysts before it could break any higher.  Sterling has climbed almost 4 percent against the dollar in the past two months.  \u201cDespite appearing to be the start of an appreciation trend, we believe that the sterling rally will peter out in the coming months,\u201d wrote analysts at BMI Research in a note to clients.  \u201cWe expect a pull-back towards the $1.30 level and sideways trading within a $1.30-1.35 band. On the other hand, if sterling were to break above long-term support around $1.40, this would be significant and force a fundamental re-think of our forecasts,\u201d they added.  A Reuters poll of currency strategists on Friday showed the pound is expected to mostly hold steady against both a shaky dollar and the firming euro this year, but much will hinge on progress in Britain\u2019s talks with Brussels on its withdrawal from the European Union.  The strategists, who were polled in the first week of 2018, were not brimming with optimism on how the next stage of talks will go, but most do not think the pound is set for another major fall, either.  Against the euro, the pound traded flat at 88.96 pence .  \u201cThe pound\u2019s ongoing resilience continues to support our view from over a year ago that a lot of bad news (has) already (been) priced in,\u201d said MUFG currency anaylsts.  \u201cAn important positive implication for the pound is that the risk of a more disorderly \u2018No Deal\u2019 Brexit outcome has diminished and the pound should strengthen if fears over a more disruptive and harder Brexit outcome do not materialise.\u201d (Editing by Alison Williams)"

          "body": "BRUSSELS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation slowed as expected in December because of slower growth in the price of energy and unprocessed food, but the core inflation measure, which excludes these volatile components, held steady, data showed on Friday.  The European Union\u2019s statistics office Eurostat estimated that consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.4 percent year-on-year last month, slowing from a 1.5 percent increase in November, as expected by economists.  This was mainly because energy prices grew 3.0 percent year-on-year in December, rather than 4.7 percent as in November and unprocessed food was 1.9 percent more expensive, rather than 2.4 percent as in November.  Without these two components, or what the European Central Bank calls core inflation, prices grew 1.1 percent year-on-year in December, the same as in November and October.  The ECB wants to keep headline inflation below, but close to two percent over the medium term and has been buying euro zone bonds on the secondary market to inject more cash in to the banking system and in this way boost credit to the economy.  From the start of this year, the bank halved its monthly bond purchases to 30 billion euros as the euro zone economy is powering ahead and unemployment is at its lowest in nine years, reducing the need for aggressive stimulus.

          "title": "Vietnam arrests fugitive tycoon deported from Singapore",
          "body": "SINGAPORE/HANOI (Reuters) - A fugitive Vietnamese property tycoon who is accused of spilling state secrets was arrested in Hanoi on Thursday after Singapore deported him, despite appeals that his life could be in danger in Vietnam.  Phan Van Anh Vu, 42, told his lawyers he was also a senior officer in Vietnam\u2019s secret police and was trying to get to Germany and could have details of an operation in which a wanted Vietnamese oil executive was spirited home from Berlin last year.  Vu\u2019s case put a new international spotlight on a sweeping crackdown on corruption in the communist state, where graft has flourished alongside years of rapid economic growth that have made it a prime destination for investors.  Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Public Security said on its website that Vu was arrested in Hanoi after being deported from Singapore and that it would \u201cinvestigate according to Vietnamese law\u201d.  Vu had been detained in Singapore on Dec. 28 as he tried to leave for neighboring Malaysia. Singapore authorities said he had entered the country on a passport with a false identity while carrying another Vietnamese passport with his real identity and also had a third passport in his possession.  Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Home Affairs said Vu was wanted under an Interpol \u201cRed Notice\u201d issued by Vietnam and had been removed by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.  A lawyer for Vu in Singapore said he was only informed about the deportation nearly three hours after Vu had been flown out.  \u201cI am disappointed that, despite our best efforts for our client, he was deported without our knowledge or given an opportunity to contest the allegations made against him,\u201d Remy Choo told Reuters.  Singapore has close diplomatic and trade ties to Vietnam and both share a concern at China\u2019s growing regional influence. This year, Singapore is also chairing the Association of Southeast Asian Nations grouping that aims to boost regional cooperation.  \u201cSpeed has been the enemy of both transparency and justice in this case,\u201d said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for New York-based Human Rights Watch.  \u201cSingapore deserves utter condemnation for forcing him back to face what will certainly be a kangaroo court trial, and quite possibly a death sentence.\u201d      Serious security offences can carry the death penalty in Vietnam although that also depends on the motivation and the degree of damage caused. Vietnamese police have not said which secrets Vu is accused of revealing.    Police published a wanted notice for Vu on Dec. 21 after failing to find him at his home in the central resort city of Danang, where he had been nicknamed \u201cAluminium Vu\u201d for his background making window and door frames.  For years, he had been a prominent business figure in the city with public connections to authorities, among them the head of its communist party, who was fired in October for misconduct.  Dozens of officials and business people have been arrested in a crackdown on corruption that gathered pace last year after changes at the top of the communist party gave greater sway to the security establishment.  The fight against corruption is broadly welcomed in Vietnam, but government critics say they believe it is also being used to undermine officials linked to the administration of former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung.  The crackdown drew global attention last summer when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping former oil executive Trinh Xuan Thanh from a Berlin park.  Vu\u2019s German lawyer, Victor Pfaff, told Reuters that as a senior employee in Vietnam\u2019s secret police Vu would have known about the disappearance of Thanh and that he had important information about the case.  German officials did not comment on Vu\u2019s case.  Reporting by John Geddie in SINGAPORE and Mi Nguyen in HANOI; Editing by Clarence Fernandez"

          "body": "MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - Opponents of the euro are rearing their heads again, this time in Italy. Matteo Salvini, leader of the country\u2019s anti-immigration Northern League party, has reiterated his opposition to the single currency. Growing Italian discontent with the European Union could help to make the issue a vote-winner in elections planned for March 4. Despite a widespread economic revival, monetary union remains a political target.  Investors thought they had put the threat of a euro breakup to bed after opponents of the currency bloc were trounced in French, Dutch and German elections last year. But they are springing up elsewhere. Salvini, who has an outside chance of becoming Italy\u2019s next prime minister, this week told newspaper La Repubblica he remained convinced that the euro was a mistake and vowed to rectify the error. In his manifesto, Salvini pledges to renegotiate EU treaties in order to regain political and monetary sovereignty. He has also spoken of introducing a parallel currency.  The tactic is probably designed to steal votes from the 5-Star Movement, currently projected to become Italy\u2019s largest single party with 28 percent of votes. The anti-establishment group had previously promised a referendum on leaving the single currency. But in a bid to appease moderate voters, leader Luigi Di Maio last year declared the plan would be a last resort. Relative political calm and resurgent growth in the euro zone\u2019s third-largest economy helped propel Milan\u2019s FTSE MIB Index to a two-year high in November, making it among Europe\u2019s best-performing indexes.  Yet bashing Brussels could yield political gains in the boot-shaped country. Once staunchly pro-EU Italians have become more sceptical about the union. According to a Eurobarometer poll published in November only 34 percent of Italian respondents said they tended to trust the EU, the lowest level in the bloc outside Greece, Britain and France.  Anti-euro rhetoric can backfire, though. Marine Le Pen\u2019s vague plan to pull out of the single currency cost her votes in last year\u2019s French presidential election. If the threat of a return to the lira becomes too real, savers could get cold feet. Even so, Italy\u2019s election is shaping up to be another political test for the euro.

          "body": "OSLO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Budget carrier Norwegian Air reported stronger-than-expected December passenger traffic figures on Friday, a day after raising 2018 capacity forecasts, sending its shares surging more than 12 percent.  The rapidly expanding airline, which offers transatlantic flights as well as European short haul, said late on Thursday that bookings for the coming year were stronger than this time last year, even when taking into account significant growth in the size of its fleet.  The company raised its 2018 capacity growth target (ASK) to 40 percent from an earlier 35 percent, thanks to higher fleet utilisation. The ASK figure is based on the number of seats multiplied by the distance flown over a year.  At 1010 GMT, Norwegian Air\u2019s shares traded 12.7 percent higher at 213.9 Norwegian crowns, just below an earlier peak of 214.4 crowns, the highest level seen since early November.  Norwegian\u2019s shares fell by 39 percent last year as investors fretted over rising costs and high debts accompanying its fast expansion into long-haul flights, leading to heavy short-selling of its stock.  The company\u2019s traffic, measured by revenue-generating passenger kilometres (RPK) rose by 32 percent year-on-year in the final month of 2017, beating a forecast of 30.9 percent in a Reuters poll of analysts.  Its yield, a measure of revenues per passenger carried and kilometres flown, was steady year-on-year at 0.37 Norwegian crowns, while analysts had expected a drop to 0.36 crowns.  In a statement late on Thursday the company said expenses would only rise slightly despite rising fuel costs, as the higher fleet utilisation partly compensates.  \u201cWe consider the traffic figures highly positive,\u201d brokers Pareto Securities, which have a buy rating on the stock, said in a note to clients.  \u201cThe new 2018 guidance released yesterday emphasizes that outlook for cost is improving and hence we still argue that the long-term case remains intact,\u201d it added.  Danske Bank, which has a \u201chold\u201d rating on the stock, welcomed the passenger data and stronger outlook, but cautioned that Norwegian\u2019s costs for 2018 could turn out higher than the company projects.

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Chinese currency, the yuan, was firmer against the U.S. dollar on Friday, capping its fourth consecutive week of gains, aided by China\u2019s solid economic data and tighter liquidity as well as expectations of more foreign capital inflows.  In the spot market CNY=CFXS, the yuan opened at 6.4810 per dollar and was at 6.4851 by the 0830 GMT domestic close, scoring a four-week winning streak against the greenback.   The offshore yuan was trading 0.10 percent away from the onshore spot at 6.4806 per dollar.   Confidence in the yuan has been building up on signs of resilience in China\u2019s economy. A blizzard of data in coming weeks is expected to show China\u2019s economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note, but activity has likely remained more resilient than expected. Sources told Reuters China will keep its target for economic growth at \u201caround 6.5 percent\u201d in 2018, unchanged from last year.  Analysts also attributed the yuan\u2019s strength to tighter liquidity conditions in China\u2019s financial system, which has kept interest rates elevated.   China\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bond yield CNY10YT=RR hovered near 4 percent, the highest in three years, compared with 2.45 percent for 10-year U.S. Treasuries US10YT=TWEB, as Beijing\u2019s deleveraging campaign helped widen the spread.           The yuan\u2019s recent performance is \u201cperhaps reflective of the tight liquidity conditions onshore as well as optimism offshore about portfolio inflows,\u201d National Australia Bank wrote in a note.  \u201cBarring a strong recovery in the USD in pace and extent in coming weeks, capital flows may still be constructive for CNY and CNH and may push USD/CNY towards 6.45 immediate key support.\u201d   Meanwhile, the U.S. currency\u2019s lack of traction was highlighted overnight as the dollar failed to draw support from the stronger-than-expected jobs report.

          "body": "(Reuters) - A rough patch for the U.S. dollar, which just recorded its worst annual performance in 14 years, is forecast to ease in 2018 but is not over yet, according to a majority of foreign exchange analysts in a Reuters poll.  The greenback started last year on a strong footing, underpinned by newly-elected President Donald Trump\u2019s promises to cut taxes and spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure. However, the currency fell 10 percent by end-year.  Most currency strategists did not foresee that, with predictions made this time last year for dollar appreciation ending up among the most inaccurate start-of-year forecasts for the ensuing 12 months since the financial crisis nearly a decade ago.  At one point in December the dollar did pop up more than two percent as speculators bet Congress would deliver legislation for sweeping tax cuts to corporations and individuals, which was delivered at the end of the year.   Still, the path of least resistance for the dollar is down. The euro and other major currencies are expected to make further modest gains against the dollar by year-end, according to a Reuters poll of 70 foreign exchange analysts taken Jan 2-4.  \u201cThe dollar is going to remain on a downward trajectory through the course of the next year,\u201d said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.  \u201cWe have a market which is already discounting additional Fed tightening and the tax measures and fiscal expansion are only going to be moderately stimulatory to the economy.\u201d  Stretch, like other analysts, is concerned about the more than 1 trillion dollars of extra borrowing over the next decade to fund the tax cuts, but does not think that is set to put direct downward pressure on the dollar at this point.   \u201cThe fiscal story is important, but it\u2019s what\u2019s happening elsewhere in central bank terms I think (that is) probably more dynamic,\u201d he said.  But with the Federal Reserve widely expected to deliver three interest rate increases this year, any big shift in the dollar in either direction would have to come from a significant deviation from that set path.  \u201cEven if the Fed does deliver the three hikes which they are currently planning, we just don\u2019t think it will be enough to reverse the dollar weakening trend which is currently in place,\u201d said Lee Hardman, currency economist at MUFG.  For now, with inflation pressures still tame, the outlook for bond yields in a December Reuters poll of fixed-income strategists showed most of them sanguine, too, expecting only about 50 basis points more added to the 10-year note this year.   Asked how they expected the dollar to fare against major currencies this year, a majority of the forecasters in the latest Reuters poll said it would perform better than last year - not a hard thing to do given how bad last year was.   Currency speculators have trimmed their net short dollar bets to their lowest since November, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for the final week of last year.  The euro, which also had its best run since 2003 last year, is forecast to weaken slightly over the next three to six months before moving up to trade slightly higher at $1.210 in a year\u2019s time, up slightly from where it is now.   The euro zone economy is having one of its best runs since the single currency was launched, outperforming its peers. It is forecast to continue to grow at a robust pace.  With the European Central Bank expected to put an end to its quantitative easing programme this year, the risk is that the euro performs even better than currently predicted.   \u201cWe think the ECB will bring QE to an end this year and then also start to soften their forward guidance over the first rate hike, which could bring expectations of a first rate hike into focus later this year and add additional momentum to the euro,\u201d said Hardman.

          "title": "White House, senators seek Iran measure ahead of nuclear deadline",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators and Trump administration officials met at the White House on Thursday, hoping to hammer out compromise legislation to tighten restrictions on Iran while keeping Washington in an international nuclear deal with Tehran.  Senators Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Ben Cardin, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, had an evening meeting with President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, to discuss possible legislation, Senate and White House aides said.  The stakes have risen in the past week with anti-government protests in several Iranian cities over economic hardships and corruption, the boldest challenge to Iran\u2019s leadership in a decade.  Worrying European allies who co-signed the 2015 accord, Trump has railed against the deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for loosening sanctions reached under his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. In October, the Republican president announced that he would not certify that staying in the pact was in the U.S. national security interest, and threatened to pull out if lawmakers did not act to toughen it.  Members of Congress have been working since to come up with a bipartisan compromise that would give Trump enough political cover not to reimpose sanctions on Iranian oil before a deadline next week, an action that would kill the pact.  Aides said they were looking at measures including ending the requirement that Trump re-certify the agreement every 90 days and changing some of the so-called sunset provisions to allow the reimposition of U.S. sanctions, with no timetable, if Iran\u2019s nuclear program reaches certain thresholds.  Ahead of the meeting, Corker said he hoped enough progress had been made that Trump might not restore the sanctions.  \u201cMy sense is there\u2019s a little momentum right now, and it doesn\u2019t feel to me like we\u2019re in a place where the president might do that, but who knows,\u201d he told reporters at the Capitol.  Corker said the protests in Iran made it more important that Washington not do anything to shift the focus from Iran\u2019s government. \u201cThe last thing we need to do from my perspective would be to turn that attention to us,\u201d he said.  The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet Friday at 3 p.m. to discuss Iran, days after U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley called for an emergency session to discuss the protests.  The U.S. proposal was dismissed by Russia, another participant in the nuclear deal, as \u201charmful and destructive,\u201d with \u201cno role for the United Nations Security Council in this issue.\u201d  A procedural vote which no council member can veto could be used to stop the meeting. If nine of the 15 countries on the council vote to stop the meeting that would end the discussion.   \u201cThis is a matter of fundamental human rights for the Iranian people, but it is also a matter of international peace and security,\u201d said Haley in a statement late on Thursday.  \u201cIt will be telling if any country tries to deny the Security Council from even having this discussion.\u201d   Separately, the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday sanctioned five Iranian-based entities it said were owned or controlled by an industrial firm responsible for developing and producing Iran\u2019s solid-propellant ballistic missiles.  \u201cThese sanctions target key entities involved in Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, which the Iranian regime prioritizes over the economic well-being of the Iranian people,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.  The department said the sanctioned entities - the Shahid Eslami Research Center, Shahid Kharrazi Industries, Shahid Moghaddam Industries, Shahid Sanikhani Industries and Shahid Shustari Industries - were subordinated to the Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group.  The sanctions freeze any property the entities hold in the United States and prohibit Americans from dealing with them.

          "title": "Investors sense opportunities in Big Oil - but mind the gap",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are gaining confidence - up to a point - that 2018 will be the year of oil stocks.  While shares in top energy companies have risen since mid-2017, they have failed to keep step with recovering crude markets, opening up a historically unusual performance gap. Big oil stocks have also underperformed broader equity indexes.  Uncertainty over whether the crude rally can stick and fears that advances in electric vehicles will undermine longer-term demand for oil still overshadow the sector.  But a brighter outlook for oil prices compared with the slump of 2014-15 - coupled with a revival in energy companies\u2019 profits and cash generation after three years of brutal cuts - could mark a turning point, according to investors and a string of global banks.   \u201c2017 was a challenging year for investors but there are now real opportunities in the energy sector,\u201d said Olivia Markham, portfolio manager at BlackRock Commodities Income Investment Trust. She expects oil prices to rise gradually by 2020 as supplies tighten due to a dive in investment in recent years.  UBS, RBC and JP Morgan have put out strongly positive outlooks for the sector in recent weeks, while Barclays analysts predicted on Thursday that earnings for the European integrated oil stocks could grow 20 percent from the third quarter.  Optimists point to developments like Shell\u2019s (RDSa.L) raising in November of its cash flow outlook to $30 billion from $25 billion by 2020, assuming prices at $60 a barrel.  \u201cAnnus Mirabilis. Highest free cashflow in a decade bodes well for 2018,\u201d Bernstein said in its outlook for European oil majors.  Figures for last year are grim, due largely to a dismal first half. The MSCI world energy index .dMIWO0EN00PUS, which tracks top oil stocks, gained just 1.3 percent even though Brent crude hit 2-1/2 year highs. Europe\u2019s oil and gas sector.SXEP, which includes Shell, Total (TOTF.PA), BP (BP.L) and Eni (ENI.MI), was the worst-performing in the region.   Oil majors\u2019 shares typically move in step with prices of the crude that they extract, but that correlation broke down last year. Since June, the MSCI index has gained 20 percent but Brent LCOc1 shot up 50 percent to around $68 a barrel, after OPEC and other major producers agreed to cut output.  The majors are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, determined to maintain the capital discipline they imposed during the slump.  With production from U.S. shale deposits expected to increase sharply, scepticism remains over whether crude can stay at current levels.  \u201cThere\u2019s little conviction on the oil price sustainability both from the market and from the oil majors because no one is touching capex plans or investment. Everyone is waiting to understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Italian fund manager Banor SIM.  As well as slashing spending, the majors made tens of thousands of staff redundant and sold off assets to adapt to lower oil prices which, despite the recent gains, remain far below levels above $100 in 2011-14. Such savings have led to sharp increases in earnings in recent quarters.  Whether the sector can extend the share rally and close the performance gap in 2018 depends on a belief that majors can still prosper should oil prices fall back again.  \u201cFrom here it\u2019s a question of whether or not investors think something has really changed in the industry, that you can still have earnings improving even if the macro doesn\u2019t help you out,\u201d said Peter Hackworth, oil equity analyst at Goldman Sachs.   As well as the strong cash flow generation at the European majors, early signs of capital discipline among U.S. explorers and producers also point to a better picture for the sector this year.  Goldman predicts big oil firms will return 13 percent in 2018, ahead of a forecast 9 percent rise in the Brent price.   One crucial component in winning back investors\u2019 confidence is a return to paying dividends fully in cash. Offering the option of taking dividends in stock has saved the majors billions upfront but diluted their earnings per share.  Shell and BP have both made enough revenue in recent quarters to boost their payouts. Goldman Sachs estimates most big oil firms will have scrapped scrip dividends or made share buy-backs which offset the dilution in the next 12 months.  Average dividend yields of 5.5 percent will be more than covered by cash flow this year, Hackworth said.  But not all investors have yet accepted the message that current payout levels will continue.  \u201cThe market is still discounting these dividends as unsustainable whereas today, right now, they are sustainable. So I think the market is overreacting,\u201d said Eric Moore, European income fund manager at Miton, who has been increasing his oil holdings in the past year.  Moore\u2019s fund holds BP, Shell, Statoil STL.OL, Eni and Premier Oil. (PMO.L)  Analysts have also been revising up their earnings forecasts since October after sharp downgrades earlier in 2017. Any uptick in mergers and acquisitions - noticeably absent as the majors concentrated on restructuring rather than purchases during the slump \u2013 could also boost the sector.   Investors remain wary that oil demand may peak due to eventual mass adoption of battery-powered cars and more curbs on fossil fuel emissions by industry to meet environmental targets.  \u201cElectric vehicles and government policies on carbon have led investors to question the longer-term outlook for oil,\u201d Blackrock\u2019s Markham said.   Some are hedging their bets, buying shares in battery companies and chipmakers involved in making electric cars while lessening their exposure to pure oil plays.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   But the shift to cleaner energy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean investors are dumping the oil majors. Many are sticking with them but favoring companies which put more emphasis on renewables.   Nick Davis, European income fund manager at Polar Capital, said he prefers Total, which is investing more in gas as well as venturing into battery and solar power.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   But in the shorter term, and with the electric vehicle picture still unclear, stocks do not yet fully price in these risks, analysts said.  Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson said cash preservation remains the key for investors focusing on returns more than growth. For him, BP, Shell, Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) offer the best proposition in 2018, he said in a note.  \u201cThe historical investment model which assumed that higher oil prices would always lead to higher share prices in energy appears disrupted. It failed in 2017 and will again in 2018, in our view.\u201d   GRAPHIC - Oil prices and energy shares: here  Reporting by Helen Reid and Ron Bousso, Editing by Dmitry Zhdannikov and David Stamp"

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks and currencies had a strong start to the year fuelled by solid growth numbers, perky commodity markets and a tepid dollar with equities on track for the best weekly performance since July.  MSCI\u2019s emerging market index rose 0.4 percent to take weekly gains to 3.4 percent - the best start to a new year since 2006. Asia ex-Japan shares hit a fresh decade high, hovering close to an all-time record led by gains in South Korea.  Risk appetite has been whetted by a run of solid data from both developing and emerging economies, confirming the economic expansion is firmly on track.  Thursday\u2019s latest U.S. ADP National Employment Report further boosted the mood, showing private employers added a forecast-beating 250,000 jobs in December, and stoking expectations for key U.S. non-farm payroll data out later on Friday.  The upbeat outlook and a tepid dollar also fuelled commodity markets with the Thomson Reuters Core Commodity CRB index at its highest since October 2015 and oil prices holding near the highest levels since May 2015.  \u201cThat\u2019s providing a macro tailwind for emerging markets \u2013 oil and global trade both speak to stronger emerging markets exports and emerging markets growth, which helps lift people\u2019s expectations on a whole range of EM assets,\u201d said Koon Chow, strategist at UBP.  Currencies were trading more mixed on the day but painted an equally upbeat picture for the first trading week of the year.  Turkey\u2019s lira and Russia\u2019s rouble are on track to end the week around 1 percent stronger against the dollar.  South Africa\u2019s rand eyed an eighth straight week of gains - the longest weekly winning streak since late 2002.  However, analysts thought the cheer may not last, with the latest Reuters poll showing expectations for the rand to weaken by more than 12 percent by end-2018 as the country\u2019s fiscal woes return.  Inspired by the benign backdrop, governments continued to tap international capital markets. Overnight, Argentina sold $9 billion in a three-part dollar bond, raising nearly a third of its expected financing needs for 2018 in a deal that was 2.4 times oversubscribed.

Farage, who as UKIP leader convinced Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s predecessor, David Cameron, to call the Brexit referendum and then helped lead the campaign for Brexit, has repeatedly scolded May for being too weak in the EU divorce talks.  He said in a video clip posted on Twitter that he would meet the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday and appealed for people to send him their questions to put to Barnier.  \u201cI thought who is in there representing the views of the 17.4 million people?

          "body": "(Adds final figures, details on diesel)  By Costas Pitas  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - British new car sales recorded their biggest drop since 2009 last year, falling 5.7 percent due to uncertainty over potential new diesel charges and weakening consumer confidence since Brexit, an industry body said on Friday.  Demand for new diesel cars plunged 17.1 percent, and with some buyers switching to petrol motors, average CO2 emissions for new cars rose for the first time in two decades, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.  Total registrations ended 2017 at 2.54 million, with drops among both business and private consumers, and are set to fall up to 7 percent this year, the SMMT forecast.  Britain said last year it would hike the levy on new diesel cars that do not meet the latest emissions standards after months of uncertainty over a potential diesel scrappage scheme and confusion over government plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2040.  Since the 2015 Volkswagen emissions cheating scandal, some major cities including Madrid, Paris and Athens have announced plans particularly focused on cutting diesel emissions including bans, fines and restrictions.  Once touted as a cleaner alternative to petrol, which emits more CO2, diesel has come under fire for releasing other toxic fumes.  Car sales in Britain have previously been a leading indicator for the performance of the economy and last year\u2019s drop is the biggest since demand nosedived in 2009 after the financial crisis, but comes after record highs in 2015 and 2016.  Sales in December fell 14.4 percent and SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said further drops were likely in the coming months.  \u201cThe two main reasons are business-led and consumer confidence and the confusion around diesel which has caused hold-off,\u201d he said of last year\u2019s fall.  \u201cThe first quarter is going to be tough and March (last year) in particular was an all-time record month. We ain\u2019t going to get that next March.\u201d  Britain\u2019s automotive sector is also concerned its cars could face tariffs of up to 10 percent and be hit by customs delays if the government fails to strike the right Brexit deal.  There are investment decisions which are pending as companies await clarification on the terms of a transitional deal which will bridge Britain\u2019s exit from the EU in March 2019 into a new relationship with the bloc, Hawes said.  \u201cSome of those decisions are overdue, they need clarity urgently and certainly the turn of the first quarter is what they have been saying to me,\u201d he said.  Honda is one of several carmakers considering contingency plans involving possible extra warehousing and stockpiling of parts and has said it needs clarity by March on a transitional deal.  Hawes said any additional cost borne by British plants could hit the sector.  \u201cThat\u2019s the thin end of the wedge ... How do you secure that next piece of investment when you\u2019re less competitive because you\u2019ve got to warehouse?\u201d (Editing by Mark Potter)"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - European shares powered higher on Friday, with the British and Swiss benchmarks hitting records, propelled by optimism for a strengthening regional economy and gains in U.S. equities overnight.   The pan-European STOXX 600  index was up 0.5 percent by 0944 GMT, holding at a two-month high, while euro zone blue chips .STOXX50E rose 0.9 percent, building on strong gains in the previous session.   The first trading week of the new year was shaping up to be the best for euro zone stocks .STOXXE since last May, as the index has shrugged off a strengthening of the single currency that can dampen export earnings.   \u201cThere is little impediment for continued gains whilst economic conditions that we\u2019ve seen over the last few months continue, and there\u2019s every reason to expect that to continue to be the case,\u201d Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.  \u201cEvery now and then when things are right you do get quite spectacular advances.\u201d  U.S. jobs numbers on Thursday showed U.S. private employers added more jobs than expected in December, propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI past the 25,000-mark for the first time. Investors were watching U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later on Friday.  Euro zone stocks were set for a weekly gain of 2.7 percent.  Markets outside of the euro zone saw several record levels broken. Switzerland's blue chip SMI .SSMI index rose 0.4 percent to an all-time high, while Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE jumped to another record.  Financials drove gains in Europe on the day, with the banking index .SX7P rising 0.6 percent.  \u201cMore than cyclicals we are looking for lower valued areas like banks, telecoms, energy,\u201d John Surplice, pan-European equities fund manager at Invesco Perpetual, said.  \u201cThe areas we are cautious on are the ones we would deem bond proxy sectors - regulated utilities, food and beverage, long duration assets that have been re-priced significantly during the crisis,\u201d Surplice added.   European autos .SXAP was the top-performing sector, up 1.4 percent, while every other sector traded in positive territory.  Shares in Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI), Peugeot (PEUP.PA) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) were among the biggest gainers, up 2.8 percent to 4.2 percent.     However, shares in British car insurer Admiral Group (ADML.L) tumbled around 5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX on the back of a downgrade from JPMorgan as well as some weak UK new car sales data.  Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) was another underperformer, down 4 percent after top customer Apple (AAPL.O) said that its products were hit by a chip flaw.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The value of the European hedge fund run by Crispin Odey dropped by around 20.5 percent last year as the veteran British investor\u2019s bets against the global economy hit the performance of his main fund.  The fund\u2019s euro share class also slumped by 8.2 percent last month, Odey told Reuters. The figures were first reported by Bloomberg.  Odey came to prominence during the 2008 financial crisis when he shorted banking shares, a lucrative wager that helped him to earn almost 28 million pounds ($38 million) that year.  More recently, however, his fund\u2019s performance has suffered heavily after he took a negative stance on the outlook for the global economy and bearish positions against shares that have not borne fruit.  His flagship fund experienced its worst-ever losses of almost 50 percent in 2016, a year that Odey has since described as awful.  His eponymous firm, Odey Asset Management, also saw its performance fees plunge to 60,000 pounds in the 12 months to April 5 2017, from 19.3 million pounds in the same period a year earlier, according to a company filing last month.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Global distressed-debt specialists are stepping up their dealmaking in China after a decade, betting that the country is becoming serious about developing a market to tackle its $256 billion of official non-performing loans (NPLs).  Groups such as Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and Bain Capital Credit LP made their first investments in recent months, amid surging write-offs by banks and indications that China\u2019s commercial bad loans market is set to deepen.  Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK.N) last month agreed to buy a portfolio of distressed loans with a face value of 3.1 billion yuan ($476.70 million), its fifth deal, according to Tony Rao, a partner with law firm Alpha & Leader, which helped provide due diligence on the deal.  More overseas cash is set to enter the market in 2018, said Rao, in spite of rising competition with local buyers that has sent average prices above 50 cents on the dollar.   Oaktree declined to comment.  NPLs on commercial bank balance sheets officially amounted to 1.67 trillion yuan ($256.80 billion) at the end of September, or 1.74 percent of all loans. Overdue loans - those not yet technically considered bad - reached 3.4 trillion yuan. Many analysts estimate actual amounts are much higher.   Loan write-offs by commercial lenders, one indication of how deeply banks are cleaning house, jumped 50 per cent to about 1.4 trillion yuan in 2016, according to estimates by UBS analyst Jason Bedford.  An initial wave of foreign interest in China\u2019s bad loans a decade ago, led by big western banks, faded as deals failed to materialize and legal uncertainties multiplied.  But China\u2019s distressed-debt market has become more commercialized since then. Once the monopoly of the Big Four asset management companies established in 1999 to take over bad loans from the country\u2019s biggest lenders, the market today includes at least 55 regional managers while sales channels for bad loans now include online auctions, over-the-counter trades at local asset exchanges as well as NPL securitization.  \u201cThe market has broadened,\u201d said Phil Groves, president of DAC Management LLC, a China-focused alternative investment manager and bad-loan servicing company that was bought by Blackstone last year. \u201cThere\u2019s more to buy, bigger portfolios, and different types of credit available.\u201d  Blackstone acquired its first-ever Chinese commercial loan portfolio for $195 million in August - the same month that Bain Capital Credit did its first-ever deal with the purchase of $200 million in mostly real estate backed loans in the coastal province of Jiangsu.  Bain is now looking at other real estate-backed portfolios and building a loan servicing team to handle future deals, said Kei Chua, Bain\u2019s Hong Kong-based managing director.  Global distressed-debt players said they\u2019re encouraged by ongoing legal and structural changes in China - particularly in coastal regions - that has seen the emergence of professional appraisers and brokers, databases to check asset titles and liens, and greater certainty in the courts.  Foreign investors have for now mostly stuck to real estate deals because that market is better established with easily-valued collateral. Oaktree\u2019s latest portfolio, consisting of 178 loans in China\u2019s Pearl River Delta, is mostly but not entirely property-backed, according to Alpha & Leader\u2019s Rao.     China\u2019s bad loans market is, however, dominated by local distressed funds, many of which set up in the last two years, fund managers and advisers said, which has increased competition and raised NPL prices.   A national industry association set up just two years ago has grown to more than 600 members from 200 initially.   \u201cThere isn\u2019t a national market,\u201d said Deng Yanshan, executive director for investment at Lakeshore Capital, a domestic asset manager which oversees 2.5 billion yuan in funds. \u201cThis is still a localized business that\u2019s based in provinces, counties and cities.\u201d  International firms must also deal with currency controls and related government approvals - creating an execution risk, particularly on timing and hedging costs, that their local rivals do not have to bear.   But Ted Osborn, an NPL specialist partner at PwC in Hong Kong, said the outlook for global distressed asset buyers remains good.    \u201cWhen China gets serious and needs to start selling big chunks of bad loans, foreigners are still the only ones with organized capital to do it.\u201d  Reporting By Matthew Miller; Additional reporting by Engen Tham in Shanghai; Editing by Jennifer Hughes and Muralikumar Anantharaman"

Global equity markets have begun 2018 with their best week in more than a year, continuing last year\u2019s rally that has seen volatility plunge and risk appetite surge.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.15 percent, above 524 points and at a record high.  European markets opened firmer after Asian shares approached record levels. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.4 percent, holding at a two-month high, and the first trading week of the new year looks set to be the best for Euro zone stocks since May, as shares shrug off a stronger single currency that could dampen export earnings.  The U.S. dollar failed to draw any strength from better-than-expected private payrolls data on Thursday and manufacturing numbers earlier this week, leaving the greenback around a four-month low against the euro.  With two U.S. interest rate hikes already baked into market expectations, traders believe there is more upside room for the euro as the European Central Bank may move to rein in its monetary largesse faster than the market anticipates.  Investors will also be looking closely at crucial December inflation data out of the euro zone on Friday, as well as the monthly employment report in the United States, along with average hourly earnings data, due at 1330 GMT.  The data could give some clues to the likely path for when central banks will step up monetary tightening.  \u201cCurrency markets broadly know what the Fed is going to do this year but the ECB monetary policy may be the surprise package of 2018,\u201d said Richard Falkenhall, senior FX strategist at SEB in Stockholm.  The dollar has weakened as U.S. long-term bond yields have remained low, despite the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates three times last year.  The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 2.460 percent , below its seven-month peak of 2.504 percent touched on Dec. 21.  Those levels are little different from about a year ago, even after the Fed hiked interest rates and with market expectations for another three hikes in 2018.  Expectations that inflation will remain low as wage growth has been slower than before the 2007-2008 financial crisis has capped U.S. long-term bond yields.  Elsewhere, oil prices slipped from highs last seen in 2015 after soaring U.S. production undermined a 10-percent rally from lows hit in December driven by tightening supply and political tensions in Iran.  Gold prices dipped from the previous session\u2019s 3-1/2 month high, ahead of the U.S. non-farm payroll data, but remained on track for their fourth straight weekly gain.  Signs of the investor appetite for risk more broadly were evident in Greece, where the euro zone member\u2019s 10-year borrowing costs hit their lowest in 12 years on Friday.  The country, once on the verge of defaulting on its debts, has benefited from expectations of a clean exit from its bailout this year and a revival in the economy.  \u201cGreece\u2019s fundamentals have been on the mend and investors have been looking at the yield pick-up they get from investing in that debt,\u201d said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.  \u201cAlso, a rising tide lifts all boats - with the euro zone economy doing so well, it\u2019s a very \u2018risk on\u2019 environment and that is benefiting Greece.\u201d  For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in \u2018Live Markets\u2019 in the search bar.

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China\u2019s central bank has moved to restrict the issuance of negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) this year, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday, as the government intensifies its campaign to reduce borrowing risks.  The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) advised banks via so-called \u201cwindow guidance\u201d to follow a new formula that puts a cap on NCD issues during the year.  Banks looking to issue NCDs in any given year must apply for permission from the PBOC around the start of the year, specifying a maximum amount, or annual quota, that sets the limit on the amount of issued NCDs they can have outstanding.  Banks have been told their applications for 2018 quotas would be rejected if their interbank borrowings plus the requested amount of NCD quotas exceeded one-third of its total liabilities, the sources said.  NCD issuance has exploded in recent years as lenders, especially small ones, use this once loosely-regulated short-term debt instrument to fund longer-term investments, often through shadow banking. Outstanding NCDs exceeded 8 trillion yuan last year, compared with around 3 trillion yuan at the end of 2015, according to Soochow Securities.    NCDs are issued by banks and traded between financial institutions in the interbank market.

Although China has already tightened scrutiny on NCDs since then - the central bank will include them in its quarterly risk assessments this year targeting banks with assets of more than 500 billion yuan ($77.06 billion) - the new instructions point to a harsher stance as they now appear to target all banks.  \u201cThe PBOC gave us guidance to follow the formula,\u201d said an official at a rural commercial lender with assets below 500 billion yuan. \u201cIf you don\u2019t follow, the annual issuance quota won\u2019t get approved.\u201d  Window guidance refers to informal instructions from regulators that are often communicated orally with no written notice.

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China\u2019s central bank has moved to restrict the issuance of negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) this year, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday, as the government intensifies its campaign to reduce borrowing risks.  The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) advised banks via so-called \u201cwindow guidance\u201d to follow a new formula that puts a cap on NCD issues during the year.  Banks looking to issue NCDs in any given year must apply for permission from the PBOC around the start of the year, specifying a maximum amount, or annual quota, that sets the limit on the amount of issued NCDs they can have outstanding.  Banks have been told their applications for 2018 quotas would be rejected if their interbank borrowings plus the requested amount of NCD quotas exceeded one-third of its total liabilities, the sources said.  NCD issuance has exploded in recent years as lenders, especially small ones, use this once loosely-regulated short-term debt instrument to fund longer-term investments, often through shadow banking. Outstanding NCDs exceeded 8 trillion yuan last year, compared with around 3 trillion yuan at the end of 2015, according to Soochow Securities.

          "body": "BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A powerful blizzard battered the U.S. Northeast on Thursday, knocking out power for tens of thousands of people and snarling travel amid a cold snap that has gripped much of the United States for over a week and killed more than a dozen people.  Thousands of flights were canceled, firefighters scrambled to rescue motorists from flooded streets in Boston, National Guard troops were mobilized in the Northeast and New York City\u2019s two main airports halted flights because of whiteout conditions.  \u201cToday, I thought Manhattan was going to have the streets cleaned up, but I see not,\u201d said Valentine Williams, who usually operates an electric scooter to deliver food in New York City.  The snow forced Williams, 28, to make deliveries on foot. No customers complained that he was slower than usual. \u201cThey\u2019re just surprised that I\u2019m out here,\u201d he added.   Officials feared fast-dropping temperatures after the storm passed would turn snow on roadways to ice.  Ahead of that threat, snow plows and salt trucks were dispatched along streets and highways, and schools were closed through much of the region. In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh said schools would remain closed on Friday.   Blizzard warnings were in effect along the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine. The U.S. National Weather Service measured wind gusts of more than 70 miles per hour (113 kph), which downed power lines.  Almost 80,000 homes and businesses in the Northeast and Southeast, where the storm struck on Wednesday, were without power.  The Boston area received 12 inches of snow, with more on the way, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of New Jersey were buried under nearly a foot and a half of powder.  The storm was powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d It brought high winds and swift, heavy snowfall.  The wintry weather has been blamed for at least 14 deaths in the past few days, including four in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas because of the cold.  Nearly 500 members of the National Guard were activated along the East Coast to assist with emergency response, including 200 in New York state, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement.   More than 5,000 U.S. airline flights were canceled. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy (JFK) and LaGuardia airports, all flights were temporarily halted because of whiteout conditions, the Federal Aviation Administration said. LaGuardia on Thursday evening announced on Twitter that the suspension had been lifted. But the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said flights at JFK would not resume until 7 a.m. Friday.   Passenger train operator Amtrak ran reduced service in the Northeast. Sporadic delays were reported on transit systems, including New York\u2019s Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines, as well as the Boston area\u2019s Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority system.  \u201cYears of Band-Aid solutions create nightmare situations when storm damage occurs,\u201d said Joseph Schwieterman, a professor of public policy and specialist in transportation systems at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cReplacement parts are tough to find and maintenance process turns into major headache.\u201d  In New York\u2019s Fort Greene neighborhood, Mohammed Farid Khan said his morning commute took three times as long as usual because of train woes.  \u201cThere were only local trains, no express,\u201d Khan, 30, said as he hunched with an electric drill trying to fix the handle of his snow shovel inside the convenience store where he works.   A 3-foot (0.9-meter) tidal surge flooded the area around Boston\u2019s historic Long Wharf with icy seawater. Firefighters used an inflatable raft to rescue one motorist from a car submerged in water up to its door handles, Boston Fire Commissioner Joseph Finn told reporters.  The flooding tied a 40-year record, the National Weather Service said.  Boston officials briefly thought they would need to a evacuate a shelter near the flooded areas, Walsh said.   Officials reported traffic accidents throughout the Northeast and the storm\u2019s reach extended to eastern Canada.  On Wednesday, the same storm brought historic cities in the Southeastern United States their heaviest snowfall in three decades.

          "body": "* Retail sales up 2.3 pct m/m in November, gain 4.4 pct y/y  * Stats Office estimates sales rose 2.7-3.1 pct in 2017  * Full-year rise is strongest in two years in real terms (Adds details, context)  By Michelle Martin  BERLIN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - German retail sales surged more than expected in November and were estimated to have risen sharply in 2017 overall, data showed on Friday, boosting hopes that private consumption propped up growth in Europe\u2019s biggest economy last year.  Germans revelling in record-high employment, a secure job market, rising wages and low borrowing costs are casting their traditional thriftiness aside to spend more, helping private consumption replace exports as the main growth driver.  Retail sales - a volatile indicator that is often subject to revision - rose by 2.3 percent on the month in real terms, the Federal Statistics Office said. That beat the Reuters consensus forecast for a 1 percent increase and represented a rebound after a 1 percent fall in October.  Sales for the month were 4.4 percent higher in real terms than a year earlier, the data showed, overshooting a Reuters consensus forecast for a 2.5 percent increase.  The Statistics Office estimated that retail sales increased by between 2.7 percent and 3.1 percent in 2017 overall when taking inflation into account. That would be the strongest increase in two years.  In nominal terms, sales growth was estimated to be between 4.5 and 4.9 percent on the year. That would be the biggest increase since records began in 1994.  The government has said economic growth was probably strong in 2017 and it expects household spending to continue rising as incomes and employment keep increasing.  Early indicators suggest retail sales should have a strong start to 2018 too - a survey by market research group GfK in late December showed consumers felt more optimistic heading into January, unperturbed by German political parties\u2019 failure to form a new government.  In addition, negotiated wages for around 17 million German workers climbed by 2.3 percent in 2017 - stronger than inflation - boosting their purchasing power.

          "title": "Toshiba after the Westinghouse sale",
          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - A $4.6 billion deal announced on Thursday to sell bankrupt U.S. nuclear plant maker Westinghouse Electric Co LLC will help its owner Toshiba Corp (6502.T) move a step closer to rebuilding its finances and focusing on smaller but more stable businesses.  The deal, agreed with a subsidiary of Canada\u2019s Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) (BAM.N), adds to a string of recent asset sales by Toshiba and will pave the way for the once-sprawling chips-to-TV conglomerate to become a lean maker of components and machinery.  The deal, coming on the heels of Toshiba\u2019s long-awaited agreement to sell its memory chips business for $18 billion, is due to close in the third quarter, assuming it wins the approval of regulators and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.  Toshiba\u2019s shares rose 2 percent on Friday after briefly reaching a 2 1/2 month high.      Toshiba does not stand to benefit directly from the sale. Proceeds will be divided among Westinghouse creditors which currently include Toshiba, but the Japanese firm plans to sell its Westinghouse-related claims by the end of March.  Analysts, however, said the sale amount was higher than projections, with Macquarie Research\u2019s Damian Thong saying he expected a deal of around $4 billion.   That has raised hopes that Toshiba can secure a good deal on its Westinghouse-related claims. The firm has said selling the claims by March-end would allow it to book a steep loss, thereby securing a major tax benefit that would offset the levy expected on capital gains from the sale of its memory business.  Some analysts said the Westinghouse deal could add fuel to calls from investors for the Japanese conglomerate to reconsider selling its chips business, Toshiba Memory.  Toshiba agreed in late September to sell the unit, the world\u2019s second-biggest producer of NAND chips, to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital LP for $18 billion, to cover billions of dollars in liabilities arising from Westinghouse\u2019s bankruptcy.  Most analysts agree with Toshiba\u2019s view that if it retained the business, it would have difficulty investing enough to keep up with NAND leader Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) while also trying to rebuild its finances.  \u201cTo respond to rapidly growing NAND demand and to keep up with necessary research and development, the memory business requires massive investment,\u201d a Toshiba spokesman said on Friday.  \u201cOur stance is still that the deal with the Bain-led consortium is the best way.\u201d  Toshiba will keep 40.2 percent of Toshiba Memory meaning it will continue to benefit from growth in the chips segment. Other than that, it has few strong profit drivers having sold its lucrative medical business in 2016.  Its remaining business will include maintenance of domestic nuclear facilities, as well as selling elevators, train systems, and light fixtures - all stable businesses with little growth potential.  \u201cWe are waiting to see what kind of growth scenario Toshiba will present after the chip sale,\u201d said a senior executive at one of Toshiba\u2019s creditor banks.  \u201cI just don\u2019t see competitive, market leading businesses among those remaining,\u201d said the executive, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.  Toshiba is also not entirely rid of risk. One concern has been a 20-year contract to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Freeport LNG in the U.S. state of Texas, a deal struck in 2013 as part of a plan to sweeten sales of turbines for power plants.   As Asian gas prices plunge, Toshiba must find more buyers for the LNG or pay a fixed gas processing fee to Freeport of about $370 million per year for the life of the contract, which begins in 2019.

          "title": "Global distressed-debt funds circle China again, eye $256 billion bad-loans market",
          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Global distressed-debt specialists are stepping up their dealmaking in China after a decade, betting that the country is becoming serious about developing a market to tackle its $256 billion of official non-performing loans (NPLs).  Groups such as Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and Bain Capital Credit LP made their first investments in recent months, amid surging write-offs by banks and indications that China\u2019s commercial bad loans market is set to deepen.  Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK.N) last month agreed to buy a portfolio of distressed loans with a face value of 3.1 billion yuan ($476.70 million), its fifth deal, according to Tony Rao, a partner with law firm Alpha & Leader, which helped provide due diligence on the deal.  More overseas cash is set to enter the market in 2018, said Rao, in spite of rising competition with local buyers that has sent average prices above 50 cents on the dollar.   Oaktree declined to comment.  NPLs on commercial bank balance sheets officially amounted to 1.67 trillion yuan ($256.80 billion) at the end of September, or 1.74 percent of all loans. Overdue loans - those not yet technically considered bad - reached 3.4 trillion yuan. Many analysts estimate actual amounts are much higher.   Loan write-offs by commercial lenders, one indication of how deeply banks are cleaning house, jumped 50 per cent to about 1.4 trillion yuan in 2016, according to estimates by UBS analyst Jason Bedford.  An initial wave of foreign interest in China\u2019s bad loans a decade ago, led by big western banks, faded as deals failed to materialize and legal uncertainties multiplied.  But China\u2019s distressed-debt market has become more commercialized since then. Once the monopoly of the Big Four asset management companies established in 1999 to take over bad loans from the country\u2019s biggest lenders, the market today includes at least 55 regional managers while sales channels for bad loans now include online auctions, over-the-counter trades at local asset exchanges as well as NPL securitization.  \u201cThe market has broadened,\u201d said Phil Groves, president of DAC Management LLC, a China-focused alternative investment manager and bad-loan servicing company that was bought by Blackstone last year. \u201cThere\u2019s more to buy, bigger portfolios, and different types of credit available.\u201d  Blackstone acquired its first-ever Chinese commercial loan portfolio for $195 million in August - the same month that Bain Capital Credit did its first-ever deal with the purchase of $200 million in mostly real estate backed loans in the coastal province of Jiangsu.  Bain is now looking at other real estate-backed portfolios and building a loan servicing team to handle future deals, said Kei Chua, Bain\u2019s Hong Kong-based managing director.  Global distressed-debt players said they\u2019re encouraged by ongoing legal and structural changes in China - particularly in coastal regions - that has seen the emergence of professional appraisers and brokers, databases to check asset titles and liens, and greater certainty in the courts.  Foreign investors have for now mostly stuck to real estate deals because that market is better established with easily-valued collateral. Oaktree\u2019s latest portfolio, consisting of 178 loans in China\u2019s Pearl River Delta, is mostly but not entirely property-backed, according to Alpha & Leader\u2019s Rao.     China\u2019s bad loans market is, however, dominated by local distressed funds, many of which set up in the last two years, fund managers and advisers said, which has increased competition and raised NPL prices.   A national industry association set up just two years ago has grown to more than 600 members from 200 initially.   \u201cThere isn\u2019t a national market,\u201d said Deng Yanshan, executive director for investment at Lakeshore Capital, a domestic asset manager which oversees 2.5 billion yuan in funds. \u201cThis is still a localized business that\u2019s based in provinces, counties and cities.\u201d  International firms must also deal with currency controls and related government approvals - creating an execution risk, particularly on timing and hedging costs, that their local rivals do not have to bear.   But Ted Osborn, an NPL specialist partner at PwC in Hong Kong, said the outlook for global distressed asset buyers remains good.    \u201cWhen China gets serious and needs to start selling big chunks of bad loans, foreigners are still the only ones with organized capital to do it.\u201d  Reporting By Matthew Miller; Additional reporting by Engen Tham in Shanghai; Editing by Jennifer Hughes and Muralikumar Anantharaman"

          "body": "(Adds closing price, analysts\u2019 comments)  HANOI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Shares of Vietnam\u2019s HDBank closed higher after a strong market debut on Friday, surging as much as 24 percent in early trade, following a $300 million initial public offering (IPO).  More than 32.2 million shares of the retail bank were traded and closed at 39,600 dong ($1.74) a share on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, Thomson Reuters Eikon data showed. That compared with its Dec. 22 IPO price of 32,000 dong.  The exchange allows a stock to trade within 20 percent of its reference price on its debut, and within 7 percent thereafter. HDBank earlier set a reference price of 33,000 dong for its first trading day, slightly above the IPO price.  Analysts said HDBank\u2019s pricing was higher than some major listed peer lenders that have shown better performance.  \u201cIn comparison to listed (bank) shares, HDBank\u2019s price is high because its size and performance are still modest compared to top listed banks,\u201d said Do Bao Ngoc, a senior analyst at MB Securities in Hanoi.  Nguyen The Minh, a deputy research director at Saigon Securities Incorp, said there were positive catalysts for HDBank shares to continue rising.  \u201cInvestors have positive expectation in the future of the banking sector of Vietnam and in the ecosystem of companies run by Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao,\u201d Minh said, referring to the bank\u2019s vice chairwoman, a billionaire who is also the founder and chairwoman of Vietnam\u2019s largest private airline, Vietjet Aviation JSC.  HDBank, formally Ho Chi Minh City Development Joint Stock Commercial Bank, emerged from the IPO with a valuation of around 32.4 trillion dong ($1.43 billion).  Those bought shares in the IPO included over 76 foreign investors such as Japan\u2019s Credit Saison Co Ltd, Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Vietnam Opportunities Fund.  On Tuesday, HDBank said it expected 2017 pretax profit of 2.4 trillion dong. ($1 = 22,709 dong) (Reporting by Mi Nguyen; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Gopakumar Warrier)"

          "title": "Fitch Publishes Zhongyuan Yuzi's 'A-' IDRs; Rates Bonds 'A-(EXP)'",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, January 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has published China-based Zhongyuan Yuzi Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd.'s (Yuzi) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'A-'. The Outlook is Stable. At the same time, Fitch has assigned Yuzi's proposed US dollar senior unsecured guaranteed notes an expected rating of 'A-(EXP)'. The notes will be issued by Zhongyuan Sincere Investment Co. Ltd, Yuzi's indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, and unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Yuzi. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The proposed notes are rated at the same level as Yuzi's IDR because the direct guarantee structure transfers the ultimate responsibility of payment to Yuzi. The proposed notes will constitute Yuzi's unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations. The final rating on the proposed notes is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS Links to Henan Province: Yuzi's rating is credit linked to, but not equalised with, Fitch's internal assessment of Henan province. This is reflected in Yuzi's 100% government ownership, strong provincial oversight on its financials, and strategic importance of the entity's operations to the entire province. These factors result in a strong likelihood of extraordinary support, if needed. Therefore, Yuzi is classified as a credit-linked public sector entity under Fitch's criteria. Henan's Strong Creditworthiness: Henan's gross regional product ranked fifth among China's provinces in 2016, with a growth rate of 8.1%, outperforming the national average. Henan is a key province under the nation's strategy to develop the Central Plains Economic Region, and thus receives financial and policy support from the central government. We expect the Henan government to maintain satisfactory fiscal performance as it is backed by predictable fiscal transfers. These strengths are mitigated by Henan's moderate level of contingent liabilities. Legal Status Attribute Mid-Range: Yuzi is registered as a state-owned limited liability company under Chinese company law. It is indirectly wholly owned by the Henan provincial government. Exclusive Centralised Financing Platform: Yuzi acts as the government's sole designated centralised financing arm for affordable social housing, urban development and industrial cluster development for Henan province. Yuzi financed the majority of the province's affordable social housing projects. Fitch expects Yuzi to continue performing this role and to expand its debt by 20%-30% per year in the next two to three years, given the large capital expenditure budgeted by the local government. Fitch assesses Yuzi's strategic importance at Stronger. Solid Track Record of Support: Yuzi has received a capital injection and various fiscal subsidies totalling CNY10.4 billion. . Fitch expects government support to continue as Yuzi shoulders an increasing amount of public-service work on behalf of the provincial government. Yuzi's integration is assessed at Mid-range. Control and Oversight Attribute Stronger: Yuzi is wholly owned by the provincial government and its board of directors is appointed by the government. The Provincial Department of Finance approves its operational and financial performance targets and reviews them quarterly. Sufficient Liquidity: As of end-2016, Yuzi had CNY6 billion in unrestricted cash on hand and CNY157 billion in unutilised bank facilities, which was sufficient to cover its short-term debt of CNY14 billion. Yuzi also has easy access to low-cost long-term funding due to its close cooperation with China's policy banks and its established reputation in capital markets. Its strong strategic link with the Henan provincial government and its strategic role in implementing the province's urban development plans could lead to a high level of extraordinary government support, if needed. RATING SENSITIVITIES A stronger or more explicit support commitment from the Henan provincial government may trigger positive rating action on Yuzi. Significantly lower strategic importance, a diluted municipal shareholding or reduced explicit and implicit governmental support could lead to a wider rating gap between Yuzi and our internal credit view of the provincial government. An upgrade of Fitch's internal credit view of Henan province may trigger positive rating action on Yuzi, while weaker fiscal performance or heightened indebtedness of the provincial government could lead Fitch to lower its internal assessment of the province's creditworthiness and trigger a downgrade of Yuzi's ratings. Fitch will monitor both the application of existing and any new central government laws, regulations and directives that will effectively prohibit or restrict support by local and regional governments to government-related entities (GREs) such as Yuzi, which may have a practical impact on the entities' ability to service their debts. Fitch interprets such initiatives as the central government's efforts to disentangle GREs from public-sector balance sheets, address indiscriminate GRE debt growth and encourage greater market discipline. Depending on the degree of certainty and the extent of the prohibitions, the agency will take rating action that could result in a widening of the notching or the adoption of a bottom-up ratings approach, possibly even to the extent of the removal of all support expectations.

          "body": "MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - India\u2019s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) will investigate the failure of authorities to provide a group of enslaved workers with legal and financial support after being rescued, an official said Friday.  Local government officials and rights activists with the National Campaign Committee for Eradication of Bonded Labour (NCCEBD) freed about 100 people last weekend from brick-making factories in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir.  The workers and their families had been trafficked from the state of Chhattisgarh, in central India, and some had been working for as long as 30 years, according to Nirmal Gorana of the NCCEBD.    \u201cThey had not once stepped out of the brick kilns,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a clear case of trafficking for bonded labor.\u201d   Under Indian law, survivors should be provided with release certificates, which are legal documents that entitle them to cash compensation, jobs, land and education for their children.    The NHRC has decided to investigate why officials in the districts of Reasi and Samba - where the workers were - did not issue the papers, said the commission\u2019s registrar, Surajit Dey.  \u201cThey were trafficked workers,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cWe have asked the district magistrates of Reasi and Samba to issue them release certificates.\u201d  Sheetal Nanda, the Samba district magistrate, said there was no evidence that the workers and their families were held against their will.  \u201cThere is no question of a release certificate until the time we can establish it was bonded labor, which would mean they were made to stay by force and their payments were withheld,\u201d she said by telephone.  India banned bonded labor in 1976, but millions of people remain enslaved in fields, brick kilns, rice mills, brothels and private homes. Most are from marginalized Dalit and tribal communities.   In 2016, the government announced plans to rescue more than 18 million bonded laborers by 2030, and to increase compensation for rescued workers by fivefold.  \u201cBut in many cases, officials fail to recognize them as bonded workers and simply send them back to their home state,\u201d said Umi Daniel, a migrant rights activist with Aide et Action in the eastern state of Odisha.  He estimated that only about 10 to 15 percent of those rescued in the last five years were given release certificates.  The workers and their families who were rescued last weekend were taken to Delhi, India\u2019s capital, where they staged protests demanding certificates.

          "body": "* Dollar struggles despite strong ISM, ADP data  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Saikat Chatterjee  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The euro consolidated gains below a four-month high on Friday on some expectations that European policymakers may have to start withdrawing stimulus policies earlier than previously forecasted against the backdrop of a strengthening economy.  With the U.S. dollar failing to draw any strength from this week\u2019s manufacturing and private payrolls data and two U.S. interest rate hikes already baked into market expectations, traders believe there is more upside room for the euro against the greenback.  \u201cCurrency markets broadly know what the Fed is going to do this year but the ECB monetary policy may be the surprise package of 2018,\u201d said Richard Falkenhall, senior FX strategist at SEB in Stockholm.  Money markets expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates two times this year compared to a Fed forecast of three times.  In contrast, markets don\u2019t expect any change in policy interest rates in Europe until 2019 though some of those expectations may have been slightly bought forward in recent days after comments by senior ECB policymakers.  The European Central Bank may end its stimulus programme this year if the euro zone economy continues to grow strongly, ECB rate-setter Ewald Nowotny told a German newspaper.  \u201cMarket participants might bank on the ECB following in the Fed\u2019s footsteps earlier after all if the economic environment improves further, which would be a reason to prefer the euro over the dollar,\u201d Commerzbank strategists said in a note.  On Friday, the euro was broadly steady at $1.2060, just shy of a September 2017 high of $1.2092. A break above that level would take the single currency to its highest level since January 2015.  Weighed down by the greenback\u2019s weakness against the euro, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was poised for a loss of 0.3 percent this week.  It probed a three-month low of 91.751 on Tuesday and last stood at 91.996, headed for its third week of losses.  The U.S. currency\u2019s lack of traction was highlighted overnight as the dollar failed to draw support from stronger-than-expected jobs report. U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, data from ADP Research Institute showed, the biggest monthly increase since March.  Also weighing on the dollar was a renewed flattening of the U.S. yield curve with spreads of ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds over two-year debt falling below 50 basis points to its lowest levels in more than a decade.  The markets are now focused on Friday\u2019s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show job gains of 190,000 for December, and eurozone flash inflation estimates due at 10 GMT.  A Reuters poll expects eurozone inflation of 1.4 percent in December compared to 1.5 percent in November and still below an ECB target of just below 2 percent.

          "title": "Left with \"chocolate water\", Madagascar's parched south grows hungrier",
          "body": "ANKILIBEVAHAVOLA, Madagascar (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Every morning, residents of this village in southern Madagascar\u2019s Amboasary Sud district set off on an eight-hour round-trip journey to collect water from the nearest river.   Along the thirsty way, some give up and instead use plastic jerry cans to scoop up whatever they can find in potholes along the road \u2013 muddy liquid that aid workers jokingly call \u201cchocolate water\u201d.  This region of Madagascar has been chronically poor for decades, but a series of droughts, which government officials say are driven by climate change, have left close to a million people struggling to cope in this southern African island nation.  Drought is increasing the risk of malnutrition and could cause deaths in children younger than five, half of whom already suffer from stunting, Norohasina Rakotoarison, a spokeswoman for Madagascar\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  In the south of the island, where many people farm for a living, the rainy season is getting shorter and shorter, they say. Rains that once stretched from October to March now fall only between December and February.  A recent El Nino event \u2013 a warming of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific that often causes drought in southern Africa \u2013 aggravated already dry conditions, driving hunger not only in Madagascar but across southern Africa.  That El Nino has now ended, but many families have not recovered, and harsh weather continues, they say.  \u201cThe air is more violent. The wind is very strong,\u201d Soja Voalahtsesylvain, the chief of AnkilibeVahavola, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Around the area, \u201cthere\u2019s no production because the land is very dry\u201d.  \u201cIt\u2019s our everyday life now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wait for the rain because our main issue is lack of water. We don\u2019t know when it will come.\u201d  In Madagascar, nine in 10 people live on less than $2 a day, according to Unicef. Poverty is even worse in the dry south. Bumpy roads last paved in colonial days impede the delivery of aid, and mean even emergency transport is difficult.  Hoasie, a woman in her 40s who goes by one name, said she was forced to carry her 3-year-old son 20 kilometers to the nearest hospital in November, after large bumps broke out on his body.  It turned out he was suffering from acute malnutrition and a lack of protein. But the drought makes it difficult to feed him better, she said.  \u201cWe\u2019re farmers, so when there is no rain we have no crops,\u201d she said.  In September, construction began on a much-needed pipeline that will carry clean water much closer to 13 thirsty communities in this area of southern Madagascar.   The pipeline, funded by Madagascar\u2019s Ministry of Water and Unicef and expected to be working by March, will provide household water for about 46,000 people.  \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency to complete this pipeline,\u201d said Heriniaina Rakotomalala, a civil engineer who works with Unicef on the project.  For now, in AnkilibeVahavola, home to about 3,000 people, families are trying to get by using a traditional lending system, in which poor families borrow water or food from neighbors and eventually pay it back when the rains come.  But this year, it\u2019s been more difficult.  \u201cBecause of drought every livelihood has gone,\u201d said Aova Soatoatse, a 43-year-old with 13 children. She said her family are now eating wild cactus plants to provide the bulk of their diet.  Looking for cash to buy food, they sold their wooden shelter and moved into a smaller one \u2013 but the paltry money bought food only sufficient for two days.  \u201cThen the money was finished,\u201d she said. Now they live crammed together into a one-bedroom wooden shack.  At the moment the family still has six chickens. But the small plot of land they own is steadily decreasing in size, as they sell off bits to buy more food.  The family isn\u2019t the only one facing hard times.  \u201cThere\u2019s no food and people are hungry. We only eat cactus seed and fruit. We cook it and boil it with water,\u201d said Rafoava Ravaonimira, 65, another resident of the village.  She said it was hardest to explain to the youngest children why they can only have one meal a day. \u201cThe older the kids grow, the more they understand. They start to understand aged si  Unicef officials say there are 850,000 people in need of humanitarian assistance in Madagascar, including 391,000 children.  Jean-Beno\u00eet Manhes, Unicef\u2019s deputy representative in Madagascar, called the situation a \u201csilent crisis\u201d, which gets little attention because of the island\u2019s lack of geopolitical significance.   \u201c(It\u2019s) a French-speaking island in an English-speaking region. With a (something like a) cyclone you can take nice before and after photos,\u201d he said.  But with drought, \u201cit just gets a little bit dryer each year,\u201d he said.  He said it\u2019s important to understand that climate change is not the only threat to food security. Slash-and-burn agriculture techniques, particularly the burning of forests \u2013 which when left standing can stabilize rainfall \u2013 also are playing a role, he said.  \u201cThere\u2019s climate change, but human action reinforces it. In the south they burn forests for charcoal and agriculture. That reinforces climate change,\u201d he said.  Meanwhile, many families in the impoverished south with large families are faced with a hard decision: which of their children to feed.   \u201cFamilies may prioritize giving food to the children who can work to help, leaving less to the smallest children who are already malnourished,\u201d Manhes said.

          "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore on Friday fined five electronics parts makers a total of S$19.5 million ($14.7 million) for price-fixing and other cartel activities, the biggest anti-competition penalty in the city-state, the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) said.    The firms colluded to fix sales prices of Aluminium Electrolytic Capacitors (AEC) and exchange confidential and sensitive industry information dating back to 1997, the agency said in a statement.   The firms are Panasonic Industrial Devices Singapore and Panasonic Industrial Devices Malaysia, Rubycon Singapore, Singapore Chemi-con (SCC), Nichicon Singapore, and ELNA Electronics.  AECs are electrical parts used in a range of products including computers, car engines and various home appliances. The five firms accounted for more than two-thirds of Singapore\u2019s  AEC market share, CCS said.   The close competitors held regular meetings attended by their senior-level employees on a monthly basis up until 2013, the CCS said in the statement.   \u201cThe fact that the parties held more than two-thirds of the share of the market for the sale of AECs in Singapore, the long duration of the cartel conduct further contributed to CCS imposing the highest financial penalty to date,\u201d it said.   All the firms except Nichicon applied for leniency and had their fines reduced. Panasonic received total immunity from financial penalties for coming forward, a move that initiated the probe, CCS said.  In July last year, Nichicon pleaded guilty to fixing the prices of electrolytic capacitors sold in the United States and elsewhere and agreed to pay a $42-million fine.  Rubycon and ELNA have also been under investigation for price-fixing for AECs in the United States.   Similar investigations involving AECs are also ongoing in China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and in the European Union.   Reporting by Fathin Ungku; Editing by Jack Kim and Sunil Nair"

Founded in 2015, Chushou is an online e-sports platform where users can live stream their mobile phone games. The service has roughly 8 million streamers and 250,000 live streams a day, said the companies in a statement on Friday.   Google will help the Chinese firm expand its services to target more overseas viewers, it said.   Live stream gaming platforms are a popular form of e-sports in China, part of a growing industry that involves competitive game play viewed by spectators. Google\u2019s YouTube launched a specialized service for live stream gamers in 2015, capturing a large chunk of the global market.  The companies did not reveal the size of Google\u2019s stake or the valuation of Chushou after the round.  It is Google\u2019s second investment in a Chinese startup in recent years, as the search engine giant looks for new avenues into the Chinese market where its flagship search engine has been blocked by censorship authorities since 2012.   The U.S. firm took a minority stake in Beijing-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup Mobvoi in 2015 as part of a $75 million fundraising round. (reut.rs/2CtlBsy)  Google\u2019s inability to access China\u2019s large population of young, tech-savvy internet users poses a challenge for the firm whose search engine has expanded to become the world\u2019s largest and most ubiquitous.   Last year the firm began targeting China as a potential market to expand its AI offerings. In December, it launched an artificial intelligence lab in China, and in May it held a Go match between its AI project Alpha Go and Chinese Go champion Ke Jie. The match was highly publicized in international media but was not widely covered in local media.  Last month, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai also spoke at a high-profile event in China organized by the Cyberspace Administration of China, which oversees internet censorship in the country.  \u201cChushou has built an impressive platform, with a dedicated and quickly growing base of content creators and consumers, and smart expansion plans,\u201d said Frank Lin, who oversees corporate development for Google in North Asia, in the statement.  Google said it joins existing investors Qiming Venture, Shunwei Capital and Alpha X Capital in the latest round.

The U.S. firm took a minority stake in Beijing-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup Mobvoi in 2015 as part of a $75 million fundraising round. (reut.rs/2CtlBsy)  Google\u2019s inability to access China\u2019s large population of young, tech-savvy internet users poses a challenge for the firm whose search engine has expanded to become the world\u2019s largest and most ubiquitous.   Last year the firm began targeting China as a potential market to expand its AI offerings. In December, it launched an artificial intelligence lab in China, and in May it held a Go match between its AI project Alpha Go and Chinese Go champion Ke Jie. The match was highly publicized in international media but was not widely covered in local media.  Last month, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai also spoke at a high-profile event in China organized by the Cyberspace Administration of China, which oversees internet censorship in the country.  \u201cChushou has built an impressive platform, with a dedicated and quickly growing base of content creators and consumers, and smart expansion plans,\u201d said Frank Lin, who oversees corporate development for Google in North Asia, in the statement.  Google said it joins existing investors Qiming Venture, Shunwei Capital and Alpha X Capital in the latest round.

Farage, who as UKIP leader convinced Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s predecessor, David Cameron, to call the Brexit referendum and then helped lead the campaign for Brexit, has repeatedly scolded May for being too weak in the EU divorce talks.  He said in a video clip posted on Twitter that he would meet the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday and appealed for people to send him their questions to put to Barnier.  \u201cI thought who is in there representing the views of the 17.4 million people?

Its going to happen.\u201d  In the United Kingdom\u2019s 2016 referendum, 51.9 percent, or 17.4 million people, voted to leave the EU while 48.1 percent, or 16.1 million people, voted to stay.  May has said Britain will leave the EU on March 29 at 2300GMT. The EU and Britain are discussing the terms of the divorce.  Farage, 53, casts the EU as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending.  He has dismissed speculation from opponents of Brexit such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair that voters might change their mind about leaving the EU.  \u201cThe revolution of 2016 is still rolling,\u201d he told Reuters in November. \u201cThe European Union project is in deep trouble and it\u2019s only a matter of time until it ends.\u201d  Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Costas Pitas"

The Angels won a heated race late last year to sign the 23-year-old, who was an accomplished pitcher and batter for his former club, the Hokkaido Nippon Ham-Fighters.  Ohtani was at Kamagaya Stadium, an hour\u2019s drive from Tokyo, on Friday, taking practice swings and doing some light running as fans looked on.  \u201cI think for all teams, including the Angels, it\u2019s a major goal to win the World Series,\u201d Ohtani told reporters.  \u201cI want to begin practising now with the hopes of helping the team get closer to that goal.\u201d  Ohtani, who pitches right-handed, had a 2.52 earned run average (ERA) in five seasons with the Ham-Fighters.

          "body": "KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber in the Afghan capital caused dozens of casualties on Thursday after blowing himself up close to a group of security personnel who were carrying out an operation against illegal drugs and alcohol dealing, officials said.  Islamic State, which has claimed a series of attacks in Kabul over the past two years, issued a statement on its Amaq news agency saying it was responsible.  It said a suicide bomber targeting a group of police and intelligence service personnel had detonated an explosive vest, killing or wounding around 80 of them.  Wahid Majroh, a spokesman for the ministry of public health, said 11 dead and 25 wounded had been brought to city hospitals after the blast in an area of the city not far from the U.S. Embassy and other foreign missions.  As security forces arrived, a Reuters reporter saw four police vehicles carrying dead or wounded security personnel from the scene.  Police officers at the scene said the bomber had been wearing police or army uniform and had approached a group of security personnel conducting controls on illegal drugs and alcohol sellers, but there was no official confirmation.  \u201cKabul police forces were there to prevent a possible protest when a suicide bomber approached them and detonated his suicide vest,\u201d Kabul police spokesman Bashir Mujahid said.  While Afghan forces backed by U.S. air strikes have claimed some success against Taliban insurgents since the United States announced a stepped up military strategy last year, high profile attacks on civilian targets in Kabul have continued.  The attack happened days after a suicide bomber killed at least 41 people and wounded more than 80 at a Shi\u2019ite cultural center in Kabul, underlining the precarious security situation in the Afghan capital.  That attack was also claimed by Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for a number of similar attacks in Afghanistan over the past two years.

The Dec. 23 blaze in Davao City, the southern hometown of President Rodrigo Duterte, broke out on the third level of a mall before its choking smoke engulfed the offices of the U.S. firm, Research Now SSI, a floor above.  Five members of the Davao City fire department, who had inspected the mall and issued permits for it to operate, were relieved of duties and face administrative investigation.  Initial checks by the Bureau of Fire Protection revealed signs of fire safety lapses that may have contributed to the tragedy, since there were problems with \u201cexits, sprinkler systems and alarm systems\u201d.  \u201cWe are calling for an investigation in aid of legislation,\u201d Congresswoman Arlene Brosas of Gabriela, a women\u2019s group, told a news conference.   \u201cWe are filing a resolution as soon as the session starts. We will call anew the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Standards (bill).\u201d  The lower house of Congress will resume its session on Jan. 15.  The left-wing bloc will seek to ensure the accountability of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, the Labour Department, the Davao City government and companies involved, Brosas said.  A security officer of the New City Commercial Center shopping mall was among the 38 killed in the fire, which injured six people, although about 100 call center employees survived.  SSI has declined to comment on the issue of fire safety at its Davao offices until the investigation is completed.  The Research Now SSI offices in Davao employ 500 people. It promised to relocate some to a bigger facility in the central Philippines while looking for a new site in the south.  On its website, SSI says it has more than 11 million panelists in 40 countries with more than 300 clients worldwide, including Twitter, Facebook, Nielsen, Capital One, BestBuy and Liberty Mutual.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc co-founder Travis Kalanick, who was ousted as chief executive in June, is selling nearly a third of his 10 percent stake in the ride-services company for about $1.4 billion, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  Kalanick\u2019s sale is part of a deal struck by a consortium led by SoftBank Group Corp which is taking a 17.5 percent stake in Uber, mostly by buying shares from early investors and employees. SoftBank last week secured agreements from shareholders who were willing to sell, and the deal will close early this year, Uber said.  The SoftBank deal values Uber at $48 billion, about a 30 percent discount from its most recent valuation of $68 billion. However, the investor consortium is also making a $1.25 billion investment of fresh funding at the older, higher valuation.  Kalanick had offered to sell half of his total shares, but because there was a limit on how much SoftBank will buy, he will sell just 29 percent, according to the source. Other investors also did not get to unload as many shares as they had hoped because of such widespread interest to sell.  The former CEO owns 10 percent of the company, which means his sale will unload 2.9 percent of Uber shares and earn him about $1.4 billion, the source added.   A spokesman for Kalanick declined to comment. SoftBank and Uber could not be reached immediately for comment.  The sale would make the Uber co-founder a billionaire for the first time, not just on paper. Kalanick has never before sold shares of the company he ran for almost a decade, the source said.  The SoftBank deal offers investors and employees what could be their last chance to sell shares in a company-approved transaction before Uber\u2019s long awaited initial public offering, planned for 2019.     The transaction marks a victory for new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who helped broker the deal and who will benefit from a deep-pocketed investor like SoftBank.  Bloomberg first reported Kalanick\u2019s plans to sell part of his stake.  Reporting by Liana B.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain should charge a 25-pence ($0.34) levy on disposable coffee cups to cut down waste and use the money to improve recycling facilities, a committee of lawmakers said on Friday.  Chains Pret A Manger, Costa Coffee, Caffe Nero and Greggs alongside U.S. firm Starbucks are among the biggest coffee-sellers in Britain, rapidly expanding in the last 10 years to meet increasing demand.  Although some outlets give a discount to customers using their own cup, only 1-2 percent of buyers take up the offer, according to parliament\u2019s environmental audit committee which said a \u201clatte levy\u201d was needed instead.  \u201cThe UK throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year; enough to circle the planet five and a half times,\u201d said Chair of the committee, Mary Creagh.  \u201cWe\u2019re calling for action to reduce the number of single use cups, promote reusable cups over disposable cups and to recycle all coffee cups by 2023,\u201d she said.  The committee said that if the recycling target is not met then disposable coffee cups should be banned.  In October 2015, Britain introduced a charge of 5p on all single-use plastic bags provided by large shops, which led to an 83 percent reduction in UK plastic bags used in the first year.  On Friday the environment ministry said the government was working closely with the sector and had made progress in increasing recycling rates.  \u201cWe are encouraged by industry action to increase the recycling of paper cups with some major retail chains now offering discounts to customers with reusable cups,\u201d said a spokeswoman.  \u201cWe will carefully consider the committee\u2019s recommendations and respond shortly,\u201d she said.  $1 = 0.7377 pounds\nReporting by Costas Pitas; editing by Kate Holton"

          "title": "Fitch Downgrades Sunshine Holdings to 'A-(lka)'; Outlook Stable",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) COLOMBO, January 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka-based Sunshine Holdings PLC's National Long-Term Rating to 'A-(lka)' from 'A(lka)'. The Outlook is Stable. The downgrade reflects Fitch's expectations that Sunshine's net leverage - defined as lease-adjusted debt net of cash/operating EBITDAR, including proportionate  consolidation  of  Estate Management Services (Private) Limited (EMSPL), the  holding  company  for  the  agriculture and consumer goods segments - will remain higher than the level commensurate with a higher rating over the next three years. The higher leverage is due to the substantial increase in debt following Sunshine's acquisition of an additional stake in EMSPL from Tata Global Beverages for LKR2.9 billion on 28 December 2017. The acquisition will increase Sunshine's ownership of EMSPL to 60.0%, from 33.2%, and improve the fungibility of group cash flow. We expect operating cash flow from the group's palm-oil segment, a part of EMSPL, to improve in the medium-term, but this is unlikely to be sufficient to offset the higher debt. KEY RATING DRIVERS Higher Financial Risk: Sunshine's financial profile has weakened, as the acquisition has added LKR2.7 billion of additional debt. Fitch expects net leverage to increase to 2.5x in the financial year ending March 2018 (FY18), then modestly recover to around 2.3x through FY21, buoyed by a rising EBITDA contribution from the palm-oil business. We also believe Sunshine's structural subordination risk is heightened, as the holding company borrowed LKR1.4 billion for the share purchase, while its cash flow is dependent on dividend payments from subsidiaries. However, this is mitigated by Sunshine's increased control of EMSPL and better group fungibility of operating cash flow. Increasing Cash Flow Volatility: The EMSPL acquisition increases Sunshine's exposure to the agriculture business, which generates more volatile cash flow relative to Sunshine's comparatively defensive healthcare segment. We also believe that the long-term viability of Sunshine's tea-plantation segment is inhibited by unstable export demand, lower productivity and an escalating cost structure. However, this is mitigated by the rising cash flow contribution from the company's profitable palm-oil business, which contributed 71% of agri-segment EBITDA in FY17. Palm Oil Supports Profitability: We expect the palm-oil segment to be a key contributor to higher operating cash flow in the medium term, based on our forecast for global palm-oil prices to average USD665/tonne in 2018 and USD675/tonne from 2019. Sunshine is Sri Lanka's largest palm-oil producer, accounting for more than half of domestic output, and is well-positioned to benefit from rising local demand, increased near-term capacity and the government's protectionist import tariffs. Palm oil is the largest contributor to Sunshine's profitability, accounting for 36% of group proportionate EBITDA in FY17 (FY16: 24%). The government cut import taxes on edible oil by around 20% in November 2017 to make up for lower domestic supply volume due to adverse weather conditions. This is likely to cause a slight short-term dip in Sunshine's palm-oil margins, but we expect margins to recover in the medium-term as taxes revert to historical levels with improvements in supply. Margin Pressure in Branded Tea: The EBITDA margin of Sunshine's branded-tea segment weakened by 660bp to 8.9% in FY17, due to higher tea prices in the Colombo Tea Auction over the previous 12-14 months. Intense price competition, particularly in the lower -end of the market, also limits Sunshine's ability to fully pass on cost increases to customers. Nevertheless, we expect tea costs to moderate with easing supply-side pressure, which should benefit the segment's margin. Sunshine's strategy to tap the higher-growth hotel, restaurant and catering industries should also support the segment's top-line and profitability growth. Long-Term Benefits from Investments: Fitch expects capacity expansion in Sunshine's power and dairy segments to stabilise cash flow in the long term by reducing the contribution share from the volatile tea and palm-oil businesses. We estimate the EBITDA contribution from the power and dairy segments to exceed LKR190 million by FYE19, once the increased capacity goes into operation. DERIVATION SUMMARY Sunshine's rating compares well against that of Richard Pieris & Company PLC (RICH, A(lka)/Stable). RICH is rated one-notch higher due to its stronger business risk profile from a lower exposure to the cyclical plantation segment compared with Sunshine, as well as substantially higher cash flow from its defensive grocery retail business and larger operating scale. Both companies have similar financial risk due to Sunshine's latest acquisition. Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC (A-(lka)/Stable) is a leading consumer durables retailer that has a stronger business-risk profile than Sunshine and a significantly larger operating scale, despite greater operating cash flow volatility. However, this is offset by Singer's much higher leverage, which results in both companies having the same rating. DSI Samson Group (Private) Limited (DSG, BBB+(lka)/Stable) is the market leader in the domestic rubber tyre and footwear markets and has a business-risk profile similar to that of Sunshine. However, DSG is rated one notch below Sunshine due its significantly higher leverage. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Sunshine include: - Revenue growth to slow in FY18 to low-single-digit levels (FY17: 10.3%) due to price controls in the pharmaceutical segment, and to recover gradually to mid-single digits over the next two years. Recovery will be driven by the expanding palm-oil business, Fitch's expected rebound in pharmaceuticals and a rising contribution from the diagnostics and healthcare retail segments - EBITDAR margins to be maintained in the low-double-digit range over FY18-FY21 (FY17: 14.2%), despite challenges faced by the pharmaceutical and tea plantation segments - Capex of LKR4.5 billion over FY18-FY21 for expansion across the board - Sunshine to maintain its dividend policy RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - An increase in Sunshine's lease-adjusted debt net of cash/EBITDAR (including proportionate consolidation of EMSPL) over 3.0x for a sustained period - Sunshine's EBITDAR coverage of gross interest + rent (including proportionate consolidation of EMSPL) falling below 2.0x for a sustained period - Adverse impact on growth and profitability arising from sustained regulatory pressure in the healthcare and agriculture segments Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - A sustained reduction in Sunshine's lease-adjusted debt net of cash/EBITDAR (including proportionate consolidation of EMSPL) below 1.5x LIQUIDITY Satisfactory Liquidity: Sunshine had LKR2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and LKR2.8 billion in unutilised credit facilities as at end-September 2017 to meet LKR1.8 billion of contractual maturities falling due in the next 12 months. This places Sunshine in a comfortable liquidity position that is adequate to meet the company's FY18 capex and dividend payout requirements.

Fitch's National ratings provide a relative measure of creditworthiness for rated entities in countries with relatively low international sovereign ratings and where there is demand for such ratings. The best risk within a country is rated 'AAA' and other credits are rated only relative to this risk. National ratings are designed for use mainly by local investors in local markets and are signified by the addition of an identifier for the country concerned, such as 'AAA(lka)' for National ratings in Sri Lanka.

          "title": "RPT-COLUMN-Banks rake in record fees to beat trading blues: McGeever",
          "body": "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)  By Jamie McGeever  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - By one measure, 2017 was the most lucrative year in history for investment banks.  The fees they charged companies and other financial firms for advising on mergers and acquisitions, arranging loans, and underwriting sales of bonds and stocks reached $104 billion, according to Reuters data.  That was up 16 percent on the previous year and the highest annual total for investment banking fees since Reuters started tracking the data in 2000.  This is noteworthy in itself, but especially so in light of what\u2019s happening to investment banks\u2019 primary source of revenue: trading.  Rapid technological change, automated trading, tighter regulation that limits banks\u2019 capacity to hold fixed income inventory on their books, and record low market volatility have conspired to reduce trading revenue in recent years.  According to industry data provider Coalition, the top 12 investment banks pulled in $119 billion from bond, currency, commodities and equity trading in 2016, the last full year for which figures are available. That\u2019s down nearly 15 percent from $140 billion in 2012.  Trading accounted for revenues of $61.1 billion in the first half of 2017, Coalition figures show. As the bulk of trading activity is conducted in the first six months of any year, it looks like the 2017 total will be the lowest in years.  Most of the decline is in fixed income, currency and commodities \u2014 or FICC \u2014 trading, where regulation has been tightened most and where banks have pulled back most. Equity trading is holding up better but remains a far smaller share of banks\u2019 trading pie than FICC.  The new year is only a few days old but there is no sign of a pick-up in market volatility, a prerequisite for a rebound in trading activity and revenue.  The VIX index of implied volatility on Wall Street has traded below 9 percent on only seven days since its launch nearly 30 years ago. Six have been in the last six months, and two of them have been this week.  Even though the Fed is raising U.S. interest rates and other central banks are gradually turning off the stimulus taps, currency and bond market volatility remains anchored near historic lows too.  In a world of weak trading, equity capital market (ECM) and debt capital market (DCM) activity is commanding a greater share of big banks\u2019 revenues and profits with every passing year.  A bumper 2017 was always likely given that last year saw a high number and value of deals across equity and debt markets, the lowest stock and bond volatility on record, and dozens of new highs for global stock markets.  Even still, it was a remarkable year for fees. The record $104 billion was comprised of $28.1 billion from M&A advisory services, $31.3 bln from DCM activity, $22.4 bln from ECM underwriting and $22.2 bln from syndicating loans.  ECM fees leapt 42 percent to a three-year high of $22.4 billion. As a share of overall ECM activity that was 2.9 percent, according to Reuters calculations \u2014 the highest in at least a decade and well up from 2.1 percent in 2016.  The surge in ECM fees far outstripped the rise in ECM activity and transaction value.  Companies raised $783.7 billion in equity during 2017, up 18 percent from the previous year and the strongest annual period for global ECM issuance in two years. The 5,735 ECM offerings during the year marked a rise of 21 percent over 2016 and was the strongest full-year period since records began in 1980, the Reuters data showed.  DCM fees rose 15 percent to a new record $31.3 billion. Always tiny compared to overall DCM transactions, they rose to 0.4 percent of the value of transactions from 0.3 percent in 2016, according to Reuters calculations.  Again, the rise in fees wasn\u2019t matched by changes in the value or number of transactions. The number of debt issues globally rose 11 percent to 23,321, a new record for a calendar year while DCM activity actually slipped to $7.2 trillion, although that was the second consecutive year above $7 trillion.

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc will release a patch for the Safari web browser on its iPhones, iPads and Macs within days, it said on Thursday, after major chipmakers disclosed flaws that leave nearly every modern computing device vulnerable to hackers.  Browser makers Google, Microsoft Corp and Mozilla Corp\u2019s Firefox all confirmed to Reuters that the patches they currently have in place do not protect iOS users. With Safari and virtually all other popular browsers not patched, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users may have no secure means of browsing the web until Apple issues its patch.  Apple stressed that there were no known instances of hackers taking advantage of the flaw to date.  On Wednesday, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and other security researchers disclosed two major chip flaws, one called Meltdown affecting only Intel Corp chips and one called Spectre affecting nearly all computer chips made in the last decade. The news sparked a sell-off in Intel\u2019s stock as investors tried to gauge the costs to the chipmaker.  In a statement on its website, Apple said all Mac and iOS devices were affected by both Meltdown and Spectre. But the most recent operating system updates for Mac computers, Apple TVs, iPhones and iPads protect users against the Meltdown attack and do not slow down the devices, it added, and Meltdown does not affect the Apple Watch.  Macs and iOS devices are vulnerable to Spectre attacks through code that can run in web browsers. Apple said it would issue a patch to its Safari web browser for those devices \u201cin the coming days.\u201d  Shortly after the researchers disclosed the chip flaws on Wednesday, Google and Microsoft released statements telling users which of their products were affected. Google said its users of Android phones - more than 80 percent of the global market - were protected if they had the latest security updates.      Apple remained silent for more than a day about the fate of the hundreds of millions of users of its iPhones and iPads. Ben Johnson, co-founder and chief strategist for cyber security firm Carbon Black, said the delay in updating customers about whether Apple\u2019s devices are at risk could affect Apple\u2019s drive to get more business customers to adopt its hardware.      \u201cSomething this severe gets the attention of all the employees and executives at a company, and when they go asking the IT and security people about it and security doesn\u2019t have an answer for iPhones and iPads, it just doesn\u2019t give a whole lot of confidence,\u201d Johnson said.

Siggi\u2019s with the tagline \u201csimple ingredients, not a lot of sugar,\u201d has tapped into a shift by consumers toward healthier eating. Its yogurts are at least 25 percent less sugary than leading flavored yogurts, according to its website.  Lactalis said the deal \u201cfurther expands our yogurt platform in the U.S. with this unique and fast-growing yogurt brand.\u201d  After moving to New York from Iceland, siggi\u2019s founder Siggi Hilmarsson felt American yogurt was too sweet and artificial for his liking. He felt homesick for skyr, a sweet Icelandic yoghurt/curd concoction.  Based on a recipe sent by his mother, Siggi began making skyr and went on to establish his own company in 2005 to sell it in the United States.   Siggi\u2019s products are available at Whole Foods, Publix, Target (TGT.N), Wegmans and Starbucks (SBUX.O) stores.  Siggi\u2019s will continue to operate from its New York City office and remain a standalone company under the leadership of Hilmarsson, Lactalis said in a statement.  \u201cOur core values of clean ingredient label and less sugar will remain 100 percent unchanged.

          "title": "Left with \"chocolate water\", Madagascar's parched south grows hungrier",
          "body": "ANKILIBEVAHAVOLA, Madagascar (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Every morning, residents of this village in southern Madagascar\u2019s Amboasary Sud district set off on an eight-hour round-trip journey to collect water from the nearest river.   Along the thirsty way, some give up and instead use plastic jerry cans to scoop up whatever they can find in potholes along the road \u2013 muddy liquid that aid workers jokingly call \u201cchocolate water\u201d.  This region of Madagascar has been chronically poor for decades, but a series of droughts, which government officials say are driven by climate change, have left close to a million people struggling to cope in this southern African island nation.  Drought is increasing the risk of malnutrition and could cause deaths in children younger than five, half of whom already suffer from stunting, Norohasina Rakotoarison, a spokeswoman for Madagascar\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  In the south of the island, where many people farm for a living, the rainy season is getting shorter and shorter, they say. Rains that once stretched from October to March now fall only between December and February.  A recent El Nino event \u2013 a warming of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific that often causes drought in southern Africa \u2013 aggravated already dry conditions, driving hunger not only in Madagascar but across southern Africa.  That El Nino has now ended, but many families have not recovered, and harsh weather continues, they say.  \u201cThe air is more violent. The wind is very strong,\u201d Soja Voalahtsesylvain, the chief of AnkilibeVahavola, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Around the area, \u201cthere\u2019s no production because the land is very dry\u201d.  \u201cIt\u2019s our everyday life now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wait for the rain because our main issue is lack of water. We don\u2019t know when it will come.\u201d  In Madagascar, nine in 10 people live on less than $2 a day, according to Unicef. Poverty is even worse in the dry south. Bumpy roads last paved in colonial days impede the delivery of aid, and mean even emergency transport is difficult.  Hoasie, a woman in her 40s who goes by one name, said she was forced to carry her 3-year-old son 20 kilometers to the nearest hospital in November, after large bumps broke out on his body.  It turned out he was suffering from acute malnutrition and a lack of protein. But the drought makes it difficult to feed him better, she said.  \u201cWe\u2019re farmers, so when there is no rain we have no crops,\u201d she said.  In September, construction began on a much-needed pipeline that will carry clean water much closer to 13 thirsty communities in this area of southern Madagascar.   The pipeline, funded by Madagascar\u2019s Ministry of Water and Unicef and expected to be working by March, will provide household water for about 46,000 people.  \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency to complete this pipeline,\u201d said Heriniaina Rakotomalala, a civil engineer who works with Unicef on the project.  For now, in AnkilibeVahavola, home to about 3,000 people, families are trying to get by using a traditional lending system, in which poor families borrow water or food from neighbors and eventually pay it back when the rains come.  But this year, it\u2019s been more difficult.  \u201cBecause of drought every livelihood has gone,\u201d said Aova Soatoatse, a 43-year-old with 13 children. She said her family are now eating wild cactus plants to provide the bulk of their diet.  Looking for cash to buy food, they sold their wooden shelter and moved into a smaller one \u2013 but the paltry money bought food only sufficient for two days.  \u201cThen the money was finished,\u201d she said. Now they live crammed together into a one-bedroom wooden shack.  At the moment the family still has six chickens. But the small plot of land they own is steadily decreasing in size, as they sell off bits to buy more food.  The family isn\u2019t the only one facing hard times.  \u201cThere\u2019s no food and people are hungry. We only eat cactus seed and fruit. We cook it and boil it with water,\u201d said Rafoava Ravaonimira, 65, another resident of the village.  She said it was hardest to explain to the youngest children why they can only have one meal a day. \u201cThe older the kids grow, the more they understand. They start to understand aged si  Unicef officials say there are 850,000 people in need of humanitarian assistance in Madagascar, including 391,000 children.  Jean-Beno\u00eet Manhes, Unicef\u2019s deputy representative in Madagascar, called the situation a \u201csilent crisis\u201d, which gets little attention because of the island\u2019s lack of geopolitical significance.   \u201c(It\u2019s) a French-speaking island in an English-speaking region. With a (something like a) cyclone you can take nice before and after photos,\u201d he said.  But with drought, \u201cit just gets a little bit dryer each year,\u201d he said.  He said it\u2019s important to understand that climate change is not the only threat to food security. Slash-and-burn agriculture techniques, particularly the burning of forests \u2013 which when left standing can stabilize rainfall \u2013 also are playing a role, he said.  \u201cThere\u2019s climate change, but human action reinforces it. In the south they burn forests for charcoal and agriculture. That reinforces climate change,\u201d he said.  Meanwhile, many families in the impoverished south with large families are faced with a hard decision: which of their children to feed.   \u201cFamilies may prioritize giving food to the children who can work to help, leaving less to the smallest children who are already malnourished,\u201d Manhes said.

Heavy snowfall has wreaked havoc in central and eastern China since Tuesday, killing 10 people and disrupting the lives of more than half a million people in five provinces, according to the official Xinhua news agency.   Agriculture has also been hit, with economic losses amounting to 510 million yuan ($79 million) so far.   The National Meteorological Centre lifted a blizzard alert, but said light to moderate snowfall was expected to sweep across much of the north between Friday and Sunday.    Snow has disrupted public transport and energy supplies, damaged power lines and shut roads, airports and schools in parts of central China.     All power in Suizhou, a small city of 2.5 million people in the north of central Hubei province, was down due to heavy snow, state broadcaster China Central Television reported.   Temperatures in Suizhou are expected to plunge as low as minus 5 degrees Celsius (23 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday.   Hubei, which does not have central heating infrastructure unlike northern provinces, has seen a spike in electricity consumption for heating, according to CCTV.   On Thursday, at least three airports were shut and nine were experiencing extensive delays because of heavy snowfall.  As of 0630 GMT on Friday, all airports in China were open, and only three airports faced delays, according to Chinese aviation data provider VariFlight.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) said fixes for security issues in its microchips would not slow down computers, rebuffing concerns that the flaws found in microprocessors would significantly reduce performance.  The performance impact of the recent security updates should not be significant and will be mitigated over time, Intel said late on Thursday, adding that Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported little to no performance impact from the security updates. intel.ly/2CHQ89E  Intel shares fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday as investors were worried about the potential financial liability and reputational damage from the recently disclosed security issues.  The largest chipmaker confirmed earlier this week that the security issues reported by researchers in the company\u2019s widely used microprocessors could allow hackers to steal sensitive information from computers, phones and other devices.   Security researchers had disclosed two security flaws exposing vulnerability of nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and ARM Holdings.  The first, called Meltdown, affects Intel chips and lets hackers bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer\u2019s memory, potentially letting hackers read a computer\u2019s memory and steal passwords. The second, called Spectre, affects chips from Intel, AMD and ARM and lets hackers potentially trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information.  Intel had said the issues were not caused by a design flaw and asked users to download a patch and update their operating system.  Intel may be on the hook for costs stemming from lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers will likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make, security experts said.

          "body": "HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Talks have been called off between HNA Group and Value Partners Group (0806.HK) over the Chinese conglomerate\u2019s purchase of a stake in the Hong Kong-listed asset manager, people familiar with the situation said.  The dropped deal comes as HNA faces financing strains following $50 billion of acquisitions over the past two years which have sparked scrutiny of its opaque ownership and use of leverage.  Talks between HNA and Value Partners\u2019 two founders, Cheah Cheng Hye and V-Nee Yeh, began last May, according to a stock exchange filing by the Hong Kong company. The fund manager did not disclose the size of the stake proposed to be sold.    Neither that filing, nor one announcing the talks\u2019 end on Thursday, named HNA but people familiar with the matter confirmed the talks were with the Chinese conglomerate.  Cheah and Yeh own 19.2 percent between them. Cheah Company Ltd, a family trust, owns an additional 21.80 percent stake in Value Partners. The combined 41 percent stake was worth $820 million at market close on Thursday.  A stake in Value Partners, among Asia\u2019s largest independent asset managers, was one of series of equity deals in financial groups being pursued by HNA as it looks to expand beyond its base in airlines, tourism and logistics.   The ending of talks was \u201csolely a result of the parties\u2019 commercial consideration in respect of the possible transaction\u201d, Value Partners said in its exchange filing on Thursday. It did not elaborate.   Shares in Value Partners were down 3.9 percent at 0604 GMT, while the Hang Seng index .HSI was 0.1 percent lower.   Prices of HNA\u2019s bonds were unchanged, while bond traders said HNA\u2019s need to roll over its existing financing would have made any deal difficult to finance.  \u201cOur base case assumption was this deal would not go through,\u201d said a bond trader at a U.S. bank. \u201cAny fresh financing is not a wise move for them as they have to go to the same banks they need to go to for rolling over.\u201d  Value Partners and HNA declined to comment.  HNA last year started a push into financial services, buying large minority stakes in the U.S. operations of Old Mutual Asset Management and also in Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE).  It also bought New Zealand\u2019s largest non-banking lender, UDC Finance, and a controlling interest in hedge fund platform SkyBridge Capital in the United States.  New Zealand\u2019s regulator blocked the UDC deal last month and the SkyBridge deal has not yet closed.  In November the conglomerate also suffered a downgrade in its creditworthiness, as measured by S&P Global Ratings, as a result of its \u201caggressive financial policy\u201d.  An HNA executive told Reuters in December that the conglomerate was not facing a liquidity crisis and characterized its high-profile investments - such as Deutsche Bank and hotels group Hilton (HLT.N) - as successful.  Financial services accounted for about 17 percent of the group\u2019s operating revenue of 183 billion yuan ($28.22 billion), and more than 40 percent of gross profit in 2016, led by its financial leasing operations, an HNA Group bond filing shows.

          "title": "Chinese conglomerate HNA's bid to buy stake in HK fund manager fails: sources",
          "body": "HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Talks have been called off between HNA Group and Value Partners Group (0806.HK) over the Chinese conglomerate\u2019s purchase of a stake in the Hong Kong-listed asset manager, people familiar with the situation said.  The dropped deal comes as HNA faces financing strains following $50 billion of acquisitions over the past two years which have sparked scrutiny of its opaque ownership and use of leverage.  Talks between HNA and Value Partners\u2019 two founders, Cheah Cheng Hye and V-Nee Yeh, began last May, according to a stock exchange filing by the Hong Kong company. The fund manager did not disclose the size of the stake proposed to be sold.    Neither that filing, nor one announcing the talks\u2019 end on Thursday, named HNA but people familiar with the matter confirmed the talks were with the Chinese conglomerate.  Cheah and Yeh own 19.2 percent between them. Cheah Company Ltd, a family trust, owns an additional 21.80 percent stake in Value Partners. The combined 41 percent stake was worth $820 million at market close on Thursday.  A stake in Value Partners, among Asia\u2019s largest independent asset managers, was one of series of equity deals in financial groups being pursued by HNA as it looks to expand beyond its base in airlines, tourism and logistics.   The ending of talks was \u201csolely a result of the parties\u2019 commercial consideration in respect of the possible transaction\u201d, Value Partners said in its exchange filing on Thursday. It did not elaborate.   Shares in Value Partners were down 3.9 percent at 0604 GMT, while the Hang Seng index .HSI was 0.1 percent lower.   Prices of HNA\u2019s bonds were unchanged, while bond traders said HNA\u2019s need to roll over its existing financing would have made any deal difficult to finance.  \u201cOur base case assumption was this deal would not go through,\u201d said a bond trader at a U.S. bank. \u201cAny fresh financing is not a wise move for them as they have to go to the same banks they need to go to for rolling over.\u201d  Value Partners and HNA declined to comment.  HNA last year started a push into financial services, buying large minority stakes in the U.S. operations of Old Mutual Asset Management and also in Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE).  It also bought New Zealand\u2019s largest non-banking lender, UDC Finance, and a controlling interest in hedge fund platform SkyBridge Capital in the United States.  New Zealand\u2019s regulator blocked the UDC deal last month and the SkyBridge deal has not yet closed.  In November the conglomerate also suffered a downgrade in its creditworthiness, as measured by S&P Global Ratings, as a result of its \u201caggressive financial policy\u201d.  An HNA executive told Reuters in December that the conglomerate was not facing a liquidity crisis and characterized its high-profile investments - such as Deutsche Bank and hotels group Hilton (HLT.N) - as successful.  Financial services accounted for about 17 percent of the group\u2019s operating revenue of 183 billion yuan ($28.22 billion), and more than 40 percent of gross profit in 2016, led by its financial leasing operations, an HNA Group bond filing shows.

          "body": "BERLIN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - German retail sales surged more than expected in November, data showed on Friday, boosting hopes that private consumption propped up growth in Europe\u2019s biggest economy at the end of last year.  The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision, showed retail sales rose by 2.3 percent on the month in real terms, the Federal Statistics Office said. That beat the Reuters consensus forecast for a 1 percent increase and came after an upwardly revised drop of 1 percent in October.  Germans revelling in record-high employment, a secure job market, rising wages and low borrowing costs are casting their traditional thriftiness aside to spend more, helping private consumption replace exports as the main growth driver.  On the year, retail sales climbed by 4.4, overshooting a Reuters consensus forecast for a 2.5 percent increase.  The Statistics Office estimated that retail sales increased by between 2.7 percent and 3.1 percent in real terms in 2017 overall.  The retail sales data came after a GfK survey in late December showed consumers felt more optimistic heading into January, unperturbed by political parties\u2019 failure to form a new government.

          "body": "MANILA (Reuters) - A group of Philippine lawmakers will call for a congressional inquiry this month into a recent shopping mall fire that killed 38 people, of whom 37 worked at a call center for an American firm, a House representative said on Friday.  The Dec. 23 blaze in Davao City, the southern hometown of President Rodrigo Duterte, broke out on the third level of a mall before its choking smoke engulfed the offices of the U.S. firm, Research Now SSI, a floor above.  Five members of the Davao City fire department, who had inspected the mall and issued permits for it to operate, were relieved of duties and face administrative investigation.  Initial checks by the Bureau of Fire Protection revealed signs of fire safety lapses that may have contributed to the tragedy, since there were problems with \u201cexits, sprinkler systems and alarm systems\u201d.  \u201cWe are calling for an investigation in aid of legislation,\u201d Congresswoman Arlene Brosas of Gabriela, a women\u2019s group, told a news conference.   \u201cWe are filing a resolution as soon as the session starts. We will call anew the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Standards (bill).\u201d  The lower house of Congress will resume its session on Jan. 15.  The left-wing bloc will seek to ensure the accountability of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, the Labour Department, the Davao City government and companies involved, Brosas said.  A security officer of the New City Commercial Center shopping mall was among the 38 killed in the fire, which injured six people, although about 100 call center employees survived.  SSI has declined to comment on the issue of fire safety at its Davao offices until the investigation is completed.  The Research Now SSI offices in Davao employ 500 people. It promised to relocate some to a bigger facility in the central Philippines while looking for a new site in the south.  On its website, SSI says it has more than 11 million panelists in 40 countries with more than 300 clients worldwide, including Twitter, Facebook, Nielsen, Capital One, BestBuy and Liberty Mutual.

          "body": "BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Central European currencies are expected to extend last year\u2019s gains in 2018, led by the Czech crown, as the region\u2019s economies roar ahead without much worry that they will overheat.  The crown and the Polish zloty were the world\u2019s top-performing currencies last year. Both gained more than 5 percent against the euro and about 20 percent versus the dollar.  Their gains were much bigger, especially for the zloty, than analysts projected in a Reuters poll a year ago.  According to a new Jan. 2-4 Reuters poll of analysts and foreign exchange strategists, the crown EURCZK= will  strengthen further and gain 2.4 percent against the euro relative to the end of last year, to 24.95, by the end of 2018.  The zloty EURPLN= and the forint EURHUF= are expected to gain about one percent this year, to 4.13 and 307.5, respectively, by the end of 2018.  A rally in the first sessions of the year, fueled by a selling of the dollar in global markets, has brought the latter two currencies near the projected end-year levels.  But those gains are overdone, and the currencies are expected to give up some ground in the short term, said DZ Bank\u2019s Sandra Striffler, who was the best forecaster for the region\u2019s currencies on the one-month horizon last year.  \u201cBut if more and more investors return from holidays, other issues will gain the upper hand again, at the expense of the zloty and the forint,\u201d she said.  In Hungary, the central bank continues to loosen monetary policy before elections in April or May. Meanwhile, Warsaw\u2019s tension with Brussels over Poland\u2019s judiciary reforms may put pressure on the zloty in the next months.  But over the full year, the crown and the zloty could repeat last year\u2019s strong performance, Striffler said.  Analysts said the main factors for currency gains were robust growth in the region and its main trade partner, the euro zone, and expectations monetary policy would tighten in Europe.  Hungary\u2019s central bank is unlikely to lift its main rate this year and next, but its economic growth and current account surpluses buoy the forint.  \u201cThe central bank ... is running out of loosening tools and from the second half, it will not be able to prevent a forint rise,\u201d said Peter Virovacz, analyst of ING. \u201cIt will not care,  either ... as a stronger forint can keep a possible inflation rise at bay.\u201d  In Romania, where a robust wage rise is fuelling worries of economic overheating, the leu EURRON= is not expected to strengthen this year, after shedding about 3 percent versus the euro last year.  The poll sees Serbia\u2019s dinar EURRSD= easing 1.3 percent this year, to 120 against the euro.  Additional reporting by Indradip Ghosh in Bangalore, editing by Larry King"

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has changed the status of its national oil giant  Aramco to a joint-stock company as of Jan. 1, in a key step for an initial public offering (IPO) planned for later this year.  The sale of up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco, expected to go ahead in the second half of 2018, is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to reduce the dependence of the Saudi economy on oil. The plan is championed by Saudi crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.  The change, which was published in a cabinet decree in the kingdom\u2019s official bulletin on Friday, is a requirement for local companies in Saudi Arabia ahead of listing, a senior Aramco source, who declined to be named, told Reuters.  \u201cAs a customary step in the preparation process for a Saudi IPO, Saudi Aramco has converted to a joint stock company,\u201d the source said.  \u201cThis establishes the framework to allow future investors to hold shares in the company alongside its shareholder, the government.\u201d  But it is an important step as it shows the IPO process, which could be the biggest in history raising up to $100 billion, is moving ahead despite market speculation it could be delayed or totally shelved.  Prince Mohammad told Reuters in October it was still on track for 2018.  Aramco has a fully paid capital of 60 billion riyals ($16.00 billion) divided into 200 billion ordinary shares, according to the company\u2019s bylaws published in the official bulletin.   The firm\u2019s board will have 11 members and the power to list the company in domestic and international markets, it said. The government will propose 6 members of Aramco\u2019s board, but shareholders with a more than 0.1 percent stake will have the right to propose a member to the general assembly.  The government will have the right to appoint or change the company\u2019s chairman, a position currently held by Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih.  The government will remain the major shareholder of Aramco and retain the ultimate decision on output levels and production capacity, it said.  \u201cThe state will remain the only responsible entity to make the final decisions regarding the maximum levels of hydrocarbons that can be produced at any time,\u201d it said.    Saudi officials have said domestic and international exchanges such as New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong have been looked at for a partial listing of the state-run oil firm.  They also left the door open for other options including an exclusive listing on the kingdom\u2019s bourse Tadawul and an IPO coupled with a private placement to a strategic investor as a precursor to an international IPO.  Aramco\u2019s IPO will comply with regulations of the Saudi stock exchange and also regulations of the international market where it will be listed, the official bulletin said.  Investors have long debated whether Aramco could be valued anywhere close to $2 trillion, the figure announced by the crown prince, who wants to raise cash through the IPO to finance investment aimed at helping wean the world\u2019s biggest oil exporting nation off its dependency on crude.  A kingpin of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia is also leading members and other rival oil producers such as Russia to restrict oil supplies under a global oil pact to drain inventories and boost oil prices.  In November, OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 as they try to finish clearing a global glut of crude while signaling a possible early exit from the deal if the market overheats.

          "title": "Code crackdown: China payments restrictions to hit profits",
          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - A decision by China\u2019s central bank to rein in reserve funds held by payment firms could cost the industry upwards of $689 million a year, spur consolidation and alter the way Asia\u2019s biggest tech firms move money.  Mobile payments using in-app QR or bar-codes have become ubiquitous for everything from taxis to grocery shopping and bike rental in China in recent years, with customers making 19 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) in transactions in 2016, according to iResearch.   The rapid uptake has spurred fears that mobile payment firms, without oversight, could misuse funds held while transactions between users and merchants clear.  Regulations unveiled by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) on Saturday require firms to allocate 42 to 50 percent of their total client funds in regulated interest-free reserve accounts by April, up from a current rate of 12 to 20 percent.  The move will hit services backed by Tencent Group Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) affiliate Ant Financial, which together make up over 93 percent of China\u2019s online payments market, according to research firm Analysys International.   It\u2019s part of a two-year government crackdown on financial risks in the country\u2019s fast growing and loosely regulated online finance sector, aimed at limiting the activities of third-party payment services, online asset managers, micro lenders and others.   The central bank has said it will eventually raise the ratio to 100 percent but hasn\u2019t given a timeline.  The moves will impact a major source of profit for online payment firms, particularly those that relied on the interest income for fast growth during the early boom years.       \u201cFrom an industry perspective, these changes will alter the economics underlying certain revenue streams,\u201d said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific Fintech lead at EY.   \u201cClearly the PBOC is increasingly considering the potential financial stability risks associated with large-scale mass-market non-traditional players.\u201d  China\u2019s e-commerce and mobile payments market has enjoyed explosive growth in recent years with Alipay and Tencent\u2019s Tenpay each accumulating over 500 million users.  Client reserve funds are prepaid sums from buyers that are held temporarily by payment companies before they are transferred to merchants. Payment firms typically deposit them into bank accounts where they earn interest.  Interest income earned on those reserve funds accounted for 11 percent of total income for internet-based payment companies, data from Zhongtai Securities shows.      The latest hike in reserves will slash more than 4.48 billion yuan ($689 million) in annual interest earnings from the industry, according to Reuters calculations, under the assumption that payment companies could have earned 3 percent annualized interest rate on those funds.  Analysts say large, diversified firms such as Ant Financial and Tencent will be able to absorb the costs, and seek to replace revenue with income from other products, including wealth management tools and micro-loans.   The move puts extra pressure on the two top firms, however, who are facing barriers at home and abroad as regulators balk at the technical and financial implications of their rapid expansion.   Ant Financial on Wednesday announced it has withdrawn a $1.2 billion acquisition bid for U.S. money transfer firm Moneygram International Inc (MGI.O) after U.S. government panel rejected the bid over national security concerns.  Ant Financial said it was supportive of the PBOC\u2019s move. Tencent did not respond to a request for comment.   Smaller payment firms could face consolidation as their margins slide. There are currently more than 200 companies licensed to provide such services.   Shanghai-based All In Pay Network Service, which has 1.7 million merchants, said it would adjust its business to comply with the central bank\u2019s new policy.   \u201cIn terms of the actual impact it will have on our company, that still remains to be seen,\u201d it said.  The move will allow China\u2019s central bank to gain more insight into capital flows within the industry as it seeks to quell financial risks associated with the massive funds now kept by third-party payment companies.  The rules on reserve funds also pave the way for the establishment of a new government-directed clearing house for third-party payment companies, which is expected to launch in June. The new entity will enable the central bank to track all online financial transaction data and the flow of funds in the industry, analysts say.  In August, the regulator instructed third-party payment firms to route all of their transactions through the centralized clearing house, in which its affiliated companies own largest stakes.  In addition to new rules on reserve funds and clearing, last week the PBOC also announced plans to cap barcode payments to as low as 500 yuan to rein in risks arising from the popular service.  \u201cPreventing risks remains the core theme in 2018,\u201d CITIC Securities said in a research note. \u201cPayment giants are likely to slow down their aggressive marketing deployed in the early stages of development and pay more attention to compliance.\u201d   Additional Reporting by SHANGHAI Newsroom; Editing by Lincoln Feast"

          "title": "Hong Kong stock rally gains momentum from China share reform",
          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese appetite for Hong Kong equities, ample cash supply and optimism over share reforms could propel the city\u2019s benchmark stock index up as much as 15 percent this year, after an already bullish run in 2017, fund managers and analysts say.  The Hang Seng Index .HSI was the best performing stock index among major markets last year, surging 36 percent. It is now 4 percent away from a record high hit in October 2007.  Particular focus is on moves by China to allow shareholders of mainland-incorporated firms listed in Hong Kong to release their locked-up shares and trade them in the open equity market .HSCE. Such reforms would boost share supply but could lead to improved corporate governance and valuations, analysts said.  \u201cIn the first half of this year, the Hang Seng Index will continue to test record highs and will have the chance to rise to 34,000-35,000 points,\u201d said Ben Kwong, chief operating officer at securities firm KGI Asia in Hong Kong.  However, it may fall back to the 30,000-32,000 level in the second half as higher interest rates and an expected stronger U.S. dollar trigger profit-taking, Kwong added.  Market watchers expect regulators to be cautious on the pace of H-share reform to avoid the benchmark index - where valuations are still much cheaper than in mainland China - becoming too volatile.  China will initially select up to three companies in the H-share convertibility pilot scheme, but investors see the move as a positive step.        Optimism over the scheme sent the benchmark index past the 30,000-mark to a decade high this week.  The convertibility reform is expected to align major shareholders\u2019 interests with other stakeholders, paving the way for greater scrutiny over corporate governance which has dogged many Chinese companies amid a series of scandals.   \u201cRight now large shareholders\u2019 shares cannot be traded, so the stock price move does not impact them...if their shares can be circulated, they should care about how investors think and then improve corporate governance,\u201d said Victoria Mio, Asia Pacific equities co-head at asset manager Robeco. \u201c2018 will be another bull market for the Hong Kong market.\u201d  Southbound fund flows have increased since the stock connect schemes that link Shanghai and Shenzhen to Hong Kong markets were launched in 2014 and 2016, respectively. Total net inflows to the Hong Kong market have climbed to around 12 percent of daily turnover.  \u201cWe will probably see southbound trading reach more than 15 percent, or even 20 percent of Hong Kong\u2019s market turnover in mid-2018,\u201d said Ivan Li, a research director at DBS Vickers Securities.  H-share reform is also expected to improve market liquidity and attract more foreign funds as major shareholders of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies pay more attention.   \u201cMajor shareholders will have more incentive to communicate with investors to boost their share price and market valuation as the reform is gradually implemented,\u201d said Yang Delong, a managing director at First Seafront Fund in Shenzhen.  Yang said it was a good time to invest in Hong Kong stocks, which he forecast have at least a 10 percent upside.   \u201cA big risk in the second half is the yuan may depreciate, which will cause capital outflows. If that happens, Chinese regulators may take measures to avoid fund outflows and funds flowing into Hong Kong will fall,\u201d said KGI Asia\u2019s Kwong.

          "body": "* Naphtha imports from the West at highest in two years  * High volumes push naphtha cracks from 22-month highs  * Q1 cracks unlikely to return to late 2017 peaks- analysts (Adds graphic)  By Seng Li Peng  SINGAPORE, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Asia is set to receive up to 2.0 million tonnes of naphtha from the West this month, the highest amount in two years, putting pressure on light fuel margins that touched 22-month highs in November.  High refinery runs and a lack of demand for naphtha as a gasoline blendstock over the colder, wetter winter months in Europe and the United States have resulted in unused naphtha, traders said.  Some 1.9 million to 2.0 million tonnes of naphtha - the key feedstock for petrochemicals such as plastics and polyester - was booked to arrive in Asia in January, traders said, the highest monthly Western volume since January 2016.  Asia, being structurally short of naphtha, is an attractive sales outlet for surplus Western supplies.  But the volumes due from the West are way above 2017\u2019s average monthly arrivals of 1.2 million tonnes, with spot premiums around November/December pushing to their highest since 2015.  The high arrivals have dragged Asia\u2019s naphtha crack to a 2-1/2 month low of $104.95 a tonne on Thursday NAF-SIN-CRK, down from a 22-month high of nearly $135 a tonne on Nov. 13.  \u201c1.9 million tonnes from the West seems high to me as we have not seen that level for a long time,\u201d said Premasish Das of IHS Markit.  \u201cIf you look at the high gasoline inventories in Europe and the U.S. along with weaker seasonal demand, it is unlikely that naphtha exports will reduce in February/March,\u201d he added.  Some trade and industry sources expect the weakness in the naphtha crack to pass as supplies could be soaked up by strong demand, especially due to a lack of cheap liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), used as an alternative feedstock.  LPG, also used for heating, usually becomes more readily available in summer.  But they added that naphtha crack levels in the first quarter were unlikely to return to the peak levels seen in late 2017.  \u201cNaphtha demand is set to remain strong in light of supportive steam cracking margins, and seasonal maintenance is not expected to constrain steam cracker run rates until the end of Q1,\u201d said Andrada Irimie of consulting firm JBC Energy.  \u201cWeaker LPG prices could offer some pressure to naphtha cracks, placing a ceiling on cracks which means they are unlikely to reach and sustain their early-December crack levels again over the next few months.\u201d  IHS Markit\u2019s Das said he did not expect very high cracks in February/March.  \u201cIf the crude price stays high, that would be the other impediment,\u201d he added, with naphtha priced off Brent.

          "title": "Consumer loan securitization boom put on hold as China clamps down on leverage",
          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - A boom in asset-backed securities issued by micro-lenders aiming to expand in China\u2019s fast-growing online credit market looks set to slow this year amid growing regulatory scrutiny.  Micro-lenders have raised billions of dollars packaging consumer loans into securities for sale to institutional investors on China\u2019s nascent market for asset-backed securities in order to rapidly expand their loan books.  Many of China\u2019s largest internet and technology companies have issued securities backed by micro-loans. Ant Financial  Services Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N), dominates the market and the finance arms of JD.com Inc (JD.O), Baidu Inc (BIDU.O), VIPShop Holdings (VIPS.N) and Xiaomi Technology have also raised funds through the products.   But the market for the securities is set to slow this year, industry sources say, as regulators target lenders\u2019 high debt levels and limited asset disclosure.  Rules announced on Dec. 1 limited the amount of lending backed by the products the companies can make. They were also required to consolidate them on their balance sheets.  China\u2019s exchanges and the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII) have suspended the issuance of securities backed by consumer loans by Internet-based micro-lenders, said Guo Yonggang, general manager of the structured financing department at Golden Credit Rating International Co.  NAFMII last week amended its disclosure requirements for consumer loan securities to reflect the central bank\u2019s higher transparency standards.  The volume of securities backed by consumer loans has surged over 35-fold in the last two years, with the proceeds used to finance loans to individuals looking to buy the latest iPhone or finance overseas holidays.  About 489.4 billion yuan ($75.36 billion) of the securities were issued in 2017, compared with 98.9 billion yuan in 2016, according to China Securitisation Analytics.  Repackaging the loans as asset-backed securities has allowed lenders to transfer the loans off their balance sheets, bypassing government rules stipulating how much they can lend in proportion to their equity capital.  Ant Financial is the largest issuer of consumer loan securities, accounting for 60 percent of all issues in 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on data from China Securitisation Analytics.  Its two Chongqing-based micro-loan companies had total net capital of 10.6 billion yuan, but issued 265.1 billion yuan in loans by the end of June, according to CIB Research, a unit of Industrial Bank Co (601166.SS). Outstanding loan securities issued by the two units have exceeded 250 billion yuan, it said.  \u201cThe ratio of total financing to total capital is far beyond the 2.3-times leverage requirement set by the Chongqing banking regulator,\u201d CIB Research said in a December report.  As Beijing issued its new rules, Ant Financial has quietly withdrawn plans to issue asset-backed notes worth billions of dollars, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.   Officials from the People\u2019s Bank of China have met with Ant Financial to discuss the high debt levels of its consumer finance business, said one of the sources. The source said the central bank may prevent Ant from issuing new consumer loan securities until it reduced its leverage level.  Ant said the program\u2019s cancellation was due to \u201ctight funding conditions and rising pricing on the bond market\u201d at the end of 2017.  The company plans to increase registered capital in two consumer loan units - Chongqing Mayi Micro Loans Co and Chongqing Mayi Shangcheng Small Loans Co - to 12 billion yuan, from 3.8 billion yuan at present, the company said in an email.  The central bank did not respond to a faxed request for comment.  The short history of micro-loan companies and China\u2019s asset-backed securities market raises significant challenges for ratings agencies and investors trying to gauge risk.  \u201cThe hypotheses or parameter estimations we use for data analysis could differ from the actual situation to some degree,\u201d said Zheng Kaiwen, senior analyst at China Chengxin Securities Rating Co, pointing to loan companies\u2019 short business histories.  There has yet to be a default from a consumer loan securitization product, according to China Chengxin.   But the likelihood of default may be \u201cunderestimated\u201d, said Guo of Golden Credit Rating, citing incomplete credit ratings data and the rapid expansion of consumer loans.   Before the government cleanup, small and mid-tier Chinese banks, as well as private funds with high risk tolerance, were among the most active buyers of micro loan securities, loan companies said.  In March, Bank of Jiangsu Co (600919.SS) and Debang Securities launched a 20 billion yuan investment fund focused on loan-backed securities, the first of its kind in China.  Despite government efforts to control consumer loan-backed securities, reining them in will be difficult as many transactions take place \u201coff-market\u201d, company sources said.   Those private sales take place on local financial exchanges and equity trading centers, as well as internet-based financial trading platforms powered by Chinese tech giants, making them difficult for the government to track.  Several ratings agencies and loan companies said they were unable to accurately estimate the total of such private transactions due to limited information disclosure.  Some loan companies choosing private sales have weak operating quality, aggressive strategies and incomplete risk control systems, said Guo at Golden Credit Rating.  \u201cDue to the weak information disclosure of off-market product issues, borrowers could have taken out loans from multiple platforms, or these loans could just be non-compliant campus loans or housing down-payment loans,\u201d he said.

          "body": "(Repeats story to additional subscribers, no changes to text)  * Iraqi Shi\u2019ite militias seen acting as second army  * Most groups are backed and trained by Iran  * Prime Minister Abadi plans to limit their influence  * Iran-allied militia leader main challenger to Abadi  * PM Abadi forming unlikely alliance with fiery cleric  By Ahmed Rasheed  BAGHDAD, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Under pressure from allies in the West, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is staking his career on reining in the Shi\u2019ite militias that helped him defeat Islamic State.  The task will not be easy. The paramilitaries, or Popular Mobilisation Forces, are mostly trained and backed by Iran, so Abadi risks angering his most powerful regional backer.  Iraq\u2019s Shi\u2019ite majority also see the PMF\u2019s 150,000 fighters as their saviours. Several militia commanders plan to run against Abadi in parliamentary elections in May and some have warned they will resist attempts to dismantle them.  Abadi\u2019s plan envisages taking back the militias\u2019 heavy weapons and cutting their strength by half, according to military and intelligence sources. The army is already taking an inventory of PMF weaponry, such as the armoured vehicles and tanks the government gave them to fight Islamic State.  Next, Abadi will order his military and police commanders to take back those heavy weapons under the pretext of repairing them. The defence ministry will then remove over-age or physically unfit fighters, two military sources said.  \u201cThe plan will be implemented with extreme caution and precision in order to prevent a negative backlash from the PMF commanders,\u201d said an army colonel who was briefed on it by his commander. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep a second army within one state; this is the key objective of the plan.\u201d  The plan will be closely followed by Iran and the United States. The groups are one of Iran\u2019s many levers of influence in Iraq, while for Washington they are a reminder of Tehran\u2019s growing reach in the Middle East.  Lawmakers close to Abadi and one of his political advisers say he is coming under \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d from the West and Sunni regional allies to dissolve the PMF now that Islamic State, or Daesh, is no longer a major threat.  \u201cPrime Minister Abadi is getting messages from allies in the war against Daesh encouraging him to dismantle the PMF as a condition to keeping their support flowing in future,\u201d the adviser said on condition of anonymity.  In a phone call last month, French President Emmanuel Macron encouraged Abadi to dismantle the PMF, said the adviser, who was briefed on the call.  With Islamic State crushed in Iraq, Abadi will find it harder to avoid clamping down on the militia, according to a lawmaker from his Dawa Party.  \u201cAbadi would respond to pressure from his Western and Gulf allies to dissolve the PMF by saying he needs them to fight Daesh, but now Daesh is finished and there are no more excuses to keep the PMF,\u201d the lawmaker said.  In any case Abadi does not trust the Iranians, whose militia allies act like a state within a state, said a Shi\u2019ite lawmaker close to the prime minister.  \u201cAbadi sees the support of the West, the United States and regional Arab states as indispensable in making Iraq more stable in future,\u201d the lawmaker said.  But militia commanders, such as Ali al-Hussaini from the Imam Ali Brigades, say the PMF played a major part in defeating Islamic State and dismantling them would be a \u201cbig mistake\u201d.  \u201cWe have millions of followers who will defend our rights against any attempt to target us,\u201d he said.  Nonetheless, a joint committee from the army, police, and intelligence services will review the number of PMF fighters and make recommendations to Abadi, who will decide who will stay and who will be retired, said a military intelligence colonel who is close to the military chief of staff\u2019s office.  Abadi would also order his commanders to restructure their own forces.  Another army colonel said taking heavy weapons from the militias would not be easy, as they control hundreds of headquarters, arms stockpiles, camps, and even small rocket factories.  Disarming the militias is one of Abadi\u2019s most delicate challenges. They are generally more effective than the Iraqi security forces and often defy Baghdad with the support of Tehran.  They also have the blessing of Iraq\u2019s most influential Shi\u2019ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.  Iraqi Shi\u2019ite militia commanders are openly loyal to Tehran, Iranian advisers are seen on Iraqi battlefields, and Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Abadi in June against weakening the militias.  The PMF gained prominence after Sistani called on Iraqis to take up arms against Islamic State when it seized a third of the country in 2014.  Since then the militias have become more assertive, riding around cities in vehicles flying their own flags. They are accused of terrorising minority Sunnis, which they deny.  Security sources and analysts say any attempt by Abadi to muzzle the PMF could invite a backlash from Shi\u2019ites, who expect the militias to protect them in the event of renewed sectarian conflict in Iraq.  Any backlash could lead to the election of an alliance of Iranian-backed political parties to enough seats in parliament to end Abadi\u2019s bid for a second term.  Abadi\u2019s success against Islamic State and in quashing a Kurdish bid for independence in Iraq may tempt him into over-confidence in acting against the militias, said Jasim al-Bahadli, a Baghdad-based expert on Shi\u2019ite armed groups.  \u201cPlaying hard with the PMF could be a double-edged sword; they have broad popularity that Abadi should not underestimate.\u201d  To counter the PMF\u2019s popularity, Abadi has turned to the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who once led an armed rebellion against U.S. occupation forces and was named the most dangerous man in Iraq by the Pentagon.  The pair held a secret meeting in the holy Shi\u2019ite city of Karbala on Nov. 11 to discuss Sadr helping the government disarm the militias, accoording to aides for both men who attended the meeting.  Sadr sees the militias as a threat to his role as a kingmaker in Iraq\u2019s turbulent politics.  During their meeting, Abadi asked Sadr to support him in his bid to \u201ccleanse the country\u201d of corrupt politicians and those who might try to use armed groups to influence the election, an adviser to Sadr said.  \u201cThey talked about putting an end to the militias operating above the law, fighting corruption, and of course supporting Abadi\u2019s bid to be prime minister for a second term,\u201d he said.  Several lawmakers close to Abadi and sources close to Sadr said the prime minister had secured the cleric\u2019s support to stop the PMF interfering in the election.  \u201cSadr can put hundreds of thousands on the streets in solidarity with Abadi with one call, he would make Abadi\u2019s opponents think twice before challenging him,\u201d said a senior Shi\u2019ite politician close to Sadr.  Indeed, Sadr plans to do just that in the very near future, another source close to him said.  Sources close to Sadr said he also promised to persuade Sistani to support Abadi\u2019s plans to restrain the militias.  That could give Abadi an edge over the militias, which comprise more than 66 groups, over 40 of which are backed by Iran, according to security sources and analysts.  It would also put Abadi in a strong position against one of his main challengers, Hadi al-Amiri, who commands Iraq\u2019s largest Iranian-backed Shi\u2019ite militia, the Badr Organisation.  \u201cBadr will lead the PMF list in next election under the leadership of Hadi al-Amiri,\u201d said Ameer al-Kinani, a Sadrist adviser to Iraqi President Fuad Masum. \u201cThis is known to all.\u201d (Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed; Writing by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Michael Georgy and Giles Elgood)"

          "title": "Investors sense opportunities in Big Oil - but mind the gap",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are gaining confidence - up to a point - that 2018 will be the year of oil stocks.  While shares in top energy companies have risen since mid-2017, they have failed to keep step with recovering crude markets, opening up a historically unusual performance gap. Big oil stocks have also underperformed broader equity indexes.  Uncertainty over whether the crude rally can stick and fears that advances in electric vehicles will undermine longer-term demand for oil still overshadow the sector.  But a brighter outlook for oil prices compared with the slump of 2014-15 - coupled with a revival in energy companies\u2019 profits and cash generation after three years of brutal cuts - could mark a turning point, according to investors and a string of global banks.   \u201c2017 was a challenging year for investors but there are now real opportunities in the energy sector,\u201d said Olivia Markham, portfolio manager at BlackRock Commodities Income Investment Trust. She expects oil prices to rise gradually by 2020 as supplies tighten due to a dive in investment in recent years.  UBS, RBC and JP Morgan have put out strongly positive outlooks for the sector in recent weeks, while Barclays analysts predicted on Thursday that earnings for the European integrated oil stocks could grow 20 percent from the third quarter.  Optimists point to developments like Shell\u2019s (RDSa.L) raising in November of its cash flow outlook to $30 billion from $25 billion by 2020, assuming prices at $60 a barrel.  \u201cAnnus Mirabilis. Highest free cashflow in a decade bodes well for 2018,\u201d Bernstein said in its outlook for European oil majors.  Figures for last year are grim, due largely to a dismal first half. The MSCI world energy index .dMIWO0EN00PUS, which tracks top oil stocks, gained just 1.3 percent even though Brent crude hit 2-1/2 year highs. Europe\u2019s oil and gas sector.SXEP, which includes Shell, Total (TOTF.PA), BP (BP.L) and Eni (ENI.MI), was the worst-performing in the region.   Oil majors\u2019 shares typically move in step with prices of the crude that they extract, but that correlation broke down last year. Since June, the MSCI index has gained 20 percent but Brent LCOc1 shot up 50 percent to around $68 a barrel, after OPEC and other major producers agreed to cut output.  The majors are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, determined to maintain the capital discipline they imposed during the slump.  With production from U.S. shale deposits expected to increase sharply, scepticism remains over whether crude can stay at current levels.  \u201cThere\u2019s little conviction on the oil price sustainability both from the market and from the oil majors because no one is touching capex plans or investment. Everyone is waiting to understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Italian fund manager Banor SIM.  As well as slashing spending, the majors made tens of thousands of staff redundant and sold off assets to adapt to lower oil prices which, despite the recent gains, remain far below levels above $100 in 2011-14. Such savings have led to sharp increases in earnings in recent quarters.  Whether the sector can extend the share rally and close the performance gap in 2018 depends on a belief that majors can still prosper should oil prices fall back again.  \u201cFrom here it\u2019s a question of whether or not investors think something has really changed in the industry, that you can still have earnings improving even if the macro doesn\u2019t help you out,\u201d said Peter Hackworth, oil equity analyst at Goldman Sachs.   As well as the strong cash flow generation at the European majors, early signs of capital discipline among U.S. explorers and producers also point to a better picture for the sector this year.  Goldman predicts big oil firms will return 13 percent in 2018, ahead of a forecast 9 percent rise in the Brent price.   One crucial component in winning back investors\u2019 confidence is a return to paying dividends fully in cash. Offering the option of taking dividends in stock has saved the majors billions upfront but diluted their earnings per share.  Shell and BP have both made enough revenue in recent quarters to boost their payouts. Goldman Sachs estimates most big oil firms will have scrapped scrip dividends or made share buy-backs which offset the dilution in the next 12 months.  Average dividend yields of 5.5 percent will be more than covered by cash flow this year, Hackworth said.  But not all investors have yet accepted the message that current payout levels will continue.  \u201cThe market is still discounting these dividends as unsustainable whereas today, right now, they are sustainable. So I think the market is overreacting,\u201d said Eric Moore, European income fund manager at Miton, who has been increasing his oil holdings in the past year.  Moore\u2019s fund holds BP, Shell, Statoil STL.OL, Eni and Premier Oil. (PMO.L)  Analysts have also been revising up their earnings forecasts since October after sharp downgrades earlier in 2017. Any uptick in mergers and acquisitions - noticeably absent as the majors concentrated on restructuring rather than purchases during the slump \u2013 could also boost the sector.   Investors remain wary that oil demand may peak due to eventual mass adoption of battery-powered cars and more curbs on fossil fuel emissions by industry to meet environmental targets.  \u201cElectric vehicles and government policies on carbon have led investors to question the longer-term outlook for oil,\u201d Blackrock\u2019s Markham said.   Some are hedging their bets, buying shares in battery companies and chipmakers involved in making electric cars while lessening their exposure to pure oil plays.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   But the shift to cleaner energy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean investors are dumping the oil majors. Many are sticking with them but favoring companies which put more emphasis on renewables.   Nick Davis, European income fund manager at Polar Capital, said he prefers Total, which is investing more in gas as well as venturing into battery and solar power.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   But in the shorter term, and with the electric vehicle picture still unclear, stocks do not yet fully price in these risks, analysts said.  Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson said cash preservation remains the key for investors focusing on returns more than growth. For him, BP, Shell, Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) offer the best proposition in 2018, he said in a note.  \u201cThe historical investment model which assumed that higher oil prices would always lead to higher share prices in energy appears disrupted. It failed in 2017 and will again in 2018, in our view.\u201d   GRAPHIC - Oil prices and energy shares: here  Reporting by Helen Reid and Ron Bousso, Editing by Dmitry Zhdannikov and David Stamp"

          "title": "Hong Kong stock rally gains momentum from China share reform",
          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese appetite for Hong Kong equities, ample cash supply and optimism over share reforms could propel the city\u2019s benchmark stock index up as much as 15 percent this year, after an already bullish run in 2017, fund managers and analysts say.  The Hang Seng Index .HSI was the best performing stock index among major markets last year, surging 36 percent. It is now 4 percent away from a record high hit in October 2007.  Particular focus is on moves by China to allow shareholders of mainland-incorporated firms listed in Hong Kong to release their locked-up shares and trade them in the open equity market .HSCE. Such reforms would boost share supply but could lead to improved corporate governance and valuations, analysts said.  \u201cIn the first half of this year, the Hang Seng Index will continue to test record highs and will have the chance to rise to 34,000-35,000 points,\u201d said Ben Kwong, chief operating officer at securities firm KGI Asia in Hong Kong.  However, it may fall back to the 30,000-32,000 level in the second half as higher interest rates and an expected stronger U.S. dollar trigger profit-taking, Kwong added.  Market watchers expect regulators to be cautious on the pace of H-share reform to avoid the benchmark index - where valuations are still much cheaper than in mainland China - becoming too volatile.  China will initially select up to three companies in the H-share convertibility pilot scheme, but investors see the move as a positive step.        Optimism over the scheme sent the benchmark index past the 30,000-mark to a decade high this week.  The convertibility reform is expected to align major shareholders\u2019 interests with other stakeholders, paving the way for greater scrutiny over corporate governance which has dogged many Chinese companies amid a series of scandals.   \u201cRight now large shareholders\u2019 shares cannot be traded, so the stock price move does not impact them...if their shares can be circulated, they should care about how investors think and then improve corporate governance,\u201d said Victoria Mio, Asia Pacific equities co-head at asset manager Robeco. \u201c2018 will be another bull market for the Hong Kong market.\u201d  Southbound fund flows have increased since the stock connect schemes that link Shanghai and Shenzhen to Hong Kong markets were launched in 2014 and 2016, respectively. Total net inflows to the Hong Kong market have climbed to around 12 percent of daily turnover.  \u201cWe will probably see southbound trading reach more than 15 percent, or even 20 percent of Hong Kong\u2019s market turnover in mid-2018,\u201d said Ivan Li, a research director at DBS Vickers Securities.  H-share reform is also expected to improve market liquidity and attract more foreign funds as major shareholders of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies pay more attention.   \u201cMajor shareholders will have more incentive to communicate with investors to boost their share price and market valuation as the reform is gradually implemented,\u201d said Yang Delong, a managing director at First Seafront Fund in Shenzhen.  Yang said it was a good time to invest in Hong Kong stocks, which he forecast have at least a 10 percent upside.   \u201cA big risk in the second half is the yuan may depreciate, which will cause capital outflows. If that happens, Chinese regulators may take measures to avoid fund outflows and funds flowing into Hong Kong will fall,\u201d said KGI Asia\u2019s Kwong.

Asian shares inched closer to a record high after a report released on Thursday showed U.S. private employers added higher-than-expected 250,000 jobs in December.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average sailed past the 25,000 mark for the first time on Thursday, while both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite notched record closing highs.  \u201cThe U.S. market is doing well and that is supporting Indian markets,\u201d said Sumit Pokharna, deputy vice president, Kotak Securities.  The broader NSE index was up 0.32 percent at 10,538.70 as of 0602 GMT, after rising as much as 0.55 percent to a record high.  The benchmark BSE index was 0.40 percent higher at 34,103.92, after gaining as much as 0.61 percent to an all-time peak.  Both the indexes were marginally higher for the week after four straight weekly gains.  Banking stocks rose after the lower house of parliament approved the government\u2019s plan to inject 800 billion rupees ($12.62 billion) into the sector as part of its recapitalisation plan.  Yes Bank was the top percentage gainer with a rise of as much as 5.5 percent. The Nifty PSU Bank index climbed as much as 1.1 percent after Thursday\u2019s 2.7 percent rise.

          "body": "(Repeats story from Thursday)  * Iraqi Shi\u2019ite militias seen acting as second army  * Most groups are backed and trained by Iran  * Prime Minister Abadi plans to limit their influence  * Iran-allied militia leader main challenger to Abadi  * PM Abadi forming unlikely alliance with fiery cleric  By Ahmed Rasheed  BAGHDAD, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Under pressure from allies in the West, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is staking his career on reining in the Shi\u2019ite militias that helped him defeat Islamic State.  The task will not be easy. The paramilitaries, or Popular Mobilisation Forces, are mostly trained and backed by Iran, so Abadi risks angering his most powerful regional backer.  Iraq\u2019s Shi\u2019ite majority also see the PMF\u2019s 150,000 fighters as their saviours. Several militia commanders plan to run against Abadi in parliamentary elections in May and some have warned they will resist attempts to dismantle them.  Abadi\u2019s plan envisages taking back the militias\u2019 heavy weapons and cutting their strength by half, according to military and intelligence sources. The army is already taking an inventory of PMF weaponry, such as the armoured vehicles and tanks the government gave them to fight Islamic State.  Next, Abadi will order his military and police commanders to take back those heavy weapons under the pretext of repairing them. The defence ministry will then remove over-age or physically unfit fighters, two military sources said.  \u201cThe plan will be implemented with extreme caution and precision in order to prevent a negative backlash from the PMF commanders,\u201d said an army colonel who was briefed on it by his commander. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep a second army within one state; this is the key objective of the plan.\u201d  The plan will be closely followed by Iran and the United States. The groups are one of Iran\u2019s many levers of influence in Iraq, while for Washington they are a reminder of Tehran\u2019s growing reach in the Middle East.  Lawmakers close to Abadi and one of his political advisers say he is coming under \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d from the West and Sunni regional allies to dissolve the PMF now that Islamic State, or Daesh, is no longer a major threat.  \u201cPrime Minister Abadi is getting messages from allies in the war against Daesh encouraging him to dismantle the PMF as a condition to keeping their support flowing in future,\u201d the adviser said on condition of anonymity.  In a phone call last month, French President Emmanuel Macron encouraged Abadi to dismantle the PMF, said the adviser, who was briefed on the call.  With Islamic State crushed in Iraq, Abadi will find it harder to avoid clamping down on the militia, according to a lawmaker from his Dawa Party.  \u201cAbadi would respond to pressure from his Western and Gulf allies to dissolve the PMF by saying he needs them to fight Daesh, but now Daesh is finished and there are no more excuses to keep the PMF,\u201d the lawmaker said.  In any case Abadi does not trust the Iranians, whose militia allies act like a state within a state, said a Shi\u2019ite lawmaker close to the prime minister.  \u201cAbadi sees the support of the West, the United States and regional Arab states as indispensable in making Iraq more stable in future,\u201d the lawmaker said.  But militia commanders, such as Ali al-Hussaini from the Imam Ali Brigades, say the PMF played a major part in defeating Islamic State and dismantling them would be a \u201cbig mistake\u201d.  \u201cWe have millions of followers who will defend our rights against any attempt to target us,\u201d he said.  Nonetheless, a joint committee from the army, police, and intelligence services will review the number of PMF fighters and make recommendations to Abadi, who will decide who will stay and who will be retired, said a military intelligence colonel who is close to the military chief of staff\u2019s office.  Abadi would also order his commanders to restructure their own forces.  Another army colonel said taking heavy weapons from the militias would not be easy, as they control hundreds of headquarters, arms stockpiles, camps, and even small rocket factories.  Disarming the militias is one of Abadi\u2019s most delicate challenges. They are generally more effective than the Iraqi security forces and often defy Baghdad with the support of Tehran.  They also have the blessing of Iraq\u2019s most influential Shi\u2019ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.  Iraqi Shi\u2019ite militia commanders are openly loyal to Tehran, Iranian advisers are seen on Iraqi battlefields, and Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Abadi in June against weakening the militias.  The PMF gained prominence after Sistani called on Iraqis to take up arms against Islamic State when it seized a third of the country in 2014.  Since then the militias have become more assertive, riding around cities in vehicles flying their own flags. They are accused of terrorising minority Sunnis, which they deny.  Security sources and analysts say any attempt by Abadi to muzzle the PMF could invite a backlash from Shi\u2019ites, who expect the militias to protect them in the event of renewed sectarian conflict in Iraq.  Any backlash could lead to the election of an alliance of Iranian-backed political parties to enough seats in parliament to end Abadi\u2019s bid for a second term.  Abadi\u2019s success against Islamic State and in quashing a Kurdish bid for independence in Iraq may tempt him into over-confidence in acting against the militias, said Jasim al-Bahadli, a Baghdad-based expert on Shi\u2019ite armed groups.  \u201cPlaying hard with the PMF could be a double-edged sword; they have broad popularity that Abadi should not underestimate.\u201d  To counter the PMF\u2019s popularity, Abadi has turned to the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who once led an armed rebellion against U.S. occupation forces and was named the most dangerous man in Iraq by the Pentagon.  The pair held a secret meeting in the holy Shi\u2019ite city of Karbala on Nov. 11 to discuss Sadr helping the government disarm the militias, accoording to aides for both men who attended the meeting.  Sadr sees the militias as a threat to his role as a kingmaker in Iraq\u2019s turbulent politics.  During their meeting, Abadi asked Sadr to support him in his bid to \u201ccleanse the country\u201d of corrupt politicians and those who might try to use armed groups to influence the election, an adviser to Sadr said.  \u201cThey talked about putting an end to the militias operating above the law, fighting corruption, and of course supporting Abadi\u2019s bid to be prime minister for a second term,\u201d he said.  Several lawmakers close to Abadi and sources close to Sadr said the prime minister had secured the cleric\u2019s support to stop the PMF interfering in the election.  \u201cSadr can put hundreds of thousands on the streets in solidarity with Abadi with one call, he would make Abadi\u2019s opponents think twice before challenging him,\u201d said a senior Shi\u2019ite politician close to Sadr.  Indeed, Sadr plans to do just that in the very near future, another source close to him said.  Sources close to Sadr said he also promised to persuade Sistani to support Abadi\u2019s plans to restrain the militias.  That could give Abadi an edge over the militias, which comprise more than 66 groups, over 40 of which are backed by Iran, according to security sources and analysts.  It would also put Abadi in a strong position against one of his main challengers, Hadi al-Amiri, who commands Iraq\u2019s largest Iranian-backed Shi\u2019ite militia, the Badr Organisation.  \u201cBadr will lead the PMF list in next election under the leadership of Hadi al-Amiri,\u201d said Ameer al-Kinani, a Sadrist adviser to Iraqi President Fuad Masum. \u201cThis is known to all.\u201d (Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed; Writing by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Michael Georgy and Giles Elgood)"

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, January 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Hong Kong-based rail transit network operator MTR Corporation Ltd's (MTRC) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'AA+'. The Outlook is Stable. The agency has also affirmed MTRC's Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR at 'F1+' and senior unsecured rating at 'AA+'. MTRC's ratings and the Stable Outlook reflect the company's strong and significant ties with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government (AA+/Stable) and MTRC's strategically important and monopoly role as Hong Kong's sole rail operator. KEY RATING DRIVERS Ratings Equalised with Government: MTRC's ratings are equalised with the Hong Kong government due to its strong linkage and high strategic importance. There is an extremely high likelihood MTRC would receive extraordinary government support, if needed. Legal Status Midrange: The Hong Kong government is MTRC's largest and controlling shareholder, with a 75.3% stake as of 10 August 2017. The government will maintain majority ownership for 20 years from the date of the IPO, which is until 2020. The Mass Transit Railway Ordinance (MTR Ordinance) grants MTRC an exclusive franchise to operate the Mass Transit Railway and the Kowloon-Canton Railway as well as to construct and operate any extension to the Mass Transit Railway for 50 years, which is until 2057. Legally speaking, the MTR Ordinance states that MTRC can be in default. Strategic Importance Stronger: MTRC is Hong Kong's sole government-owned railway operator, bearing a highly strategically important role to improve Hong Kong's public transport and implement the government's transportation blueprint. It is the sole local expert for the HKSAR government to construct the express railway linking Hong Kong to mainland China. MTRC maintained a significant market share of Hong Kong's franchised public-transport market with its continually expanding network. Its network coverage ranges from the city's key commercial and metropolitan locations to rural areas. The extensive network is strategically important to the government's objective of providing a rail-based transit network as the backbone of the domestic transport system. Integration Stronger: Integration between the HKSAR government and MTRC is strong due to the public nature of MTRC's business. The HKSAR government has repeatedly demonstrated its ability and willingness to provide tangible support to maintain MTRC's financial robustness. The forms of support and collaboration include property development rights, fare setting rights - according to a fare-adjustment mechanism agreed with government - dividend waivers and capital grants. Chinese regional governments, such as the Shenzhen municipal government, have also offered annual subsidies for 10 years to aid the operation of the Shenzhen Metro Longhua Line. Control Stronger: The government appoints MTRC's chairman and directors due to its shareholding level. The overall management of MTRC's business is vested in the board. In addition to conventional appointment processes, which are based on the government's shareholding level, the MTR Ordinance empowers the government to appoint three additional directors to the board, which only the government can remove. Strong Standalone Profile: MTRC's stable core business plus resilient property business continue to maintain its strong financial profile. Almost 23% of the company's revenue came from its Hong Kong station commercial, property rental and management businesses as of end-2016. However, overall profit declined in 2016 due to lower activity in Hong Kong's property development sector. MTRC has satisfactory leverage, but faced high capex and debt-funded special dividends in 2016 and 2017, which totalled HKD25.9 billion in two equal tranches to fund the government's Express Rail Link construction. This increased MTRC's debt/Fitch-calculated EBITDA ratio to around 2.2x in 2016, from 1.1x in 2015. We expect ongoing capex plans and property market uncertainty to further test the company's financial profile in medium term. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating action on the Hong Kong sovereign, in conjunction with continued strong government support, would result in a similar change in MTRC's ratings. A downgrade of the sovereign's rating, significant changes leading to a dilution in government ownership and control or weakening links with the government - including the strategic importance of MTRC to Hong Kong and government policy support - could trigger a rating downgrade. Any rating action on MTRC's IDR would result in similar rating action on its senior unsecured rating.

          "body": "SHANGHAI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - China\u2019s central bank has moved to restrict the issuance of negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) this year, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday, as the government intensifies its deleveraging campaign.  The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) advised banks via so-called \u201cwindow guidance\u201d to follow a new formula capping NCD issues during the year.  Applications for quotas to issue NCDs would be rejected if an applicant\u2019s interbank borrowings plus the requested amount of NCD quotas exceeded one-third of its total liabilities, the sources said.

          "body": "* Dollar index near 3-month low as U.S. bond yields capped  * U.S. private-sector posts strong job growth - report  * Emerging market currencies make big New Year gains  * Oil near highest level since mid-2015 on Iran, tighter US market  * European shares seen mixed  By Hideyuki Sano  TOKYO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Asian shares inched closer to a record high on Friday as U.S. jobs data pointed to firm economic growth although the greenback was soft as the spectre of benign inflation capped domestic bond yields.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose nearly 0.4 percent to 585.0, about one percent shy of its all-time peak of 591.5 hit in November 2007, led by gains in Australia and South Korea.  Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 0.9 percent to a 26-year high.  Spread-betters see mixed opening in Europe, with Britain\u2019s FTSE seen falling 0.1 percent and German\u2019s DAX edging up 0.1 percent.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe has risen 2.11 percent so far this week, putting it on course to log its best weekly performance since a 2.12 percent gain in mid-July.  The U.S. ADP National Employment Report on Thursday showed U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, the biggest monthly increase since March and well above economists\u2019 expectations of a rise of 190,000.  That helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average sail past the 25,000-mark for the first time. S&P 500 gained 0.40 percent while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.18 percent, both notching record closing highs.  The data also boosted expectations on Friday\u2019s payroll data by the U.S. Labor Department, where economists have forecast nonfarm job growth of 190,000 in December.  Despite signs of a strong U.S. labour market, the dollar was soft, hovering just above its three-month low against a basket of major currencies.  The dollar index stood at 91.877, near Tuesday\u2019s three-month low of 91.751.  \u201cThe dollar looks very weak at the moment. And I think the reason comes down to the fact that U.S. long-term bond yields are very low despite the Fed\u2019s rate hikes,\u201d said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.  The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 2.460 percent , below its seven-month peak of 2.504 percent touched on Dec. 21. Those levels are little different from about a year ago, even after the Fed hiked interest rates three times last year and market expectations for another three hikes in 2018.  Capping U.S. long-term bond yields were expectations that inflation will remain tame as wage growth has been slower than before the 2007-2008 financial crisis.  In that regard, average hourly earnings data due at 1330 GMT, along with payroll figures, could attract more attention, given wage growth is a key factor behind inflation trends.  Economists expect U.S. wages to have risen 2.5 percent from a year earlier in December, the same as in November.  The euro held firm at $1.2070, holding its gains so far this week of 0.6 percent and coming within sight of its 2-1/2-year peak of $1.2092 set in early September.  The euro zone\u2019s consumer inflation data, due at 1000 GMT, is expected to show an easing to 1.4 percent in December from 1.5 percent in November.  But stronger-than-expected German inflation data published late last year is fueling speculation of a higher reading, which in turn could encourage expectations the European Central Bank may move faster to wind up its stimulus.  Many emerging economy currencies have gained even more against the dollar this week as investors look for higher yields.  Since the start of 2018, the Brazilian real gained 2.4 percent, the Mexican peso 1.8 percent, the Indonesian rupiah 1.1 percent and the Indian rupee 0.7 percent.  On the other hand, the yen, which also tends to be used as a funding currency for investment in higher-yielding assets, has lost 0.3 percent against the dollar this week to 113.02 yen .  But some market players also said market moves so far this year have been mostly driven by short-term speculators and many long-term investors were on the sidelines, hampered not least by high valuations of stocks in the U.S. and some other countries.  \u201cAs far as I can see, real money investors have been cautious. So I would advise not to read too much into the new year market moves,\u201d said Kazushige Kaida, head of foreign exchange at State Street Bank in Tokyo.  In commodities markets, oil prices softened marginally but held near their highest levels since May 2015 on concerns about supply risks due to unrest in Iran and another decline in U.S. inventories as refining activity hit a 12-year high.  U.S. crude eased to $61.97 a barrel after having risen to as high as $62.21 the previous session. International benchmark Brent futures fetched $68.02.  Editing by Kim Coghill and Jacqueline Wong"

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - A boom in asset-backed securities issued by micro-lenders aiming to expand in China\u2019s fast-growing online credit market looks set to slow this year amid growing regulatory scrutiny.  Micro-lenders have raised billions of dollars packaging consumer loans into securities for sale to institutional investors on China\u2019s nascent market for asset-backed securities in order to rapidly expand their loan books.  Many of China\u2019s largest internet and technology companies have issued securities backed by micro-loans. Ant Financial  Services Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N), dominates the market and the finance arms of JD.com Inc (JD.O), Baidu Inc (BIDU.O), VIPShop Holdings (VIPS.N) and Xiaomi Technology have also raised funds through the products.   But the market for the securities is set to slow this year, industry sources say, as regulators target lenders\u2019 high debt levels and limited asset disclosure.  Rules announced on Dec. 1 limited the amount of lending backed by the products the companies can make. They were also required to consolidate them on their balance sheets.  China\u2019s exchanges and the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII) have suspended the issuance of securities backed by consumer loans by Internet-based micro-lenders, said Guo Yonggang, general manager of the structured financing department at Golden Credit Rating International Co.  NAFMII last week amended its disclosure requirements for consumer loan securities to reflect the central bank\u2019s higher transparency standards.  The volume of securities backed by consumer loans has surged over 35-fold in the last two years, with the proceeds used to finance loans to individuals looking to buy the latest iPhone or finance overseas holidays.  About 489.4 billion yuan ($75.36 billion) of the securities were issued in 2017, compared with 98.9 billion yuan in 2016, according to China Securitisation Analytics.  Repackaging the loans as asset-backed securities has allowed lenders to transfer the loans off their balance sheets, bypassing government rules stipulating how much they can lend in proportion to their equity capital.  Ant Financial is the largest issuer of consumer loan securities, accounting for 60 percent of all issues in 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on data from China Securitisation Analytics.  Its two Chongqing-based micro-loan companies had total net capital of 10.6 billion yuan, but issued 265.1 billion yuan in loans by the end of June, according to CIB Research, a unit of Industrial Bank Co (601166.SS). Outstanding loan securities issued by the two units have exceeded 250 billion yuan, it said.  \u201cThe ratio of total financing to total capital is far beyond the 2.3-times leverage requirement set by the Chongqing banking regulator,\u201d CIB Research said in a December report.  As Beijing issued its new rules, Ant Financial has quietly withdrawn plans to issue asset-backed notes worth billions of dollars, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.   Officials from the People\u2019s Bank of China have met with Ant Financial to discuss the high debt levels of its consumer finance business, said one of the sources. The source said the central bank may prevent Ant from issuing new consumer loan securities until it reduced its leverage level.  Ant said the program\u2019s cancellation was due to \u201ctight funding conditions and rising pricing on the bond market\u201d at the end of 2017.  The company plans to increase registered capital in two consumer loan units - Chongqing Mayi Micro Loans Co and Chongqing Mayi Shangcheng Small Loans Co - to 12 billion yuan, from 3.8 billion yuan at present, the company said in an email.  The central bank did not respond to a faxed request for comment.  The short history of micro-loan companies and China\u2019s asset-backed securities market raises significant challenges for ratings agencies and investors trying to gauge risk.  \u201cThe hypotheses or parameter estimations we use for data analysis could differ from the actual situation to some degree,\u201d said Zheng Kaiwen, senior analyst at China Chengxin Securities Rating Co, pointing to loan companies\u2019 short business histories.  There has yet to be a default from a consumer loan securitization product, according to China Chengxin.   But the likelihood of default may be \u201cunderestimated\u201d, said Guo of Golden Credit Rating, citing incomplete credit ratings data and the rapid expansion of consumer loans.   Before the government cleanup, small and mid-tier Chinese banks, as well as private funds with high risk tolerance, were among the most active buyers of micro loan securities, loan companies said.  In March, Bank of Jiangsu Co (600919.SS) and Debang Securities launched a 20 billion yuan investment fund focused on loan-backed securities, the first of its kind in China.  Despite government efforts to control consumer loan-backed securities, reining them in will be difficult as many transactions take place \u201coff-market\u201d, company sources said.   Those private sales take place on local financial exchanges and equity trading centers, as well as internet-based financial trading platforms powered by Chinese tech giants, making them difficult for the government to track.  Several ratings agencies and loan companies said they were unable to accurately estimate the total of such private transactions due to limited information disclosure.  Some loan companies choosing private sales have weak operating quality, aggressive strategies and incomplete risk control systems, said Guo at Golden Credit Rating.  \u201cDue to the weak information disclosure of off-market product issues, borrowers could have taken out loans from multiple platforms, or these loans could just be non-compliant campus loans or housing down-payment loans,\u201d he said.

          "title": "Wi-Fi but no water: Can smart tech help a city's poor?",
          "body": "BARCELONA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  In the picturesque Barcelona district of El Born, residents can get a better night\u2019s sleep nowadays because garbage trucks pass only when bins in the street are full, thanks to high-tech sensors that detect when they need to be emptied.  Meanwhile, a few streets away, magnetic sensors under the road surface allow drivers to find out in advance if a parking space is free - saving them time and cutting back on vehicle emissions.  Other high-technology solutions for street lamps, traffic lights and parking meters have been deployed in Spain\u2019s second-largest city in recent years.   One theater is even decked with a smart vertical garden on its outer wall, which collects its own rainwater via a solar-powered system on the roof.  As one of Europe\u2019s richest cities, most of Barcelona\u2019s inhabitants already have good access to municipal services and a high quality of life.   But in poorer parts of the world, urban experts say efforts to improve cities with cutting-edge technology can run into challenges, particularly when applied in slums.   \u201cA 24-hour smart water meter can only be possible if you\u2019re connected to the water system in the first place,\u201d said Ayona Datta, a reader in urban futures at King\u2019s College London.  In developing countries, technology may be introduced across a city to make transport or water services more efficient, but will likely only work in its richer areas, she added.  The idea of giving the same thing to everyone in both middle-class and low-income neighborhoods can be problematic, she said.  \u201cIT companies will sell (smart technology) as a package without any kind of customization at a grassroots level,\u201d she said.   Smart technology installed like this is \u201cgiving the icing on the cake to people who are already connected\u201d, Datta told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  In many cases, those who lack access to electricity or the internet cannot benefit from high-tech infrastructure, she added.   \u201cYou really need to engage with the social context (and) social issues first,\u201d she emphasized.  In India, dozens of smart cities are planned as the South Asian nation seeks ways of coping with rapid growth in its urban population.  By 2050, India will have an additional 300 million urban residents, according to UN-Habitat, the U.N. agency that deals with cities.  But one high-profile \u201csmart city\u201d strategy for Dholera, in Gujarat state, has sparked opposition.  It involves a new 920-km (572-mile) metropolis on the edge of the ancient port city, set to run mostly on solar power and intended to become a global manufacturing hub.  Critics say it will displace subsistence farmers, is at risk of inundation due to being built on a floodplain, and will cost more than planned.  \u201cA lot of smart city projects are real estate projects,\u201d said Nancy Odendaal, an associate professor of urban planning at the University of Cape Town.  \u201cOn the African continent this becomes particularly poignant as it is seen as the last frontier for property speculation and development,\u201d she added.  In most of Africa, smart cities tend to be \u201ctop-down\u201d projects to create satellite cities, like\u00a0Konza Technopolis\u00a0in Kenya and Eko Atlantic City in Nigeria, Odendaal noted.  Dubbed \u201cAfrica\u2019s Dubai\u201d, Eko Atlantic is being built on Victoria Island next to Lagos. Developers say it will become a new financial headquarters for Nigeria\u00a0as well as solving chronic housing shortages in Lagos.   Detractors argue that shiny urban centers like Eko Atlantic are designed for a wealthy elite, and do nothing to help poor communities living on their doorstep.  Elsewhere, smart city strategies have received a mixed reception.  Rwanda\u2019s capital Kigali was praised for becoming one of the first cities in Africa to roll out free wireless internet in some areas in 2013.  However, it has also been criticized for building new housing ordinary Rwandans cannot afford.  In South Africa\u2019s Cape Town, some people see smart city projects as an excuse for gentrification - \u201cjust another way of turning old neighborhoods into swish, consumer zones\u201d, said Odendaal.  Some of the most effective schemes are those that harness technology but are not marketed by governments as \u201csmart\u201d, she said.  They include Map Kibera, which began as a free, open digital map of Africa\u2019s largest slum in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. It has grown into an interactive project pinpointing local services and providing information about security in Kibera.  Its developers, Map Kibera Trust, say the initiative gives visibility to marginalized communities, with two other Nairobi slums replicating the idea.  Non-governmental groups like Slum Dwellers International (SDI) are also doing useful work at grassroots level, said Odendaal.  The network of community-based organizations representing the urban poor in 32 countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America runs a \u201cKnow Your City\u201d campaign.  Slum residents collect data and information about where they live, which is held in a central database and can be used by governments and other decision-makers.  SDI says the data is owned by the community, and gives an \u201cinformed and united\u201d voice to the urban poor.  \u201cSmart technology has very utopian intentions but it\u2019s really about how it\u2019s implemented on the ground,\u201d said Datta. \u201cIt is very universal but has to be rooted in the context of a place in order for it to work.\u201d  Community-led initiatives can function especially well, as in India where local people have started sharing photos of suspected sex offenders on instant messaging service WhatsApp, she said.  \u201cSmart technology has had all sorts of unintended consequences,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat emerges can exist completely outside of state regulation.\u201d  Reporting by Sophie Davies; editing by Megan Rowling.

          "body": "SHANGHAI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - China\u2019s primary money market rates dropped this week as demand for funds eased after peak cash demand at the end of the year.  The volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, was , about 41 basis points lower than the previous week\u2019s closing average rate of 3.0912 percent.  Liquidity conditions loosened in the first week of the new year as cash demand due to seasonal factors fell sharply, despite the central bank refraining from injecting fresh funds into the market for  The central bank has maintained that liquidity in the banking system is \u201crelatively high\u201d and is sufficient to absorb maturing reserve repos.  In open market operations, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) has drained a total of 510 billion yuan ($78.6 billion) this week, compared with a net drain of 290 billion yuan a week earlier.  Still, the respite may be short. Traders expect liquidity worries will start to resurface from the middle of this month as seasonal factors start to kick in again.  Financial institutions will have to make quarterly tax payments, required reserve payments and other regulatory payments in mid-January, which are expected to suck funds out of the market.  In addition, two batches of medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans with a total volume of 289.5 billion yuan are set to mature in January, with the first batch of 182.5 billion yuan expiring on Jan.13.  Xie Yaxuan, an analyst at China Merchants Securities, said funds released from a previously announced reduction in the targeted banks\u2019 official reserves (RRR) could partially offset the large amounts of maturing loans.  China\u2019s central bank said in late September that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for some banks by at least a 50 basis point that meet certain requirements for lending to small business and the agricultural sector, starting 2018.  In a pre-emptive move, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) also announced steps last week to reduce market jitters usually seen ahead of the long Lunar New Year holidays, which fall in mid-February this year.  The PBOC central bank will let some commercial banks temporarily keep fewer required reserves to help them cope with the heavy demand for cash ahead of the holiday, a step that analysts say does not signal any shift in its recent policy toward gradual tightening.  Separately, sources told Reuters on Thursday that China\u2019s financial authorities have published new rules to regulate bond trading, with a focus on restricting leverage and banning under-the-table deals designed to skirt regulations.

          "title": "Trafficked to India, Rohingya look for place to call home",
          "body": "NUH, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sold for $130 to work as a rag picker in the northern Indian town of Mathura, Rohingya refugee Abdul Rahman lived in a tenement of stitched together polythene bags and pined for his home and the lush farmland he owned in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state.  When he was rescued, Rahman moved to a Rohingya settlement  that he thought was the closest he could get to home, along with seven other families of rescued bonded workers who were also trafficked from a refugee camp in Bangladesh and sold in India.  \u201cBut I have no place to stay here. In Mathura, I had a roof over my head and the employer gave us food to eat,\u201d Rahman, 45, a father of four who spoke longingly of his home in Myanmar, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cThe agent had promised me a good life in India. I believed him. I was not scared when I crossed over to India,\u201d he said squatting on the floor at the settlement in Mewat, about 100 km (62 miles) south of New Delhi.  While the United Nations (U.N.) has warned that refugee camps in Bangladesh are fertile territory for human traffickers, cases of enslavement in India have only started to emerge recently with the rescue of Rohingya bonded workers.  India banned bonded labor in 1976, but it remains widespread with millions working in fields, brick kilns, brothels or as domestics to pay off debts.  Unlike Indians, who can claim cash compensation, land and housing from the government after being rescued from bondage, campaigners fear pursuing Rohingya cases as most of them entered India illegally and could face action.  In a fast-growing refugee crisis, almost 870,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar, including about 660,000 who arrived after Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants attacked security posts and the army launched a counter-offensive.  Their influx into India started years earlier, with close to 40,000 Rohingya Muslims living in the country after fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar over the last decade.  When Rahman was rescued after four years of bondage, he moved to Mewat, which has the third largest Rohingya population in India, dating back to 2013. The settlement he lives in is one of seven in the town and houses 120 families in 90 shanties.  Mewat is popular with the Rohingya because locals have given them land, said Nirmal Gorana, convener of the National Campaign Committee for Eradication of Bonded Labour, who helped rescue 13 enslaved Rohingya workers last month.  \u201cWhen we asked them where they wanted to go after their rescue, they said they wanted to be closer to their community,\u201d Gorana said.  Mewat\u2019s proximity to New Delhi is a major draw as many travel to the city and its outskirts for work.  \u201cEvery two months, more people come in,\u201d said Noor Alam, who heads the Rohingya settlement in Mewat.  \u201cThere is land to build more tenements, but then you need bamboo, plastic, ropes, cardboard - that costs nearly 7,000 rupees. But they don\u2019t have money.\u201d  Rahman was sold, along with three other trafficked Rohingya, for 25,000 rupees ($394) in Mathura. His employer deducted the money from his wages, leaving him penniless when he was rescued.  Another rescued Rohingya, Sadiq Hussain, 22, had not earned enough to pay back the 25,000 rupees his employer gave him when he started work almost four years earlier.   \u201cI still owed him 5,000 rupees when I was rescued,\u201d he said.  Hussain did not have a job or a roof over his head and feared he could not find work because his identity card, issued by the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR), was with the authorities.  The refugee card is the only proof of identity that many stateless Rohingya have to show prospective employers.  For Rohingya Muslims, their identity is a major hurdle to securing work as India is seeking legal clearance to deport them citing \u2018security threat\u2019 and links to Pakistan-based militant groups.  Rohingya refugees in India are very poor, have limited education and skills and work in low-paid, informal jobs where they are sometimes harassed and exploited, said UNHCR policy associate Ipshita Sengupta.  Dil Mohammed, a nattily dressed man in his early 20s, was one of the few Rohingya who found a regular job in a car factory in the northern city of Jammu, earning about 11,000 rupees a month. But he was asked to leave for \u201csecurity reasons\u201d.  \u201cI raised my hands and said I wasn\u2019t a terrorist, just a worker,\u201d said Mohammed, who carries UNHCR\u2019s refugee identity card wherever he goes, has learnt to speak Hindi and hopes to land an interpreter\u2019s job.  But what he shares with other Rohingya refugees is the dream to return to Myanmar, one day.  \u201cWe have no identity to claim any social benefits in India. We cannot demand citizens\u2019 rights here. We can do that only in our homeland,\u201d he said.  Reporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll; Editing by Katy Migiro.

          "title": "China December data to show economic growth slowly cooling but still solid",
          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - A blizzard of data in coming weeks is expected to show China\u2019s economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note, but activity has likely remained more resilient than expected despite a punishing crackdown on industrial pollution and a cooling property market.  A slight pullback in December industrial growth, producer inflation and investment would all reinforce consensus views that the world\u2019s second-largest economy will cool gradually in 2018, while a more marked loss of momentum may put fears of a sharper slowdown back on the table and possibly stall the government\u2019s push to reduce rising debt.  Reflecting expectations of a modest slowdown, economists see growth in industrial production easing only slightly to 6.0 percent, according to a Reuters poll, the slowest rate of expansion since early 2016 but still solid.  While Beijing\u2019s war on winter smog in northern provinces has forced some steel mills and factories to curtail output, plants elsewhere in the country may have ramped up production to gain market share, supporting nation-wide activity and keeping China\u2019s appetite for imported raw materials like iron ore relatively robust.  Sustained strength in global demand also is expected to continue to buoy China\u2019s factories in the coming year, though double-digit export growth seen in late 2017 may not be sustainable for much longer.  Likewise, new lending by Chinese banks, while easing from November, likely continued at a solid pace, capping another record year for credit even as regulators look set to extend their crackdown on riskier forms of financing such as shadow banking.  Domestic consumption is also expected to remain in hearty shape, partly offsetting some of the drag from manufacturing. Retail sales are expected to grow by just over 10 percent. Both official and private surveys this week pointed to accelerating momentum in the services sector, which now accounts for over half of the economy.  The data will culminate in fourth-quarter and full-year GDP on Jan. 18.  The economy is expected to clock growth of 6.8 percent in 2017, up slightly from the previous year, before easing to around 6.4 percent this year.       Reuters reported on Thursday that China will keep its target for economic growth at \u201caround 6.5 percent\u201d in 2018 \u2014 the same as in 2017 \u2014 as it seeks to balance efforts to reduce risks in the financial system while keeping economic growth stable.

          "body": "LIMA (Reuters) - Peru\u2019s former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori left hospital as a free man on Thursday, waving to supporters from a wheelchair and reigniting anger over a pardon he secured from President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski on Christmas Eve.  The pardon has polarized Peru, triggering anti-government protests and political resignations that have shaken Kuczynski\u2019s already-weak government. Kuczynski said last week he would unveil a new cabinet soon, but has announced no details yet.  A corrupt dictator to some and a misunderstood hero to others, Fujimori had been serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his 1990-2000 rightwing populist government.  \u201cTo the joy of many Peruvians, today Alberto Fujimori is free,\u201d his doctor, and former health minister, Alejandro Aguinaga, said on television channel Canal N, adding that Fujimori was still recovering from heart troubles.   Fujimori, 79, was trailed by police escorts and news cameras as he arrived at a sprawling house in the upscale district of La Molina in Lima, the Peruvian capital.  In a snapshot shared by his daughter on social media, Fujimori was seen in a garden surrounded by his four adult children - a sign of unity that fueled speculation he would end a political rivalry between siblings Keiko and Kenji.  Wearing a jacket and blue shirt, a smiling Fujimori appeared alert as he waved to crowds outside the Lima hospital where he had been interned for what his doctor called life-threatening blood-pressure and heart problems on the eve of the pardon.  Kuczynski, a former investment banker who is 79, like Fujimori, cited the latter\u2019s ailing health when he pardoned him nearly two weeks ago. But the decision has been widely seen in Peru as payback after Fujimori enlisted his loyalists to help Kucyznski survive an impeachment bid following a graft scandal.  \u201cYou may have benefited improperly from an illegal pardon, but that does not take away your responsibility for the death and corruption of the 1990s,\u201d said human rights activist Gisela Ortiz, whose brother, a university student, was killed in a 1992 death squad massacre Fujimori had been convicted of commanding.  Earlier on Thursday, Fujimori\u2019s supporters rallied in front of Kuczynski\u2019s house to show support for the pardon, as critics warned Kuczynski that he would be beholden to Fujimori and the rightwing party led by his children Keiko and Kenji that has an absolute majority in Congress.  Fujimori signaled from his hospital bed last week that he would not use his freedom to return to politics, but his loyalists have called for him to become an adviser to Popular Force, which controls a majority of seats in Congress.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with receiving advice from him, or counting on his support or counsel for a future presidential candidate,\u201d Popular Force lawmaker Maritza Garcia told Reuters last week. \u201cBecause of his health he can\u2019t lead the party, but he can direct it from his bed or wheelchair.\u201d  Reporting by Guadalupe Pardo and Reuters TV; Additional reporting by Marco Aquino; Writing by Mitra Taj; Editing by Clarence Fernandez"

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - The industrial city of Wuhan eased restrictions on gas use on Friday for residents facing freezing temperatures and heavy snow falls, as increased supplies offered some respite to China\u2019s winter gas shortage.  Frigid weather in northern and eastern parts of the country have stoked worries over a worsening crunch in gas supply as the government pushes millions of households and industrial plants to switch to the cleaner fuel for heating from coal.  The move by the central city of Wuhan to provide more gas for heating reflected improving supplies from state energy firms in recent weeks, although China\u2019s overall shortage persisted, said Chen Zhu, managing director with Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy.  \u201cThe heavy snow boosted the demand for heating ... but improving supplies give the state firms more space to coordinate supplies between consumers,\u201d said Chen.  \u201cThis still comes at the expense of curbs to industrial firms and gas-fired power plants,\u201d she added.  Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, will allow households to buy up to 220 cubic meters of natural gas a month, from 150 cubic meters previously, local media reported on Friday.  The city sits alongside the country\u2019s two gas trunk lines, the West-to-East project that brings in fuel from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, and the Sichuan-East China line that carries gas from the top Chinese gas basin Sichuan.   Improving gas supplies, due partly to record imports of both pipeline gas and tanker shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG), have led to a 40 percent fall in domestic LNG prices over the past 10 days or so, giving some respite to industries grappling with record fuel costs.  Gas volumes from China\u2019s largest supplier Turkmenistan have increased from late December after sliding to the lowest since December 2016 in November, according to SIA Energy\u2019s Chen.  State companies have also been diverting supplies from the south to north via pipeline grids, as well as turning to long-haul transport by trailers to increase supplies.  Sinopec said on Friday it has delivered its first truckload  of LNG to the city of Zibo in Shandong province from its Beihai terminal in the southern province of Guangxi, some 2,000 kms (1,240 miles) away.  That followed a similar effort by CNOOC, which hired a convoy of 100 trucks to move LNG from its import terminals in the south to northern regions.  China\u2019s weather bureau lifted a blizzard alert on Friday with fewer areas likely to face heavy snow, but it warned of a second wave of snow and sleet in parts of the country.

          "body": "NAIROBI, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The Kenyan currency may come under pressure next week on rising demand for dollars while Nigeria\u2019s naira and Zambia\u2019s local unit may firm.  The Kenyan shilling might come under pressure in the coming week due to increased demand for dollars from manufacturers, oil and food importers.  On Thursday, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 103.25/45 per dollar, compared with 103.10/30 at last Thursday\u2019s close.  The Ugandan shilling is seen trading with a bearish tone in the coming days, weighed down by surging appetite from manufacturing firms as they look to replenish raw material stocks after the festive season.  On Thursday commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,645/3,655, weaker than last Thursday\u2019s close of 3,625/3,635.  The naira is expected to firm slightly to 360 per dollar for investors next week as trading pick up after the Christmas holiday, traders said.  The currency traded weaker at 362 naira for investors on thin volumes on Thursday, around the same level as in the parallel market. On the official market, it was quoted at 305.95, supported by central bank\u2019s regular intervention.  The kwacha may gain marginally next week as firms convert dollars to the local unit in preparation for tax payments due next Wednesday.  Early on Friday, the currency of Africa\u2019s No.2 copper producer was at 10.1000 per dollar, down from a close of 9.9150 a week earlier, according to Reuters data.  \u201cThe supply side will be supported by corporates selling dollars to meet tax obligations,\u201d independent financial analyst Maambo Hamaundu said.  The Tanzanian shilling is seen trading in a stable range over the coming days or could weaken marginally, underpinned by subdued demand for U.S. dollars.  Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,239/2,244 to the dollar on Thursday, weaker than 2,233/2,243 a week ago.  \u201cThe shilling is expected to remain at the same levels next week, but it could weaken slightly if we see an increase in demand for dollars,\u201d said a trader at CRDB Bank.  The cedi is seen stable due to matching corporate dollar demand and supply as businesses ramp up slowly after the New Year holidays.  The local unit was trading at 4.5407 to the dollar on Thursday, same level as its 2018 open.

The win allowed the Cardinal (7-8, 1-1) to even its conference record after an opening loss to California at home last week.  Meanwhile, UCLA (11-4, 2-1) failed to take advantage of an opportunity to grab sole possession of first place in the conference after two wins over the Washington schools.  Playing its fifth consecutive home game, Stanford trailed 99-98 before Pickens, who had a dramatic game-tying hoop at the end of regulation, buried his sixth 3-pointer of the game to give the Cardinal a lead it would never relinquish.  Davis doubled the margin with his hoop in the final minute, and the Cardinal iced the victory with four free throws, the final two by Pickens, who led Stanford with 26 points.  All five Stanford starters, three of whom fouled out, scored in double figures. Davis had 22, Reid Travis 18, Michael Humphrey 14 and Kezie Okpala 13.  UCLA\u2019s Aaron Holiday, who shot 10-for-21, led all scorers with 31 points. Kris Wilkes added 18 points, Prince Ali 16 and Gyorgy Goloman 14 for the Bruins, who were seeking a fifth consecutive win.  Both the end of regulation play and the first overtime featured game-extending heroics.  Stanford trailed by as many as 13 points before rallying down the stretch of regulation, finally catching the Bruins at 85-all on a 3-pointer by Pickens with five seconds remaining.  The Cardinal held the upper hand late in the first overtime, but this time it was the Bruins\u2019 Holiday beating the buzzer with a 3-pointer that forged a 94-all tie.  Both teams finished the game short-handed. Stanford had three starters \u2014 Travis, Humphrey and Okpala \u2014 foul out, and UCLA starters Wilkes, Goloman and Thomas Welsh (eight points, 10 rebounds) also were lost to fouls.  Neither team took full advantage of its foul shots. Stanford made 22 of 32, while UCLA connected on just 19 of 35.  Travis was the game\u2019s leading rebounder with 11.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "OSLO (Reuters) - The Swedish and Norwegian currencies will strengthen significantly against the euro and dollar in 2018, building on gains seen at the start of the year, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Friday.  The two Nordic currencies sharply underperformed in 2017, with the Norwegian crown dropping over eight percent against the euro to end the year at 9.85, while analysts last January had predicted it would in fact strengthen by three percent to 8.80.  The Swedish crown also weakened despite predictions of the opposite, and economists pointed to weak housing markets in both countries as a key driver of investor anxiety.  The outlook for 2018 is nevertheless positive, and the central banks of Norway and Sweden plan to begin a gradual tightening of monetary policy after years of ultra-cheap cash, which may also contribute to currency strength.  In Norway, a recovery in the price of crude oil to the highest level since mid-2015 is also expected to spur faster growth, and the central bank recently said it plans to hike rates by the end of the year.  \u201cBoth the Swedish and Norwegian crowns are significantly weaker than fundamental factors indicate,\u201d Nordea Markets Chief Analyst Erik Bruce said, adding that the chances of a housing market collapse had been exaggerated.  In the poll, economists predicted the Norwegian crown will rise by 5.9 percent against the dollar NOK= and 5.7 percent against the euro EURNOK= over the next 12 months.  \u201cAs worries about the housing market recede, we expect the market to return focus to traditional factors like higher oil prices, a solid Norwegian economy and prospects of a rate hike from the central bank, and then the crown will strengthen,\u201d Nordea\u2019s Bruce said.  The Swedish crown was forecast to gain a little over 6 percent from current levels against the dollar SEK= and 4.3 percent against the euro EURSEK= in the course of the year.  \u201cThe Swedish crown has weakened significantly, and we don\u2019t see this as a lasting phenomenon,\u201d Bruce added.

Such schemes must not offer fixed returns to investors, and must not be used as a passive investment channel designed to skirt regulation, China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said on its website.  Beijing is taking steps this year to strengthen the regulation of local government debt as policymakers look to rein in massive debt and reduce financial risks.  The government is targeting public-private-partnership, or PPP, projects, which channel private money into infrastructure such as bridges and toll ways in the form of equity. Some PPP projects, however, are used by local governments to borrow money.  The CIRC said on Friday the new rules are aimed at preventing insurers from turning private equity investment into lending, which raises financing costs in the real economy.

          "body": "BARCELONA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  In the picturesque Barcelona district of El Born, residents can get a better night\u2019s sleep nowadays because garbage trucks pass only when bins in the street are full, thanks to high-tech sensors that detect when they need to be emptied.  Meanwhile, a few streets away, magnetic sensors under the road surface allow drivers to find out in advance if a parking space is free - saving them time and cutting back on vehicle emissions.  Other high-technology solutions for street lamps, traffic lights and parking meters have been deployed in Spain\u2019s second-largest city in recent years.   One theater is even decked with a smart vertical garden on its outer wall, which collects its own rainwater via a solar-powered system on the roof.  As one of Europe\u2019s richest cities, most of Barcelona\u2019s inhabitants already have good access to municipal services and a high quality of life.   But in poorer parts of the world, urban experts say efforts to improve cities with cutting-edge technology can run into challenges, particularly when applied in slums.   \u201cA 24-hour smart water meter can only be possible if you\u2019re connected to the water system in the first place,\u201d said Ayona Datta, a reader in urban futures at King\u2019s College London.  In developing countries, technology may be introduced across a city to make transport or water services more efficient, but will likely only work in its richer areas, she added.  The idea of giving the same thing to everyone in both middle-class and low-income neighborhoods can be problematic, she said.  \u201cIT companies will sell (smart technology) as a package without any kind of customization at a grassroots level,\u201d she said.   Smart technology installed like this is \u201cgiving the icing on the cake to people who are already connected\u201d, Datta told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  In many cases, those who lack access to electricity or the internet cannot benefit from high-tech infrastructure, she added.   \u201cYou really need to engage with the social context (and) social issues first,\u201d she emphasized.  In India, dozens of smart cities are planned as the South Asian nation seeks ways of coping with rapid growth in its urban population.  By 2050, India will have an additional 300 million urban residents, according to UN-Habitat, the U.N. agency that deals with cities.  But one high-profile \u201csmart city\u201d strategy for Dholera, in Gujarat state, has sparked opposition.  It involves a new 920-km (572-mile) metropolis on the edge of the ancient port city, set to run mostly on solar power and intended to become a global manufacturing hub.  Critics say it will displace subsistence farmers, is at risk of inundation due to being built on a floodplain, and will cost more than planned.  \u201cA lot of smart city projects are real estate projects,\u201d said Nancy Odendaal, an associate professor of urban planning at the University of Cape Town.  \u201cOn the African continent this becomes particularly poignant as it is seen as the last frontier for property speculation and development,\u201d she added.  In most of Africa, smart cities tend to be \u201ctop-down\u201d projects to create satellite cities, like\u00a0Konza Technopolis\u00a0in Kenya and Eko Atlantic City in Nigeria, Odendaal noted.  Dubbed \u201cAfrica\u2019s Dubai\u201d, Eko Atlantic is being built on Victoria Island next to Lagos. Developers say it will become a new financial headquarters for Nigeria\u00a0as well as solving chronic housing shortages in Lagos.   Detractors argue that shiny urban centers like Eko Atlantic are designed for a wealthy elite, and do nothing to help poor communities living on their doorstep.  Elsewhere, smart city strategies have received a mixed reception.  Rwanda\u2019s capital Kigali was praised for becoming one of the first cities in Africa to roll out free wireless internet in some areas in 2013.  However, it has also been criticized for building new housing ordinary Rwandans cannot afford.  In South Africa\u2019s Cape Town, some people see smart city projects as an excuse for gentrification - \u201cjust another way of turning old neighborhoods into swish, consumer zones\u201d, said Odendaal.  Some of the most effective schemes are those that harness technology but are not marketed by governments as \u201csmart\u201d, she said.  They include Map Kibera, which began as a free, open digital map of Africa\u2019s largest slum in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. It has grown into an interactive project pinpointing local services and providing information about security in Kibera.  Its developers, Map Kibera Trust, say the initiative gives visibility to marginalized communities, with two other Nairobi slums replicating the idea.  Non-governmental groups like Slum Dwellers International (SDI) are also doing useful work at grassroots level, said Odendaal.  The network of community-based organizations representing the urban poor in 32 countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America runs a \u201cKnow Your City\u201d campaign.  Slum residents collect data and information about where they live, which is held in a central database and can be used by governments and other decision-makers.  SDI says the data is owned by the community, and gives an \u201cinformed and united\u201d voice to the urban poor.  \u201cSmart technology has very utopian intentions but it\u2019s really about how it\u2019s implemented on the ground,\u201d said Datta. \u201cIt is very universal but has to be rooted in the context of a place in order for it to work.\u201d  Community-led initiatives can function especially well, as in India where local people have started sharing photos of suspected sex offenders on instant messaging service WhatsApp, she said.  \u201cSmart technology has had all sorts of unintended consequences,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat emerges can exist completely outside of state regulation.\u201d  Reporting by Sophie Davies; editing by Megan Rowling.

          "body": "(Corrects third graf to say sixth week instead of session)  By Chris Thomas  Jan 5 (Reuters) - Australian shares hit a fresh 10-year high on Friday and were set to finish the first week of 2018 in the black, as financials and mining stocks rallied on strong global cues and firm oil prices.  The S&P/ASX 200 index rose as much as 0.6 percent to 6,114.4, its highest since January 2008, after closing marginally higher in the previous session.  The index is on track to finish firmer for its sixth week in seven.  Major stock indexes around the world hit record highs on Thursday, boosted by solid data from the world\u2019s largest economies, with the Dow industrials breaking above the 25,000 level for the first time.  \u201cWhile a little cautious about reading too much into movements over late-December and early-January, the background leading into the period from an economic perspective looks pretty solid,\u201d said Damien Hennessy, co-founder of Heuristic Investment Systems.  Banking stocks accounted for most of the gains on the Australian benchmark index, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia advancing 1 percent to its highest in more than three weeks.  Other \u201cBig Four\u201d banks rose between 0.6 percent and 1.1 percent.  Miners also enjoyed some gains on the back of robust metal and oil prices. BHP Billiton was among the biggest boosts to the index, climbing 1.2 percent to its highest since May, 2015.  BHP is on track for its ninth straight positive session, and will likely finish the first week of the new year up more than 3 percent.  South32 Ltd posted a 2.5 percent gain, touching its highest in over nine weeks.  \u201cGrowth has been hard to come by domestically ... global cyclical exposures have provided some access to growth,\u201d said Hennessy.  Oil rose to its highest since May, 2015, on concerns that unrest in Iran and another decline in U.S. inventories could hit supply.  New Zealand\u2019s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index drew back from record highs hit in the previous session to fall 0.3 percent, its biggest intraday percentage drop since mid-December.  The index is, however, headed for an eighth straight weekly gain.  Telecom stocks dominated the losses, with Spark New Zealand Ltd slipping 1.6 percent to a four-week trough.

          "body": "EditorsNote: fixes to \u201c(12-2-1)\u201d in fourth graf  Paul Byron scored in a shootout Thursday night as the Montreal Canadiens snapped a five-game losing streak with a 2-1 win over the visiting Tampa Bay Lightning at Bell Centre.  Byron opened the shootout with the only goal of the session. Goalie Carey Price stopped all three Lightning shots he faced to preserve the victory.  Max Pacioretty scored in the second period for the Canadiens (17-20-4), who scored two goals or fewer for the sixth consecutive game. Price recorded 44 saves in regulation and overtime.  Nikita Kucherov scored in the second period for the NHL-leading Lightning (29-8-3), who lost for just the third time in 15 games (12-2-1) since Dec. 1. Goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy recorded 37 saves in regulation and overtime.  With the win, the Canadiens evened the season series between the teams at a game apiece with two games to play.  After a scoreless first period, the teams traded goals in the first 64 seconds of the second.  A turnover deep in the Lightning zone led to Pacioretty\u2019s goal just 20 seconds into the period. Tampa Bay defenseman Mikhail Sergachev tried to make a no-look clearing pass, but Pacioretty swooped in for the interception, descended upon Vasilevskiy and fired a shot into the net as Lightning defenseman Anton Stralman tried to slide into the path of the puck.  An impressive individual effort by Kucherov tied the game just 44 seconds later. Kucherov outraced teammate Steven Stamkos and Canadiens defenseman Karl Alzner to a loose puck along the boards to the left of the Canadiens\u2019 net. He then skated to the top of the faceoff circles and fired a shot that threaded a gaggle of players in front of the net and sailed under the legs of Price.  The Lightning had a 5-2 shot advantage in overtime but couldn\u2019t beat Price.  The Canadiens continue a five-game homestand Sunday when they host the Vancouver Canucks. The Lightning play the fourth game of a five-game road trip Saturday when they visit the Ottawa Senators.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong\u2019s legal chief, whose watch was marked by instances of perceived interference by China in the city\u2019s rule of law, stepped down on Friday, more than four years before the end of his term.  An independent legal system sits at the core of the wide-ranging autonomy promised after Britain handed its former colony back to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees it freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen had resigned for personal reasons, after starting his second five-year term in July.  \u201cHe has been a pillar of strength in upholding the rule of law in Hong Kong,\u201d Lam said.  But Yuen\u2019s time in office was punctuated by several controversies, including two rare protests by hundreds of lawyers.  Yuen, 53, was one of the key officials tasked with promoting a contentious political reform package in 2014, which later helped trigger the months-long \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d street protests demanding, in vain, full democracy for the city.  He was targeted by demonstrators after reports last year that he had overruled several senior public prosecutors to seek jail terms for three democrats involved in those protests, including Joshua Wong, the bespectacled young activist who became the public face of the demonstrations.  He was also criticized for pushing through an immigration arrangement that would allow Chinese officials to implement mainland laws inside a downtown high-speed railway station.  Yuen and Communist Party officials in Beijing argued that parts of the station would be legally regarded as \u201cmainland Chinese territory\u201d, so the city\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which explicitly says national laws don\u2019t apply in Hong Kong, would not be applicable.   The Hong Kong Bar Association called Beijing\u2019s move \u201cthe most retrograde step to date in the implementation of the Basic Law\u201d.  On each occasion, \u201cthe ultimate decision was made in accordance with the law\u201d, Yuen said on Friday, even though some people might not like the results.  Yuen also reportedly tried to dissuade Beijing from interfering in a court case against pro-independence lawmakers last year, and spoke openly about how \u201cmatters that can be properly handled within Hong Kong\u2019s legal or judicial system should be left to be dealt with at the Hong Kong level as much as possible\u201d.

That prompted 2,000 lawyers to march in protest against what they said was the most blatant interference in the city\u2019s judicial independence.  Incoming Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng, 59, said her \u201cprime mission\u201d would be to uphold the rule of law and that she would pursue criminal prosecutions \u201cwithout any interference\u201d.

Stastny found the puck at the left post during a scramble around goalie Marc-Andre Fleury and poked it across the goal line before Fleury could find it. It was the eighth goal for Stastny this season and helped St. Louis up its record to 26-15-2.  It was the first regulation loss for the Golden Knights (27-10-2) since a 7-4 setback Dec. 1 in Winnipeg. Vegas still leads the Pacific Division by three points over Los Angeles. The Blues leaped over idle Winnipeg for first place in the Central Division.  St. Louis came out on the attack from the outset, netting the first goal at 9:35 of the first period. Alexander Steen\u2019s wrister from the top of the right circle made its way through traffic and beat Fleury to the glove side for Steen\u2019s fifth marker of the season. Brayden Schenn and Colton Parayko drew assists.  The Golden Knights equalized at 9:23 of the second period. After former Blue David Perron won a puck battle in the left corner, he passed to James Neal, who backhanded a feed to Erik Haula just above the left circle. Haula snapped a wrister past Carter Hutton for his 15th goal, tying his career high.  That was all that got past Hutton (8-3-0), who started and won his third straight game in place of starter Jake Allen. Hutton entered the game with a .944 save percentage and did nothing to hurt that, stopping 32 of 33 shots.  Fleury (8-2-1) didn\u2019t exactly shame himself in defeat, making 37 saves and giving Vegas a chance to steal two points on a rare night when it didn\u2019t carry the play.  The Golden Knights pulled Fleury for a sixth attacker with two minutes left, but Hutton stood tall. He stoned Neal on a point-blank chance at the right post in the final minute.  \u2014Field Level Media"

The U.S. private equity firm is betting on cost savings and a pick-up in consumer sentiment with its mid-summer buyout of the struggling firm, allowing it to bring brands such as RVCA, Element and Von Zipper into a portfolio already including Quicksilver, Roxy and DC Shoes.

          "title": "Cold comfort: China's Wuhan eases gas rationing as snow hits",
          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - The industrial city of Wuhan eased restrictions on gas use on Friday for residents facing freezing temperatures and heavy snow falls, as increased supplies offered some respite to China\u2019s winter gas shortage.  Frigid weather in northern and eastern parts of the country have stoked worries over a worsening crunch in gas supply as the government pushes millions of households and industrial plants to switch to the cleaner fuel for heating from coal.  The move by the central city of Wuhan to provide more gas for heating reflected improving supplies from state energy firms in recent weeks, although China\u2019s overall shortage persisted, said Chen Zhu, managing director with Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy.  \u201cThe heavy snow boosted the demand for heating ... but improving supplies give the state firms more space to coordinate supplies between consumers,\u201d said Chen.  \u201cThis still comes at the expense of curbs to industrial firms and gas-fired power plants,\u201d she added.  Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, will allow households to buy up to 220 cubic meters of natural gas a month, from 150 cubic meters previously, local media reported on Friday.  The city sits alongside the country\u2019s two gas trunk lines, the West-to-East project that brings in fuel from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, and the Sichuan-East China line that carries gas from the top Chinese gas basin Sichuan.   Improving gas supplies, due partly to record imports of both pipeline gas and tanker shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG), have led to a 40 percent fall in domestic LNG prices over the past 10 days or so, giving some respite to industries grappling with record fuel costs.  Gas volumes from China\u2019s largest supplier Turkmenistan have increased from late December after sliding to the lowest since December 2016 in November, according to SIA Energy\u2019s Chen.  State companies have also been diverting supplies from the south to north via pipeline grids, as well as turning to long-haul transport by trailers to increase supplies.  Sinopec said on Friday it has delivered its first truckload  of LNG to the city of Zibo in Shandong province from its Beihai terminal in the southern province of Guangxi, some 2,000 kms (1,240 miles) away.  That followed a similar effort by CNOOC, which hired a convoy of 100 trucks to move LNG from its import terminals in the south to northern regions.  China\u2019s weather bureau lifted a blizzard alert on Friday with fewer areas likely to face heavy snow, but it warned of a second wave of snow and sleet in parts of the country.

          "body": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China\u2019s insurance regulator issued a notice on Friday banning insurers\u2019 asset management arms from using private equity investment schemes as a channel to increase local government debts.  Such schemes must not offer fixed returns to investors, and must not be used as a passive investment channel designed to skirt regulation, China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said on its website.  Beijing is taking steps this year to strengthen the regulation of local government debt as policymakers look to rein in massive debt and reduce financial risks.  The government is targeting public-private-partnership, or PPP, projects, which channel private money into infrastructure such as bridges and toll ways in the form of equity. Some PPP projects, however, are used by local governments to borrow money.  The CIRC said on Friday the new rules are aimed at preventing insurers from turning private equity investment into lending, which raises financing costs in the real economy.  The regulator also said schemes should not be used to increase local governments\u2019 liabilities.  Reporting by Beijing Newsroom, Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Sam Holmes"

Frigid weather in northern parts of the country have stoked worries over a crunch in gas supply as the government pushes millions of households and industrial plants to switch to the cleaner fuel for heating from coal.  But, Chen Zhu, managing director with Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy, said the move by the central city of Wuhan reflected improving supplies from dominant state energy firms in recent weeks, although she noted that the overall supply shortage remained.  \u201cThe heavy snow boosted the demand for heating ... but improving supplies give the state firms more space to coordinate supplies between consumers,\u201d said Chen.  \u201cThis still comes at the expense of curbs to industrial firms and gas-fired power plants.\u201d  Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, is allowing households to purchase a maximum 220 cubic metres of natural gas per month, up from 150 cubic metres previously, local media reported on Friday.  Improving gas supplies, partially due to record imports of both pipeline gas and tanker shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG), have led to a 40-percent fall in domestic LNG prices over the past 10 days or so, giving some respite to industries grappling with record fuel costs.

At least 70 people were arrested in the state of Mexico on Thursday after looting in two cities, a spokesman for state police said.  At least 800 police were deployed to deter looting at stores in the state, according to a Twitter post by state police.   In the state of Veracruz, two people were arrested for using social media to incite looting in a suburb of the port capital, media reported.   Mexico\u2019s government on Wednesday denounced forecast price rises by fuel retailers and tortilla makers, saying increases were unjustified as it sought to allay public concern about high inflation at the start of a presidential election year.  As inflation hovers near a 16-year high just below 7 percent, officials insisted the forecast price spikes, which have triggered social media outrage and threats of protests, are not warranted.  Early last year, Mexico saw violent protests and looting after the government cut subsidies to gasoline prices as it moved toward a free market from a state-controlled regime.  Mexican authorities have insisted that price increases in recent months have been modest, noting gasoline prices have only risen 1.3 percent compared to average prices at the end of November.

          "body": "* Nonfarm payrolls forecast to rise by 190,000 in December  * Unemployment rate seen unchanged at 4.1 percent  * Average hourly earnings expected to rise 0.3 percent  By Lucia Mutikani  WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - U.S. employers likely maintained a brisk pace of hiring in December while increasing wages for workers amid growing confidence in the economy, which could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in March.  Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 190,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after a gain of 228,000 in November. Despite the anticipated moderation, employment gains would still be above the monthly average of 170,000 over the past three months.  Harsh weather in some parts of the country likely contributed to some of the job growth slowdown in December.  For all of 2017, the economy is expected to have created around 2 million jobs, slightly below the 2.2 million added in 2016. The Labor Department is due to release its closely watched employment report at 8:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT) on Friday.  Job growth surged in October and November after being held back in September by back-to-back hurricanes, which destroyed infrastructure and homes and temporarily dislocated some workers in Texas and Florida. A solid employment report would add to the upbeat assessment of the economy signaled in housing, consumer spending and manufacturing data.  \u201cFed officials continue to look for signs that the U.S. economy remains on the expansion path, December\u2019s employment report should further support such an outlook,\u201d said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. \u201cWe believe the Fed will be in a position to raise rates in March.\u201d  Job growth in line with expectations could heighten criticism of a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.  The fiscal stimulus, which includes a sharp reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, is occurring with the economy operating almost at capacity. There are concerns the economy could overheat.  \u201cWith the tax cuts we get solid GDP growth in the near-term and then a fiscal hangover, which will likely put the economy at a greater risk of recession,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.  Economists expect job growth to slow this year as the labor market hits full employment, which will likely boost wage growth as employers compete for workers. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.  Average hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0.3 percent in December after gaining 0.2 percent in the prior month. So-called base effects are expected to, however, keep the annual increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Economists are optimistic that annual wage growth will top 3.0 percent by the end of this year.  The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. With the December employment report, the Labor Department will incorporate annual revisions to the seasonally adjusted household survey data going back five years.  The unemployment rate is derived from the household survey, which means the series is likely to be revised. The jobless rate has declined by seven-tenths of a percentage point since last January.  Economists believe it could drop to 3.5 percent by the end of this year. That could potentially unleash a faster pace of wage growth and translate into a much stronger increase in inflation than currently anticipated.  That, according to economists, would force the Fed to push through four interest rate increases this year instead of the three it has penciled in. The U.S. central bank raised borrowing costs three times in 2017.  \u201cIf the unemployment rate declines and wages rise faster, which is likely, the Fed is going to start worrying about wage inflation,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  Employment gains were likely broad in December, mirroring the pattern of the previous two months. Construction payrolls probably increased further, reflecting recent strong increases in homebuilding.  Another month of steady gains is expected in manufacturing employment. A strong holiday shopping season likely boosted retail payrolls in December.  Macy\u2019s Inc said last month it would hire an additional 7,000 temporary workers for its stores to deal with heavy customer traffic in the run-up to the holiday shopping season.
