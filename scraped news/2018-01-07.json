          "title": "Cambodia marks 39 years since fall of brutal 'killing fields' regime",
          "body": "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Thousands of Cambodian survivors of the Khmer Rouge on Sunday marked 39 years since the fall of the brutal regime that killed an estimated 1.7 million people.  Up to 40,000 people attended an event in the capital Phnom Penh, organized by the ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party (CPP) of Prime Minister Hun Sen, installed by the Vietnamese who invaded Cambodia on January 7, 1979 and put and end to the regime.  \u201cThe January 7 victory saved the lives of people who survived the killings and brought back to the Cambodian people rights lost under the regime of Pol Pot,\u201d Hun Sen said at the ceremony.  Most of the victims of the regime died of torture, starvation, exhaustion or disease in labor camps or were beaten to death during mass executions in the \u201ckilling fields\u201d.  The day is controversial in Cambodia, with Hun Sen\u2019s party celebrating it as a day of liberation while others mourn it as the start of a 10-year occupation by their hated Vietnamese neighbors.  The rise and fall of the genocidal Khmer Rouge was initiated by Vietnam to \u201cdivide and weaken\u201d Cambodia to keep it under Vietnamese control, former opposition leader Sam Rainsy said in a post on his Facebook page.      The day marks Cambodia\u2019s journey toward a brighter future, the United States said.  \u201cWe also celebrate the ingenuity, courage, and perseverance with which the Cambodian people have emerged from this period of darkness, rebuilt their country, and carried forward the process of national reconciliation,\u201d the U.S. embassy said in a statement.  The anniversary comes amid an opposition crackdown by Hun Sen\u2019s government ahead of a July general election.  The United States and the European Union withdrew support for the vote following the dissolution of the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party last year but China, Cambodia\u2019s biggest foreign backer, said on Thursday it believes the election this year will be fair.  Pol Pot\u2019s three top surviving henchmen are serving life sentences on convictions by a joint Cambodian-United Nations tribunal for various crimes, including crimes against humanity.   Those in custody are former Khmer Rouge S-21 prison chief Kaing Guek Eav, \u2018Brother Number Two\u2019 Nuon Chea and former President Khieu Samphan.

          "body": "Carl Soderberg scored twice Saturday night for the Colorado Avalanche, who remained red-hot with a 7-2 win over the Minnesota Wild at Pepsi Center in Denver.  Gabriel Bourque, Patrik Nemeth, Mikko Rantanen, Nathan MacKinnon and Tyson Jost scored a goal apiece for the Avalanche, who matched their season-high scoring total. Colorado (22-16-3) has won five straight to move into a tie with the Wild and the Anaheim Ducks for the final Western Conference wild-card spot.  Avalanche goalie Jonathan Bernier made 34 saves.  Eric Staal scored both goals for the Wild, who had a two-game winning streak snapped. Goalie Devan Dubnyk saved 26 of the 32 shots he faced before being pulled in the third period. Alex Stalock made five saves in relief, yielding one goal.  The Avalanche took the lead 7:38 into the first, when Bourque took a pass from Colin Wilson at the left faceoff circle and fired the puck past Dubnyk.  Nemeth doubled the lead following a chaotic sequence with 1:54 remaining in the opening period. MacKinnon corralled a loose puck following a shot by Rantanen and dished to Nemeth, whose shot pinged off the right post and into the net.  The Wild (22-17-3) cut the gap in half with 33 seconds left in the first. Staal rebounded a shot by Jonas Brodin and fired the put-back between MacKinnon and defenseman Erik Johnson.  The Avalanche extended its lead to 3-1 on a power play goal 8:03 into the second. Alexander Kerfoot\u2019s pass from just behind the net went through the legs of Minnesota defenseman Matt Dumba and to Soderberg, who beat Dubnyk from point-blank range.  Rantanen capped a flurry in front of the net with 3:41 remaining in the second. After MacKinnon and Gabriel Landeskog combined for three shots on Dubnyk, Rantanen pounced on a loose puck and tucked it into the left corner of the net.  Staal scored another last-minute goal with 38 seconds left in the period, but Soderberg and MacKinnon ended any hopes of a Wild comeback by scoring 2:04 apart in the third. Jost provided the final goal with 2:14 left.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Senior power forward Johnathan Williams scored 30 points on 13-of-18 shooting, and No. 19 Gonzaga exploded in the second half to record an 85-66 victory over Loyola Marymount on Saturday night in West Coast Conference play at Los Angeles.  Junior guard Josh Perkins registered 12 points and 10 assists and freshman guard Zach Norvell Jr. (12) and sophomore forward Rui Hachimura (11) also scored in double digits for the Bulldogs (14-3, 4-0 WCC). Williams added 10 rebounds, Perkins had 10 assists, and Norvell grabbed nine boards.  Gonzaga led by just five points at halftime but began the second half with 17 in a row en route to defeating Loyola Marymount for the 17th consecutive time.  Senior wing Steven Haney made five 3-point baskets and scored 18 of his 22 points in the first half for the Lions (5-10, 0-4). Junior guard James Batemon added 13 points and eight assists for the Loyola Marymount, which has dropped six straight games and eight of the past nine.  The Bulldogs shot 55.7 percent from the field and had a 48-26 edge in points in the paint while improving to 38-3 vs. the Lions during coach Mark Few\u2019s 19 seasons at the school.  Loyola Marymount was 8 of 14 from 3-point range in the first half to trail 46-41 at the break.  However, Williams and the Bulldogs were a different team after intermission. Williams began the half with a layup and scored six overall during the half-opening 17-0 run.  Norvell converted a three-point play to cap the spurt and make it 63-41 with 15:37 remaining.  A dunk by Williams made it 68-43 with 13:39 left, and the lead was 23 just past the midway point of the half. The Lions used a 15-5 run over a 7 1/2-minute stretch to creep within 13 before Gonzaga closed it out.  The Lions were just 1 of 9 from 3-point range in the second half to finish 9 of 23.  Haney\u2019s long-range shooting in the first half helped the Lions stay within range. The five 3-pointers raised his career total to 174, tying Jim Williamson (1993-97) for fifth place on the school\u2019s all-time list.  A 9-0 run that culminated with Williams\u2019 layup gave Gonzaga a 34-20 lead. Williams later made a dunk to make it 43-30 before Loyola Marymount closed the half on an 11-3 run.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Mika Zibanejad scored the lone goal in a shootout, and goalie Henrik Lundqvist was perfect against all three Arizona shooters he faced as the New York Rangers claimed a 2-1 shootout win over the Coyotes on Saturday night in Glendale, Ariz.  Lundqvist denied offerings from Anthony Duclair, Clayton Keller and Derek Stepan in the shootout and also made 38 saves through regulation and overtime at the Gila River Arena to earn the 424th victory in his career.  Lundqvist moved ahead of Tony Esposito for sole possession of eighth place on the NHL\u2019s all-time list for wins by a goalie.  The Rangers (22-14-5) won despite being without leading scorer Mats Zuccarello, who missed the game due to illness. New York produced a comeback effort against an Arizona club that sits last in the league standings and has now lost the last nine meetings between the teams.  Duclair opened the scoring for the Coyotes just past the midway point of the first period with a power-play marker when he pounced on a loose puck during a scramble and slipped a shot past Lundqvist.  It was the ninth goal of the season for Duclair, who is enjoying a bounce-back season after a miserable 2015-16 campaign in which he scored only five times.  Jimmy Vesey replied for the Rangers 5:11 into the second period, first stealing the puck from star defender Oliver Ekman-Larsson, then driving to the net and lifting a short-side effort past Coyotes goalie Antti Raanta.  Raanta, who was traded to Arizona last summer after two seasons with the Rangers in which he served as Lundqvist\u2019s backup, made 24 saves for the Coyotes (10-27-6).  Arizona received some good news, as forward Brad Richardson returned after missing four games due to injury.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Graham went 8-for-8 from the foul line over the final 2:02 as TCU went on a late charge. Marcus Garrett got a steal and gave Kansas (12-3, 2-1 Big 12) the lead for good at 79-77 thanks to two free throws with 3:01 left.  Graham capped his free surge by sinking two with 11.3 seconds left for an 87-82 lead. Malik Newman clinched the victory on a free throw with four seconds remaining that put the Jayhawks up 88-84.  Kansas was trying to rebound from an 85-73 loss to Texas Tech on Tuesday but needed to hold off TCU (13-2, 1-2) in the second half.  The Horned Frogs bounced back from a 14-point, first-half deficit and took the lead by one a few times in the second half before Graham and the Jayhawks finished them off.  The Jayhawks actually had three double-figure scorers \u2014 Graham, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and Udoka Azubuike \u2014 by halftime. Mykhailiuk finished with 20, and Azubuike had 14 before fouling out late.  Mitch Lightfoot came off the bench to give Kansas help in several ways. He scored nine points, grabbed seven rebounds and made six blocks.  TCU was trying to beat a Top 10 team for the first time in five years Before Saturday, the Horned Frogs\u2019 only loss of the season was on Dec. 30 against Oklahoma, 90-89.  Graham sparked the 16-2 first-half run that gave the Jayhawks an early 22-8 lead. The guard scored seven points during that stretch.  That run was a big reason why Kansas held a 42-34 halftime lead. The Jayhawks shot 58 percent from the floor before the break while TCU could not find the range.  The Horned Frogs made just 34 percent in the first half but played much better in the final 20 minutes, finishing at 39.1 percent. Vladimir Brodziansky led TCU with 20 points, and Jaylen Fisher added 16.  Kansas shot 50.9 percent from the field overall.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Tyler Bozek scored the game-tying goal in the third period and then netted the winner in a shootout as the Toronto Maple Leafs erased a two-goal deficit and beat the Vancouver Canucks 3-2 Saturday night in Toronto.  Bozek, the third and final shooter for the Maple Leafs, notched the game-winning tally by wristing a shot past the glove of Vancouver goalie Jacob Markstrom. Toronto goalie Frederik Andersen subsequently closed the door on Thomas Vanek\u2019s effort, ending the shootout.  The Maple Leafs (25-16-2) trailed by a 2-0 count as the third period neared the midway point, but they found their offense just in time before the Air Canada Centre faithful.  Auston Matthews cued the comeback just a couple of minutes after the visitors made it a two-goal game when he finished a perfectly executed two-on-one rush with Zach Hyman by tucking a shot just inside the post at 8:23.  Bozek then converted his own rebound at 12:37 on a partial breakaway to even the game at 2-2 and force extra time.  The game also featured the NHL debut for Toronto defenseman Travis Dermott, a 2015 second-round draft pick who collected an assist in his first big-league game.  The loss, even if it came with a point in the standings, was the third straight for the Canucks (16-19-6). Vancouver has just two wins in its past 13 outings after letting one get away Saturday.  After a scoreless first period, Brock Boeser \u2014 who leads all NHL rookies in goals and points \u2014 opened the scoring early in the second period by ripping a short-side offering past Andersen for his 22nd goal of the season.  Sam Gagner doubled the Vancouver lead at 6:34 of the third period with a power-play goal during a five-on-three advantage.  Boeser thought he scored early in overtime when he ripped a shot that beat Andersen, but video replay showed it rang off both posts but didn\u2019t cross the line.  Andersen and Markstrom were each credited with 34 saves.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "AUCKLAND (Reuters) - World number 14 Julia Goerges won her third successive tournament as she blasted her way to a 6-4 7-6(4) victory over Caroline Wozniacki to seal the Auckland Classic title on Sunday.  Goerges was rarely troubled by the world number three as she used a powerful service and blistering forehands that kept the Dane pinned deep and unable to extend rallies beyond a few shots.  The 29-year-old German, who has played at the Auckland tournament every year since her first visit in 2010, extended her winning streak to 14-matches stretching back to last year when she won in Moscow and then the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai.  \u201cIt feels amazing, but it\u2019s not just about winning here but about my consistency over the last few months,\u201d Goerges said after she became the first woman to be presented with a korowai, or Maori feather cloak, that will be awarded to every subsequent winner.  \u201cI have become much more mature, that\u2019s thanks to my team who have really changed my brain.\u201d  Bad weather throughout the week wreaked havoc with the schedule in New Zealand\u2019s largest city and both had been required to play their quarter-finals and semi-finals on Saturday.  Both players had made the final at the Auckland Tennis Centre before, with the German losing to Sloane Stephens in 2016, while Wozniacki lost to Venus Williams in 2015.  Goerges however stamped her intentions on the opening point when she smashed a forehand service return back at Wozniacki\u2019s feet and broke to take a 1-0 lead that she never relinquished.  She sealed the first set after 35 minutes with her seventh ace and then broke Wozniacki again in the first game of the second set and continued to just overpower the Dane.  Wozniacki had an opportunity to get back on serve in the fourth game when she had a break point but Goerges simply pulled out another ace and consolidated her lead.  The Dane, however, was finally getting into the match and while she blew her second break point two games later she finally broke in the eighth to get back on serve and then took a 5-4 lead.  That was the only chance she had, however, as Goerges forced a tiebreak and then raced through it to seal the title after 91 minutes with another forehand winner.  \u201cI have got a lot of matches under my belt and it was the type of preparation I hoped for,\u201d Wozniacki said as she looked ahead to the Australian Open from Jan. 15-28.  \u201cHopefully it will be a great couple of weeks.\u201d  Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty"

The Timberwolves (25-16) won the two previous meetings, both of which were played in New Orleans, by scores of 108-94 (Nov. 1) and 120-102 (Nov. 29). They host Cleveland on Monday.  The Pelicans (19-19) had won their last three road games by a combined 39 points. They return home to face Detroit on Monday.  Jimmy Butler matched Towns\u2019 21 points and added eight assists as six Minnesota players scored in double figures. Andrew Wiggins scored 20 points, Taj Gibson had 15, Gorgui Dieng came off the bench to score 14 and Tyus Jones had 10.  DeMarcus Cousins led New Orleans with 23 points and 15 rebounds, Anthony Davis had 16 points, Jrue Holiday scored 13 and Rajon Rondo finished with 10.  The Timberwolves made 9 of 18 3-pointers as Towns was 3-for-3 and Butler and Dieng were both 2-for-2. The Pelicans made 6 of 29 from outsideas, with Holiday going 0-for-6 and E\u2019Twaun Moore shooting 0-for-4.  Both teams were exceptional at the foul line. New Orleans made 26 of 28 free throws and Minnesota made 19 of 21.  Minnesota had a 21-point halftime lead and started the third quarter with a 12-4 spurt that gave it an 81-52 lead.  The Timberwolves led by as many as 34 points before settling for a 98-71 cushion after three quarters.  The Pelicans gradually made the final margin more respectable, but got no closer than 16 points during the fourth quarter.  Wiggins scored nine points and Gibson had eight as the Timberwolves raced to a 36-24 lead after one quarter.  Cousins had an assist and four points as the Pelicans cut the lead to 38-30, but Towns scored seven points as Minnesota followed with a 21-8 run.  Davis made consecutive baskets before a 10-0 run gave the Wolves their largest lead to that point at 69-42.  New Orleans scored the final six points of the half, but Minnesota held a 69-48 halftime lead.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Six players scored in double figures for N.C. State (11-5 overall, 1-2 ACC), with Omer Yurtseven and Torin Dorn leading the way with 16 points apiece.  Allerik Freeman tallied 15 points, Braxton Beverly added 14, Lennard Freeman had 13 and Abdul-Malik Abu posted 10. The Wolfpack knocked off Duke for the second year in a row.  The latest outcome was pretty much secured with Dorn\u2019s four-point play at the 1:06 mark, pushing the lead to 91-80. N.C. State was playing its conference home opener after beginning with two ACC road games for the first time in a decade.  It was an incredible turnaround for the Wolfpack, who three nights earlier dropped a 30-point decision at Notre Dame.  Marvin Bagley III poured in 31 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for Duke (13-2, 1-2). Trevon Duval\u2019s 18 points, Gary Trent Jr.\u2019s 13 and Wendell Carter Jr.\u2019s 11 also helped the Blue Devils, who became the second No. 2-ranked team to lose to the Wolfpack this season.  In November, N.C. State toppled then-No. 2 Arizona.  Yurtseven scored the last four points of the first half to put the Wolfpack on top 43-41 at the break. He had 14 points less than four minutes into the second half, setting a career high for an ACC game for the sophomore center. He was tagged with his fourth foul with 8:20 to play, then slightly more than a minute later, Abu picked up his fourth also.  That didn\u2019t bother the Wolfpack, who had a 75-66 edge with less than seven minutes to play.  Yurtseven fouled out with 2:24 remaining.  Duke shot 53.1 percent in the first half, but committed nine turnovers during that span and finished with 16 giveaways.  The Wolfpack opened the second half by making 11 of its first 17 shots and grabbing offensive rebounds on three of the misses.  \u2014Field Level Media"

In this game, Stone finished with his big goal and two assists while teammate Erik Karlsson added three helpers - two in the three-goal third period. Dzingel finished with two goals.  The Lightning kept goalie Craig Anderson busy. Anderson made 45 saves as Tampa Bay outshot Ottawa 48-33.  Despite the loss, Tampa Bay (29-9-3) remains on top of the Atlantic Division as well as the NHL with 61 points. The Lightning had numerous chances but converted just one of five power plays and were hurt by some turnovers.  Ottawa started fast on Saturday, scoring the game\u2019s first three goals for a 3-0 lead after one.  Dzingel and Duchene scored 63 seconds apart for a 2-0 lead at 5:51, and Zack Smith made it 3-0 later in the period as he beat goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy.  However, the second period belonged to Tampa Bay.  The Lightning struck quickly in that period as Victor Hedman scored 26 seconds in, and Slater Koekkok added another goal just 1:15 after that, reducing Ottawa\u2019s lead to 3-2. Yanni Gourde tied it with 4:03 left in the period by tipping a Mikhail Sergachev blast past Anderson.  Tampa Bay finished the period with 20 shots, the three goals, and seemingly turned the game\u2019s momentum around. The Lightning also dominated the first part of the third period but Ottawa kept Tampa Bay off the scoreboard.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Thousands of Cambodian survivors of the Khmer Rouge on Sunday marked 39 years since the fall of the brutal regime that killed an estimated 1.7 million people.  Up to 40,000 people attended an event in the capital Phnom Penh, organized by the ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party (CPP) of Prime Minister Hun Sen, installed by the Vietnamese who invaded Cambodia on January 7, 1979 and put and end to the regime.  \u201cThe January 7 victory saved the lives of people who survived the killings and brought back to the Cambodian people rights lost under the regime of Pol Pot,\u201d Hun Sen said at the ceremony.  Most of the victims of the regime died of torture, starvation, exhaustion or disease in labor camps or were beaten to death during mass executions in the \u201ckilling fields\u201d.  The day is controversial in Cambodia, with Hun Sen\u2019s party celebrating it as a day of liberation while others mourn it as the start of a 10-year occupation by their hated Vietnamese neighbors.  The rise and fall of the genocidal Khmer Rouge was initiated by Vietnam to \u201cdivide and weaken\u201d Cambodia to keep it under Vietnamese control, former opposition leader Sam Rainsy said in a post on his Facebook page.      The day marks Cambodia\u2019s journey toward a brighter future, the United States said.  \u201cWe also celebrate the ingenuity, courage, and perseverance with which the Cambodian people have emerged from this period of darkness, rebuilt their country, and carried forward the process of national reconciliation,\u201d the U.S. embassy said in a statement.  The anniversary comes amid an opposition crackdown by Hun Sen\u2019s government ahead of a July general election.  The United States and the European Union withdrew support for the vote following the dissolution of the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party last year but China, Cambodia\u2019s biggest foreign backer, said on Thursday it believes the election this year will be fair.  Pol Pot\u2019s three top surviving henchmen are serving life sentences on convictions by a joint Cambodian-United Nations tribunal for various crimes, including crimes against humanity.   Those in custody are former Khmer Rouge S-21 prison chief Kaing Guek Eav, \u2018Brother Number Two\u2019 Nuon Chea and former President Khieu Samphan.

Villanova coach Jay Wright captured his 400th win with the program on the Main Line.  Mikal Bridges contributed 18 and Donte DiVincenzo had 14 for the Wildcats (14-1, 2-1 Big East). In Villanova\u2019s previous game, the Wildcats fell at Butler 101-93, allowing the Bulldogs to connect on 15 of 22 from 3-point range. This time, Marquette was 11 of 31 from beyond the arc.

Villanova pushed ahead 53-36 early in the second half following five straight points by Brunson on a 3-pointer and a short jumper.  However, the Golden Eagles began to chip away, anchored by Howard. During one stretch, Howard scored 10 consecutive points, but Marquette still trailed 64-50 with 13:52 remaining.  Bridges converted a three-point play and extended the lead back to 67-50.  Marquette then ripped off nine straight points with Howard\u2019s layup getting the visitors within 67-59.  Brunson then took over with an assist to DiVincenzo for a dunk, a jumper in the lane and a clutch 3-pointer with 6:15 remaining to put the Wildcats back up 78-65.  It was more than enough of a cushion for the Wildcats, who withstood a furious late rally by the Golden Eagles.  Villanova started red hot and remained that way the entire first half, shooting 62 percent (18 of 29).  Paschall entered the game averaging 9.3 points per game, and he scored 11 first-half points on 4-of-5 shooting.

The Bucks hadn\u2019t won in their past six visits to the nation\u2019s capital.  All five Milwaukee starters scored in double figures. Eric Bledsoe finished with 21 points, Khris Middleton had 20, John Henson 11 and Malcolm Brogdon 10. Reserve Tony Snell also scored 10 for the Bucks, who sank 7 of 22 3-point attempts and shot 48.8 percent overall.  Antetokounmpo (12 rebounds) and Henson (11 rebounds) finished with double-doubles.  The Wizards\u2019 starting five all scored in double figures, too, with Bradley Beal\u2019s 20 leading the way. Marcin Gortat had 17 points, and John Wall contributed 16 points and 16 assists. Markieff Morris amassed 14 points and 10 rebounds, and Kelly Oubre Jr. also scored 14.  Washington shot 47.4 percent while going 8 of 21 from distance but saw its four-game winning streak come to an end.  Trailing by 11 late in the second quarter, the Bucks found a burst of energy and closed out on a 14-4 run over the final 2:37, going into halftime tied at 53 after Bledsoe sank two free throws.  Two free throws by Middleton to open the second half gave Milwaukee its first lead of the evening, setting the stage for an entertaining quarter that featured 10 lead changes. Antetokounmpo scored 13 in the third, but the Bucks gave up 10 points on five turnovers allowing the Wizards, who got two 3-pointers from Jodie Meeks over the final two minutes, to take an 85-82 lead into the fourth.  Milwaukee led 92-90 when Matthew Dellavedova drew a flagrant-2 and was ejected. Dellavedova dragged Beal to the ground while Beal tried to drive past the Bucks\u2019 reserve point guard with 7:25 to play.  Beal missed both free throws, and the Wizards came up empty on the ensuing possession.  Antetokounmpo drew his fifth foul with 6:02 to play and went to the bench until the 3:17 mark. He scored four in a 6-0 Milwaukee run that put the Bucks in front for good, and Bledsoe\u2019s 3-pointer with 1:17 left gave Milwaukee a four-point lead.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Patrice Bergeron lit the lamp four times and added an assist for a career-high-tying five-point night, Anton Khudobin made 27 saves and Boston routed Carolina 7-1 for its third straight victory at TD Garden.  Bergeron, who recorded his 700th career point in the contest, tied a franchise record for goals in a game and became the first Bruins player to score four goals in a game since Dave Andreychuk on Oct. 28, 1999 versus Tampa Bay.  Riley Nash, David Pastrnak and Jake DeBrusk also scored one goal apiece for the hosts \u2014 each in the first period \u2014 as the red-hot Bruins (23-10-6) won for the eighth time in nine games (8-0-1).  Jordan Staal scored the lone goal for the Hurricanes, who pulled goalie Cam Ward just 5:43 into the game after he allowed two quick goals on his first two shots faced. Scott Darling relieved Ward and finished with 23 saves on 28 shots.  Carolina (19-14-8) lost for the third time in four tries (1-2-1).  Boston stormed out of the gate with five goals in the first 20 minutes, with the goals coming from Bergeron (at 3:14 and 14:34 of the first period), Nash (5:43), Pastrnak (9:04) and DeBrusk (10:22).  Staal briefly gave the Hurricanes hope with his tally at 7:09 of the opening period to pull Carolina within 2-1, but Pastrnak answered less than two minutes later to restore the two-goal advantage.  Bergeron netted both of the Bruins\u2019 goals in the second period, at 5:36 and 10:45 of the second respectively, to give him 16 goals on the season.  Nash\u2019s goal was his fifth, Pastrnak\u2019s was his 16th and DeBrusk\u2019s was his ninth.  Boston opens a two-game road trip Sunday at Pittsburgh.

LeBron James finished with 33 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists. He also had six steals. Kevin Love had a big game with 27 points.  Cleveland (26-13) won for just the second time in six games and is in third place in the Eastern Conference behind Boston and Toronto.  Meanwhile, the Magic (12-28) have struggled all season and dropped 13 of their past 14 games. Orlando ranks 27th in the NBA, allowing 110.2 points per game and are 28th with a minus-5.7 point differential.  Aaron Gordon led the Magic with 30 points. Elfrid Payton scored 20 and Evan Fournier added 18.  Thomas hit a pair of jumpers and Cleveland took control by scoring the opening eight points of the third quarter to take a 75-64 lead.

A jumper by JR Smith boosted the lead to 20. The Magic would not go quietly, however, and Gordon cut the lead to 109-99 early in the fourth quarter. Orlando chipped away and Payton hit a jumper that cut the Cavaliers\u2019 lead to 128-125 with 40 seconds left. However, Dwyane Wade (16 points) iced the game with a 3-foot shot.

After letting a double-digit lead slip away through the first 6 1/2 minutes of the second half, the No. 6 Mountaineers took control when their best player was forced to the bench, knocking off No. 7 Oklahoma 89-76 on Saturday night at WVU Coliseum in Morgantown, W.Va.  For much of the game, West Virginia\u2019s Jevon Carter, one of the best defenders in college basketball, got the better of the Sooners\u2019 freshman phenom, Trae Young.  However, early in the second half, Young attacked Carter on offense, and by the time 13:30 remained in the game, Oklahoma led by two and Carter was forced to the bench with his fourth foul.  Without Carter, though, the Mountaineers took over.  After Young\u2019s free throws resulting from Carter\u2019s fourth foul put the Sooners up 53-51, West Virginia reeled off an 18-6 run to regain control.  Carter didn\u2019t come back until less than four minutes remained in the game with his team leading by eight.  Young, the nation\u2019s leading scorer, finished with 29 points, but he shot just 8 of 22 from the field, including 3 of 12 from behind the 3-point arc.  Teddy Allen came off the bench to lead West Virginia with 20 points. Lamont West and Carter added 17 apiece, and Sagaba Konate had 16 points, all but two of them in the second half. Konate added 13 rebounds, and Carter had 10 assists.  The win was the 14th consecutive for the Mountaineers (14-1, 3-0 Big 12).

West Virginia outscored Oklahoma off turnovers 21-9.  As important, the Mountaineers pestered Young, regularly bracketing him in the backcourt making it difficult for him to bring the ball up the floor and take advantage of the vision he has become known for.  Young, who came into the game leading the nation in assists, was held to just five, tying a season low. He wound up with eight turnovers.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. astronaut John Young, who walked on the moon in 1972 and even smuggled a corned beef sandwich into orbit during a career that made him the only person to fly with three NASA space programs, has died at age 87, officials said on Saturday.      Young, who went to space six times, died on Friday night at his home in Houston following complications from pneumonia, National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman Allard Beutel said in an email.   The former U.S. Navy test pilot was the ninth person to set foot on the moon, an experience shared by three others after Young. He eventually became one of the most accomplished astronauts in the history of the U.S. space program.  He flew into space twice during NASA\u2019s Gemini program in the mid-1960s, twice on the Apollo lunar missions and twice on space shuttles in the 1980s. He was the only person to fly on all three types of programs.  \u201cAstronaut John Young\u2019s storied career spanned three generations of spaceflight. We will stand on his shoulders as we look toward the next human frontier,\u201d NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot said in a statement.  Young, described in a NASA tweet as \u201cour most experienced astronaut,\u201d retired in 2004 after 42 years with the U.S. space agency.  The Apollo 16 mission in April 1972, his fourth space flight, took Young to the lunar surface.  As mission commander, he and crewmate Charles Duke explored the moon\u2019s Descartes Highlands region, gathering 200 pounds (90 kg) of rock and soil samples and driving more than 16 miles (26 km) in the lunar rover to sites such as Spook Crater.  Recalling his lunar exploits, Young told the Houston Chronicle in 2004: \u201cOne-sixth gravity on the surface of the moon is just delightful. It\u2019s not like being in zero gravity, you know. You can drop a pencil in zero gravity and look for it for three days. In one-sixth gravity, you just look down and there it is.\u201d  Young\u2019s first time in space came in 1965 with the Gemini 3 mission that took him and astronaut Gus Grissom into Earth orbit in the first two-person U.S. space jaunt.  It was on this mission that Young pulled his sandwich stunt, which did not make NASA brass happy but certainly pleased Grissom, the recipient of the snack.  Astronaut Wally Schirra, who was not flying on the mission, bought the corned beef sandwich on rye bread from a delicatessen in Cocoa Beach, Florida, and asked Young to give it to Grissom in space. During the flight, as they discussed the food provided for the mission, Young handed Grissom the sandwich.  NASA later rebuked Young for the antics, which generated criticism from lawmakers and the media, but his career did not suffer.  His May 1969 Apollo 10 mission served as a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for the historic Apollo 11 mission two months later in which Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon. Young and his crew undertook each aspect of that subsequent mission except for an actual moon landing.  Young\u2019s fifth space mission was as commander of the inaugural flight of NASA\u2019s first space shuttle, Columbia, in 1981. He became the first person to fly six space missions in 1983, when he commanded Columbia on the first Spacelab trek, with the crew performing more than 70 scientific experiments.  He never went to space again. Young had been due to command a 1986 flight that was canceled after the explosion of the shuttle Challenger earlier that year.   \u201cJohn was more than a good friend,\u201d former President George H.W. Bush said in a statement. \u201cHe was a fearless patriot whose courage and commitment to duty helped our nation push back the horizon of discovery at a critical time.\u201d  Young was born on Sept. 24, 1930, in San Francisco and grew up in Orlando, Florida. After receiving a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1952, he entered the Navy and graduated from its test pilot school. NASA picked him in 1962 for its astronaut program.  Reporting and writing by Will Dunham; Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Bill Trott and Lisa Von Ahn"

          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday called on central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda to keep up efforts to reflate the economy, but added he was undecided on whether to reappoint Kuroda for another five-year term.  Kuroda was handpicked by Abe to take the helm of the central bank in 2013 to deploy a massive stimulus program - part of the premier\u2019s \u201cAbenomics\u201d reflationary policies - that helped boost growth but failed to drive up inflation to the bank\u2019s target of 2 percent.  Abe also said the government would continue to work with the central bank to boost growth, so that he could declare an official end to deflation at the earliest date possible.  \u201cGovernor Kuroda has met my expectations with job availability at a 43-year high,\u201d Abe said on public broadcaster NHK.  \u201cI want him to keep up his efforts. But I haven\u2019t made up my mind,\u201d on who should succeed Kuroda when his term ends in April, he added.  Many analysts see a good chance that Kuroda will be reappointed when the government selects successors to him and his two deputies in coming months, decisions that need parliament\u2019s approval.   Abe said Japan\u2019s economy was showing signs of emerging from deflation, with a tightening job market pushing up wages.  \u201cWe\u2019ll deploy all available policies so that we can declare an end to deflation at the earliest date possible,\u201d Abe said.  \u201cIt might not necessarily be this year, but the government and the BOJ must fulfill their responsibilities,\u201d he added, so as to ensure conditions to bring about an end to deflation.  The government looks at several factors, such as inflation data and the output gap, in determining whether the economy is sustainably out of deflation.  Some policymakers are keen to declare an end to deflation, which would help Abe argue his policies succeeded in reflating the economy. But doing so could also give the BOJ justification to withdraw crisis-mode stimulus, some analysts say.

          "body": "South Carolina was short-handed, but center Chris Silva and guard Wesley Myers came up big in the Gamecocks\u2019 71-60 win over the Commodores at the Colonial Life Center in Columbia, S.C. on Saturday night.  Silva scored a career-high 27 points, and Myers added 17, as the Gamecocks improved to 10-5 and got their first Southeastern Conference win in three tries.  Carolina trailed by two at half, but seized the lead on Silva\u2019s dunk at the 17:48 mark of the period and never trailed again.  Myers helped build that lead. He assisted a layup at 17:01 by guard Evan Hinson to put USC up three. Then, after Vandy guard Matthew Fisher-Davis answered with a layup, Myers scored five points during a Carolina 7-0 run to extend the lead to eight.  The Commodores (6-9, 1-2 SEC) were done in by foul trouble. The Gamecocks committed just 17 fouls to Vandy\u2019s 31.  Reserve center Djery Baptiste and starting guards Riley LaChance and Saben Lee fouled out, while Vandy\u2019s other three starters \u2014 forwards Jeff Roberson and Clevon Brown, and guard Max Evans \u2014 each had four.  Roberson, Vandy\u2019s leading scorer (14.9), was held to nine points. He picked up his fourth on a foul away from the ball at 12:42.  Carolina smelled blood, and either went to Silva in the paint, or drove it to the rack, time and time again.  But Vandy hung tough thanks to Carolina hitting just 25-of-39 (64.1 percent) from the line. The \u2018Dores were within six on a Fisher-Davis 3 with 58 seconds left, but Carolina hit 10 foul shots from there, including 4-of-4 from Myers.  Lee led Vandy with 17, but a lack of 3-point success (8-of-29, 27.6 percent) killed the Commodores.  VU led 28-26 at half, with Baptiste leading the team in scoring off the bench. The Commodores started their smaller lineup, with Brown and Evans each earning their third starts.  Vandy coach Bryce Drew drew a first-half technical foul for arguing a call.  The Gamecocks were playing without starting point guard Hassani Gravett, the team\u2019s assist leader. The junior has missed three straight games with a sprained ankle.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "title": "Japan's Abe urges central bank's Kuroda to keep up efforts on economy",
          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday called on central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda to keep up efforts to reflate the economy, but added he was undecided on whether to reappoint Kuroda for another five-year term.  Kuroda was handpicked by Abe to take the helm of the central bank in 2013 to deploy a massive stimulus program - part of the premier\u2019s \u201cAbenomics\u201d reflationary policies - that helped boost growth but failed to drive up inflation to the bank\u2019s target of 2 percent.  Abe also said the government would continue to work with the central bank to boost growth, so that he could declare an official end to deflation at the earliest date possible.  \u201cGovernor Kuroda has met my expectations with job availability at a 43-year high,\u201d Abe said on public broadcaster NHK.  \u201cI want him to keep up his efforts. But I haven\u2019t made up my mind,\u201d on who should succeed Kuroda when his term ends in April, he added.  Many analysts see a good chance that Kuroda will be reappointed when the government selects successors to him and his two deputies in coming months, decisions that need parliament\u2019s approval.   Abe said Japan\u2019s economy was showing signs of emerging from deflation, with a tightening job market pushing up wages.  \u201cWe\u2019ll deploy all available policies so that we can declare an end to deflation at the earliest date possible,\u201d Abe said.  \u201cIt might not necessarily be this year, but the government and the BOJ must fulfill their responsibilities,\u201d he added, so as to ensure conditions to bring about an end to deflation.  The government looks at several factors, such as inflation data and the output gap, in determining whether the economy is sustainably out of deflation.  Some policymakers are keen to declare an end to deflation, which would help Abe argue his policies succeeded in reflating the economy. But doing so could also give the BOJ justification to withdraw crisis-mode stimulus, some analysts say.  Japan\u2019s economy expanded for the seventh straight quarter in July-September, boosted by robust exports and capital expenditure.  Core consumer inflation rose 0.9 percent in November from a year earlier, marking the 11th straight month of gains but still distant from the BOJ\u2019s target of 2 percent.

          "body": "Jose Alvarado scored 23 points and jump-started a second-half surge as Georgia Tech pulled away from Yale for a 74-60 win Saturday at McCamish Pavilion in Atlanta.  Josh Okogie scored 20 points, and Abdoulaye Gueye finished with 14 points and nine rebounds for the Yellow Jackets (8-7).  Miye Oni had 14 points to lead the Bulldogs, who have lost four of five. Paul Atkinson finished with 10 points, and Blake Reynolds and Eric Monroe each added nine points for Yale (7-9).  Georgia Tech was coming off a big win over No. 15 Miami but found itself in an early battle with the pesky Bulldogs from the Ivy League.  The Yellow Jackets broke open a close game early in the second half. Alvarado knocked down a pair of 3-pointers to ignite a 17-6 Georgia Tech run.  Okogie, coming off a career-high 30-point performance against Miami, had another big game against Yale. The sophomore guard capped the run with a layup that gave the Yellow Jackets a 57-42 lead with 13 minutes left in the second half.  Georgia Tech maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the way. Tadric Jackson hit a 3-pointer that gave the Yellow Jackets 74-52 lead with three minutes left.  In a tight, back-and-forth first half, the Bulldogs took a 30-27 lead on a three-point play by Atkinson with three minutes to go before intermission. Georgia Tech\u2019s Ben Lammers had two buckets in the final minutes, and the Yellow Jackets took a 37-33 lead into halftime.  Lammers finished with 10 points and eight rebounds.  Georgia Tech outrebounded Yale 34-23 and outscored the Bulldogs 21-9 at the foul line. The Yellow Jackets made 48.9 percent of their field-goal attempts, while Yale hit 42.9 percent from the floor.  Both teams return to conference play next week. The Yellow Jackets host Notre Dame on Wednesday and then travel to Pittsburgh on Jan. 13 before opening a stretch of four straight games against ranked opponents starting with No. 8 Virginia on Jan. 18.

          "body": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Quarterback Marcus Mariota engineered a second-half comeback Saturday, bringing the Tennessee Titans back from an 18-point halftime deficit to edge the Kansas City Chiefs, 22-21, in an AFC wild-card game at Arrowhead Stadium.  Mariota fired a 22-yard touchdown pass to Eric Decker with 6:06 remaining for the last of 19 consecutive points the Titans scored in the second half.  The Chiefs, who earned an opportunity to host a postseason game by repeating as AFC West champions, lost their sixth straight home playoff game, a streak that dates to 1994 when Joe Montana quarterbacked Kansas City.  The Titans converted three third downs on their game-winning drive, including a 17-yard keeper by Mariota on a play which also included a holding penalty against the Chiefs.  Mariota finished 19 of 31 for 205 yards passing and two touchdowns. Derrick Henry added 156 yards rushing on 23 carries, including a 35-yard touchdown burst with 14:08 remaining.  \u201cExecuting better. That\u2019s what I think it comes down to, guys just making plays. It helps if you can run the football. I thought Derrick had a great game for us and things just clicked,\u2019\u2019 Mariota said of the Titans\u2019 rally  Said Henry, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming for this team to get to the playoffs and get a win. We came into a hostile environment against a great team and a good defense. We stuck together. We got down early, came in at halftime and we just believed in each other.\u2019\u2019  Tennessee, which advanced to the playoffs with a 9-7 record, failed on a pair of two-point conversions after the fourth-quarter touchdowns. On the second, Mariota appeared to lose a fumble, which the Chiefs returned for a two-point conversion only to have the play ruled dead.  For Tennessee coach Mike Mularkey, whose job was rumored to be on the line should the Titans lose, it was a relief.  \u201cI don\u2019t think (the discussion) is fair to my family. If it has an effect on my family, it has an effect on me. So yeah, it had a big effect on me. I didn\u2019t have any support to say I was (secure). I just assumed the worst,\u2019\u2019 Mularkey said.  But his team made sure that talk would quiet down.  \u201cIt\u2019s this team. They have each other\u2019s backs and they always have.\u2019\u2019  The Chiefs struck for touchdowns on two first-quarter possessions. Kareem Hunt scored on a 1-yard plunge to cap an 81-yard march. Tight end Travis Kelce added a 13-yard reception from Alex Smith to complete a 76-yard march.  Those drives helped boost Smith\u2019s passing total to 154 yards for the quarter as he completed 8 of 11 attempts, including back-to-back throws of 45 and 27 yards to Tyreek Hill and Kelce on the first TD march.  Kansas City executed its two-minute drill to perfection to end the half, starting from its 21 with 1:48 left before Smith connected with Demarcus Robinson for a 14-yard touchdown with three seconds remaining. Robinson had four catches on the drive as Smith passed for 231 first-half yards, going 19-of-23.  The Titans\u2019 only first-half score came on a 49-yard field goal by Ryan Succop with two minutes left. A vicious sack of Mariota by Chiefs linebacker Derrick Johnson caused the drive to stall. Although Mariota fumbled on the play, he was ruled down by forward contact and a review the Chiefs wanted was not allowed.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can call a guy down or blow the whistle when he hadn\u2019t hit the ground yet, especially on a sack,\u2019\u2019 Johnson said.  Smith added just 33 yards passing in the second half. The Chiefs\u2019 best opportunity for a second-half score was a 48-yard field goal attempt by Harrison Butker that missed off the left upright with 2:25 left in the third quarter.  The Chiefs\u2019 QB was still trying to process blowing a 21-3 lead afterward.  \u201cWe had a chance and now it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s over. ... It\u2019s definitely a shock. Definitely didn\u2019t feel like we played like we were capable. Certainly disappointing.\u2019\u2019  \u2014Field Level Media"

Coming off a double-overtime loss to Stanford on Thursday, UCLA (12-4, 3-1) wasted no time dispatching Cal (7-9, 1-2), which was similarly run off the court in the first half of its home drubbing at the hands of USC two days earlier.  After Cal\u2019s Marcus Lee dropped in the game\u2019s first basket, Holiday got UCLA rolling with a 3-pointer that gave the Bruins the lead for good one second into the second minute of the game.  The contest became a run-away shortly thereafter, with Welsh and Wilkes adding 3-pointers and Holiday mixing in a layup and two free throws, giving UCLA a 13-2 lead at the 16:58 mark of the first half.  An Alex Olesinski 3-pointer made it a 20-point game, 35-15, with 8:11 left in the half, and UCLA went on to run up a 54-33 halftime advantage.  The Bruins made eight 3-pointers in the half, with Welsh connecting on three of them to account for a majority of his 15 points in the first 20 minutes.  Down 70-50, Cal closed within 11 with a 12-3 run that featured two 3-pointers each by Justice Sueing and Darius McNeill.  But Olesinski converted a four-point play \u2014 hitting a 3-pointer on which he was fouled \u2014 and UCLA, which blew a 13-point, second-half lead in its loss at Stanford, was never threatened again.  Holiday finished with 21 points and Welsh had 19 for UCLA, which moved atop the conference standings with the win.  The Bruins, who shot 17-for-30 on 3s (56.7 percent), placed six players in double figures, including Wilkes with 16, Prince Ali with 15, Olesinski with 14 and Jaylen Hands with 11.  Sueing totaled 22 points, Lee 19 and Don Coleman 16 for Cal, which had opened conference play last week with a win at Stanford.

Tatum scored half of his 14 points in the fourth quarter to help Boston win its sixth straight and beat the Nets for the eighth consecutive meeting.  The Nets held an 83-82 lead on a finger-roll layup by Spencer Dinwiddie with 91 seconds remaining, but 15 seconds later, Tatum gave Boston the lead for good on a driving dunk.  After Dinwiddie missed a floater with 55.8 seconds left, Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving missed a layup but snatched the rebound from Brooklyn forward DeMarre Carroll and fed Tatum, who hit a corner 3-pointer with 45.7 seconds to play for an 87-83 lead.  A put-back layup by Brooklyn\u2019s Joe Harris with 36.9 seconds left made it 87-85, and the Nets had another chance to tie or win after Irving missed a floater with 21.3 seconds left. Dinwiddie and Harris missed layups before the Nets called their final timeout.  After Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Carroll missed potential tying shots, the game ended when Hollis-Jefferson missed a tip-in just before the buzzer.  Irving led the Celtics with 21 points but shot 8-of-22 as Boston finished at 37.8 percent (37-of-98). Tatum recorded a career-best six blocked shots as Boston had 13 blocks while playing without Al Horford (sore left calf).

The once-fringe Anglophone movement in majority Francophone Cameroon has gathered pace in the last few months following a military crackdown on protests. It represents the gravest challenge yet to the 35-year rule of President Paul Biya who will seek re-election this year.

          "body": "RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian authorities have detained 11 princes after they gathered at a royal palace in Riyadh in a rare protest against the government suspending payment of their utility bills, the public prosecutor said on Saturday.  Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, has introduced reforms that include reducing energy subsidies, introducing value-added tax and cutting some perks to royal family members to try to cope with a drop in crude prices that has caused a budget deficit estimated at 195 billion riyals ($52 billion) in 2018.  The princes had gathered on Thursday at Qasr al-Hokm palace demanding the cancellation of a recent decree that halted state payment of water and electricity bills for royal family members and seeking compensation for a death sentence implemented in 2016 against one of their cousins, Prince Turki bin Saud al-Kabeer.  \u201cDespite being informed that their demands are not lawful, the 11 princes refused to leave the area, disrupting public peace and order. Members of a security services stepped in to restore order and the princes were arrested,\u201d the public prosecutor\u2019s statement said, without identifying the princes.  \u201cFollowing their arrest, they have been charged on a number of counts in relation to these offences. They are detained at Al-Hayer prison south of the capital pending their trial.\u201d  News website Sabq earlier identified the leader of the group of princes by the initials S.A.S. The Saud al-Kabeer branch of the House of Saud descend from a cousin of late King Abdulaziz, who founded the modern kingdom.  The meteoric rise of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the king\u2019s favored son, and his ambitious, sometimes aggressive, policies have caused rare tensions within the royal family, which for decades favored rule by consensus.  Dozens of prices, high officials and senior businessmen were rounded up in November in a crackdown on graft that has boosted Prince Mohammed\u2019s power.  They have been held at the five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh while government officials negotiate financial settlements, asking them to hand over assets and cash in return for their freedom.  The round-up followed a meticulously planned palace coup in June through which Prince Mohammed ousted his elder cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as heir to the throne.

Americans spent $80.5 billion on lottery games last year, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.  Powerball tickets are sold in 44 states, and Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Mega Millions tickets are offered in the same locations, excluding Puerto Rico.  The largest Powerball jackpot was a $1.6-billion payout split among winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016, the association said. The largest Mega Millions jackpot of $656 million was won in 2012.  The totals have ballooned as no one has hit either jackpot since October. On Wednesday, there was no winner of the Powerball jackpot, worth an estimated $460 million. A day earlier, no one had matched all six numbers in a Mega Millions drawing, lottery officials said.   The estimated totals are before tax.  The odds of a single ticket hitting all six numbers in the Powerball are 292 million to 1, the Multi-State Lottery Association says. The odds of picking the right six numbers for the Mega Millions jackpot are 303 million to 1, the game said.  \u201cWhen the jackpots reach these levels, everyone starts to daydream about what they would do if they won,\u201d Gordon Medenica, Mega Millions lead director, said in a statement.

          "body": "(Reuters) - World number one Dustin Johnson put the hammer down and surged to a two-shot lead after the third round at the Sentry Tournament of Champions in Hawaii on Saturday.  Boosted by an eagle at the par-four 12th, where he flicked a 70-yard shot into the hole, Johnson matched the day\u2019s best score with a seven-under-par 66.  Johnson, who drove the ball prodigious distances, posted a 16-under 203 total, while joint halfway leader Brian Harman remained in the hunt with a steady 69 to stand alone at 14-under on another breezy day at the Kapalua Plantation course on Maui.  Spaniard Jon Rahm played the final five holes in five under to match Johnson\u2019s 66 and trail by four shots.  \u201cI drove it really well, obviously that\u2019s a big bonus around here, and I hit a lot of good iron shots and I feel like I\u2019m rolling it well (on the greens),\u201d Johnson told Golf Channel.  His eagle did not hurt his score either.  \u201cI landed my shot perfect and it got on the green and tracked to the hole,\u201d he said of the shot, which he landed some 30 yards short of the cup and watched as he ball rolled down  the steep slope and into the hole.  Johnson had been in similar imperious form early last season before he had to withdraw from the Masters following a fall down some stairs.  A bruised back kept him out of action for four weeks and by time he regained his form the majors had passed, and attention had turned to the likes of Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth.  Johnson, however, is showcasing similarly good form in Hawaii and is determined not to repeat the experience of last October when he surrendered a six-shot lead in the final round at the HSBC Champions in Shanghai.  \u201cThat was just kind of a fluke day,\u201d he said.  \u201cI was playing a new set of irons and I wasn\u2019t that comfortable with them. I\u2019m a lot more comfortable with them now. I feel like I can control the ball very well.  \u201cI\u2019ve got a good game plan around here. I\u2019m not going to play any different tomorrow.\u201d  Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Greg Stutchbury"

          "body": "CAIRO (Reuters) - The head of the Coptic Church, Pope Tawadros II, led midnight mass in the cathedral of Egypt\u2019s new administrative capital on Saturday, a service attended by President Abdel Fattah al Sisi.  The mass, on the eve of Coptic Christmas which is celebrated on Jan. 7, was the first to be held in the newly-built cathedral and took place amid tight security. Sisi was cheered by worshippers as he entered the building.  The new Egyptian capital, announced in March 2015, is intended partly to reduce crowding in Cairo.  Some 45 km (28 miles) east of Cairo, the city, which has not yet been given a name, will be home to government ministries, housing and an airport.  The celebrations were held days after attacks on a Coptic church and another Christian-owned shop that left more than 10 people dead.  Egypt\u2019s large Christian minority has increasingly been targeted in recent years by Islamist militants including Islamic State, which is waging an insurgency in the north of the remote Sinai Peninsula.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - One of New Zealand\u2019s senior political figures, former deputy prime minister James Patrick Anderton, has died in a Christchurch hospital, aged 79.  The idealistic former president of New Zealand\u2019s progressive Labour Party became disillusioned with the organization\u2019s direction in 1989 so he broke away to create the NewLabour Party and, later, the Alliance Party to pursue full employment and the retention of public assets.  As Alliance Party leader, he served as deputy prime minister in a coalition government with Labour under prime minister Helen Clark from 1999 to 2002.  Born on 21 January 1938, Anderton died just two weeks before his 80th birthday.  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Sunday that Anderton had been a towering figure in the Labour movement for decades. He built a powerful campaigning organization, selected candidates who became ministers and prime minister and was an innovative fundraiser, she said in an emailed announcement.  \u201cHe will be remembered as someone who stood up for his principles and for the people he represented.\u00a0His integrity during difficult times marked him out as a true leader.\u201d  \u201cWe mourn his loss, and extend our heartfelt sympathies to Jim\u2019s wife Carole, his family and friends.\u201d  Anderton devoted much of his life to public service and used his retirement to campaign for the restoration of Canterbury Cathedral, severely damaged in an earthquake.

Indiana\u2019s Justin Smith finished with 20 points on 7-of-10 shooting.  Davis averages 9.6 points and 4.3 rebounds per game but is out indefinitely after reportedly rupturing his Achilles tendon in practice. Hartman went through pregame warm-ups but did not participate due to a sore right shoulder.  Indiana (9-7, 2-2 Big Ten) led 32-31 at halftime, but trailed by as many as eight points in the second half. Smith hit a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 2:33 remaining to give the Hoosiers a 71-70 lead, their first in nearly seven minutes.  Minnesota (13-4, 2-2) was without senior center Reggie Lynch, who was suspended indefinitely Friday after the university found him responsible for sexual misconduct. Lynch averages 10.1 points, eight rebounds and 4.1 blocks per game, and he was named the 2016 Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year. He is appealing the suspension.  Nate Mason led the Golden Gophers with 22 points and nine assists but went cold late, missing his final four shot attempts.  Minnesota scored just one point \u2014 a free-throw by Dupree McBrayer \u2014 in the final 2:47 of play. McBrayer finished with 18 points, shooting 7 of 13 from the field.

Iowa State answered when Lindell Wigginton was fouled converting a layup and he made the ensuing free throw to give his team a 49-48 lead with 10:58 left in the game.

Five players scored in double-figures for the Huskies (12-4, 2-1 Pac-12) , who shot 52.7 percent despite making only 2 of 12 3-point attempts. They made up for their inability to shoot from long range by dominating the Cougars inside, where Washington outscored State 50-24 despite being outrebounded 40-25.  Robert Franks\u2019 22 points led the Cougars (8-7, 0-3), who shot 40 percent and were 7-of-27 from beyond the arc but turned the ball over 23 times.  Washington State committed 14 turnovers and only shot 39 percent, including 4-of-14 from distance, in the first half, but an 8-0 run late in the half gave them a seven-point lead before the Huskies scored four straight to head into the locker room down 30-27.  The Cougars looked like they were going to take control in the second half, leading by as many as seven early, and withstood a 9-0 Washington run that cut the Huskies\u2019 deficit to 45-44 with 12:58 to play.

Franks fed Jeff Pollard for a 3, putting the Huskies back in front, but Crisp\u2019s layup with 1:46 left made it a 66-65 game.

Klay Thompson and David West added 10 points for the Warriors, while Draymond Green came close to a triple-double with nine points, 12 rebounds and seven assists.  Guard Lou Williams came in off the bench and tossed in 23 points to lead the Clippers (17-21). DeAndre Jordan collected 15 points and 11 rebounds for a double-double, while reserve guard Tyrone Wallace hit for 13 points.

Curry wasted little time putting his stamp on the game, scoring 17 points in the first 8:31.

Tyus Battle \u2014 one of the Orange\u2019s Big Three \u2014 hit a 3-pointer with 49 seconds remaining to tie the score at 49. Battle had the ball in his hands in the closing seconds, but he was stripped by Notre Dame\u2019s T.J. Gibbs and Rex Pflueger grabbed the rebound after Gibbs\u2019 miss and banked in a layup with 2 seconds left to give the Irish the come-from-behind victory.  In winning at the Carrier Dome for the first time since 2007, Notre Dame (13-3, 3-0 in the ACC) played without its two best players, seniors Bonzie Colson (fractured left foot) and point guard Matt Farrell (sprained ankle). Colson, the ACC\u2019s Preseason Player of the Year, was averaging 21.4 points and 10.4 rebounds per game, while Farrell was averaging 15.9 points and 5.1 assists prior to Wednesday\u2019s game when he was injured.  Battle, who scored a game-high 21 points, Frank Howard (10) and Oshae Brissett (10) combined for 41 of Syracuse\u2019s 49 points. Brissett also grabbed 11 rebounds for the Orange (12-4, 1-2). Battle, Howard and Brissett entered the game averaging a combined 50.4 points per game.  Gibbs led the Irish with 18 points, Pflueger added 12 and Martinas Geben grabbed 14 rebounds as Notre Dame outrebounded Syracuse 42-27.  With Pflueger and D.J. Harvey sinking 3-pointers, the Irish opened the second half on an 8-0 run that whittled Syracuse\u2019s lead to 28-27. Battle responded by scoring seven of the Orange\u2019s next 10 points, as Syracuse held a 38-34 advantage with about eight minutes remaining.  Pflueger\u2019s 3-pointer from the wing with 6:47 remaining cut the Orange\u2019s lead to 38-37, and the teams traded baskets for the next two minutes as Syracuse stayed ahead, 44-43. Notre Dame moved ahead on a pair of Gibbs\u2019 free throws and Geben\u2019s inside bucket, but Battle\u2019s 3-pointer erased the Irish\u2019s 49-46 lead.  At the outset, Notre Dame struggled to score against Syracuse\u2019s vaunted 2-3 zone defense without Colson and Farrell. The Irish missed their first 10 shots, made just one field goal in the first 10 minutes of the game and trailed 10-3 midway through the first half.  Gibbs\u2019 3-pointer and rebound basket pulled Notre Dame within 10-8, but the Orange outscored the Irish 18-11 for the remainder of the half to lead 28-19 at the break. Battle (9 points), Howard (8) and Brissett (7) combined for 24 of Syracuse\u2019s first-half points, while Gibbs kept the Irish close with 14 first-half points. Gibbs shot 5-for-10 in the first half while his teammates combined to shoot 1-for-19.  At halftime, Syracuse retired the No. 22 jersey of Dennis DuVal, who scored 1,504 points for the Orange from 1971-74 and later became the City of Syracuse Police Chief. DuVal is the 11th Syracuse player to have his jersey retired.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Steffon Mitchell scored 17 points, Jordan Chatman had 12 points and Ky Bowman added 11 and 10 rebounds as Boston College (11-5, 2-2 ACC) snapped a two-game skid following back-to-back losses to ranked opponents.  Demon Deacons leading scorer Bryant Crawford paced the team\u2019s attack with 24 points. Chaundee Brown added 20 points, but only six came after halftime.  Wake Forest played without second-leading scorer Keyshawn Woods (14.8 points per game), who was sidelined with a knee injury he sustained three minutes in against Syracuse.  Wake Forest (8-7, 1-2) had won four straight meetings against Boston College and has now dropped three of its last four games overall after beating Syracuse at home on Wednesday.  Boston College\u2019s two conference victories through four ACC games this season matched its total from last season.  The Eagles scored the first five points of the second half to go up 40-35 and never trailed in the period, leading by as many as 12 points.  Two free throws from Brandon Childress had the BC lead down to 46-45 with 12:26 remaining, but the Eagles gradually pulled away with a 16-6 run and took their first double-digit lead on a pair of Robinson free throws with 5:04 to go.  Wake Forest kept pressing and had the lead down to five in the final minute, but Boston College made its free throws to ice the contest.  The teams were tied after a tight first half in which neither side led by more than eight points.  Boston College travels to face No. 12 North Carolina on Tuesday.

The Stars have won six of their past eight games and were playing their last game before returning to the ice next Saturday for the finale of a six-game homestand.  Edmonton (18-21-3, 39 points) outshot the Stars 38-33 but couldn\u2019t solve the Dallas defense and smoking hot goalkeeper Ben Bishop, who started his 10th straight game and has allowed two goals or fewer in five of his past eight, with two shutouts.  The Oilers have lost five of their past six outings (one in overtime) and have been outscored 16-3 in their past four games.  Dallas (24-16-3, 51 points) jumped to the lead with 9:39 to play in the first period when Alexander Radulov and Tyler Seguin worked a 2-on-1 breakaway after a clearing pass from John Klingberg. Seguin carried the puck into the offensive zone and feathered a nifty assist to Radulov, who found a small hole between the left arm and body of Edmonton goaltender Cam Talbot to dribble the puck into the goal.  Radulov also had a hand in Stars\u2019 second goal just two and a half minutes later, feeding a pass across the slot to Jamie Benn, who went above Talbot\u2019s left shoulder to find the net.  The Stars\u2019 top line produced again with 3:28 remaining in the initial period, with Seguin waiting at the far post for Radulov\u2019s assist and making short work of the chance to push the Dallas lead to 3-0. Klingberg did the dirty work behind the Edmonton net to get the puck to Radulov.  Mattias Janmark added to the Stars\u2019 advantage with an unassisted goal four and a half minutes in the second period.  Leon Draisaitl\u2019s power-play goal off a deflected shot by Ryan Nugent-Hopkins 2:04 into the final period brought the Oilers to within 4-1. But Dallas responded eight minutes later as Klingberg rebuilt the four-goal advantage with a goal off assists from Seguin and Janmark to all but cement the game.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Angel Delgado added 28 points and 15 rebounds, including a key offensive board in the final seconds. Delgado secured his sixth offensive rebound of the game with 13 seconds remaining and immediately kicked the ball to Myles Powell on the perimeter. Powell sank two free throws to make it 86-82, and finished with nine points despite shooting 1-of-4 from the field.

          "body": "BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A shroud of bone-chilling arctic air covered the U.S. East Coast and Midwest on Saturday, creating dangerous conditions as tens of millions of people struggled to clean up from a blizzard that dumped deep, drifting snow in many areas earlier this week.   Wind chill and freeze warnings stretched from New England to Ohio and Pennsylvania, while the National Weather Service warned of freezing rain in Missouri and areas to the northeast.   In some of those places, exposed skin could freeze within 30 minutes, said meteorologist Dan Petersen of the National Weather Service\u2019s Maryland-based Weather Prediction Center.  At the Whoopie Pie Cafe in Bangor, Maine, business was slow because of the cold, cashier and waiter Liz Gallagher, 58, said by phone. \u201cNobody goes out when it\u2019s really cold, at least I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said the life-long Bangor resident.  The cold snap complicated efforts by crews to clear snow and ice from roadways after the blizzard, which clobbered the Northeast after sprinkling snow in areas as far south as Savannah, Georgia and Tallahassee, Florida.  In New England and the Middle Atlantic states, the storm forced hundreds of schools to close and commuter rail services to suspend or reduce service.     Cold and snowy weather was blamed for at least 18 deaths in the past few days, including four in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas.       \u201cThe magnitude of the cold and the area of coverage of the cold is really what\u2019s impressive to me,\u201d said meteorologist Ed Vallee, owner of Vallee Weather Consulting.  Killington, the famous Vermont ski resort, closed on Saturday even though snow conditions were excellent, saying wind chill on the slopes was at least minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 46 degrees Celsius).  \u201cIt\u2019s just too cold to put folks out there,\u201d the resort said on its website.  In neighboring New Hampshire, the ambient air temperature on Mount Washington plunged to -36 F (minus 38C), two degrees short of a record low for Jan. 6. But sustained winds of 99 miles per hour (159 km/h) and gusts of up to 112 mph (180 km/h) atop the 6,200-foot (1,990-metre) peak made it feel more like minus 92 F (minus 69 Celsius), the NWS said.  The brutal cold in parts of the East Coast and Midwest shows no sign of abating this weekend, but a thaw should begin on Monday, said meteorologist Bob Oravec of the Weather Prediction Center. Before then, conditions will probably worsen.  Overnight, more than 30 cities from New England to the mid-Atlantic states could experience record cold, Petersen said. New York and Boston are among the big cities where records could fall.  Among the coldest places in the country on Saturday afternoon were the small Minnesota towns of Cotton and Embarrass, where the mercury plummeted to minus 39F (minus 39C), the NWS said.  \u201cThe air hurt my face,\u201d Charlie Jessen, 25, an employee at the Superamerica gas station in Cotton, 36 miles (58 km) northwest of Duluth, said by phone.  Even so, temperatures for those hamlets in the northeastern corner of Minnesota fell short of a record low for the area, where sub-zero readings are not unusual in January.   In the more populous Northeast, New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport set an all-time low for Jan. 6 at 8 F (minus 13C), Oravec said.  The airport had closed from Thursday to Friday morning when snow created white-out conditions. Some passengers endured more delays on Saturday after the wing of a China Southern plane clipped the tail of a Kuwait Airlines jet on the tarmac.   The East Coast\u2019s first snowstorm of 2018 was energized by a rapid drop in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d The phenomenon gave rise to gusts of more than 70 mph (113 km/h) and produced snowfall totals of 22 inches (56 cm) in parts of Maine and 17 inches (43 cm) in parts of Massachusetts, the NWS said.

          "title": "Williams paints benign picture of Fed rate hikes, strong U.S. economy",
          "body": "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should raise interest rates three times this year given the already strong economy will get a boost from tax cuts, and can tighten more or less aggressively if needed, a key U.S. rate-setter said on Saturday.  In an interview, San Francisco Fed President John Williams painted a benign picture of the world\u2019s largest economy operating at or near its full capacity over the next few years.  While his colleagues at the U.S. central bank see unemployment dipping only slightly from 4.1 percent currently, Williams predicted it would fall to 3.7 percent this year without any risk of a worrisome jump in inflation.  The comments from Williams, a veteran policymaker at a time of an unprecedented leadership overhaul at the Fed, suggest the central bank remains confident in its approach after a year of gradual tightening even in the face of the $1.5-trillion tax-cut bill passed last month.    \u201cWe\u2019re in a pretty good situation: the economy is doing great, everyone expects us to raise rates gradually ... and if the data change we can respond to that,\u201d said Williams, who has a vote on policy this year under a rotation.  \u201cI\u2019m not worried about inflation suddenly taking off,\u201d he told Reuters over lunch during an American Economic Association conference in Philadelphia. \u201cSomething like three rate hikes makes sense to me\u201d this year, he added.  The U.S. central bank hiked rates three times in 2017 in response to robust growth and falling unemployment, despite sagging inflation which has fallen short of a 2 percent goal for more than five years.   Median forecasts from Fed officials see three more hikes in 2018 as the tax stimulus, including cuts for corporations and individuals, seeps into the economy.  The Trump administration argues the tax cuts will boost both business and consumer spending. But the individual income tax cuts are skewed toward higher-income households, which economists say have a low propensity to consume more as taxes fall.   Many economists also believe companies will use much of the windfall on stock buybacks and debt reduction rather than capital expenditure.  Williams said the cuts should have a \u201cmodest, positive effect\u201d on economic growth over the next three years due to consumer spending and business investment. He expects gross domestic product growth of 2.5 percent in 2018, in line with overall Fed estimates, as well as a modest boost to the labor force and productivity, which has been surprisingly weak through the recovery from recession.  The U.S. economy will be \u201cin a very positive place two years from now: I think we\u2019ll be at 2 percent inflation and around 4 percent unemployment,\u201d Williams said.

Al-Attiyah, driving a Toyota Hilux, ended the day with a 25- second lead over Dutch team mate Bernhard ten Brinke after the 35km special stage through the sand dunes around Pisco, down the coast from Lima.  While they enjoyed a trouble-free run, nine-times world rally champion Sebastian Loeb had a harder time and was six minutes off the lead after suffering brake issues with his Peugeot.  Loeb said his brakes failed after three kilometers of the stage, with the handbrake also failing.  \u201cWe went slowly, doing our best not to get stuck or bogged down,\u201d said the Frenchman. \u201cThere were dunes with steep descents, so I had to stop accelerating 200 meters before that to avoid any risks.  \u201cIt was quite tricky, driving without brakes is exasperating. It was a difficult start,\u201d he told the dakar.com website.   Peugeot\u2019s reigning champion Stephane Peterhansel of France, who is chasing a 14th Dakar win, was in 11th place and two minutes 15 seconds off the pace.  Portuguese soccer manager Andre Villas Boas, entering his first Dakar, was in 46th place and 11 minutes behind al-Attiyah\u2019s time.  In the motorcycles, KTM\u2019s Dubai-based Sunderland ended the stage with a 32-second advantage over Yamaha\u2019s French rider Adrien van Beveren.  The motorcycles will start after the cars in Sunday\u2019s second stage, a 267km loop that starts and ends in Pisco.  \u201cTomorrow, if we open the road, I know it will be very difficult, but I\u2019m just really happy for today,\u201d said al-Attiyah.

          "body": "(Reuters) - The real estate company of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its use of a federal program that grants visas to wealthy foreigners investing in the United States, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.  Kushner Cos was asked by the SEC for information on its use of the visa program, known as EB-5, in May 2017, according to a person the Journal said was familiar with the matter.  The EB-5 visa is a method for eligible immigrants to become lawful permanent residents, or \u201cgreen card\u201d holders, by investing at least $500,000 into a business in the United States that will employ 10 or more American workers. Most holders are wealthy Chinese individuals.  The Journal said the company also received a separate request from New York federal prosecutors in the same month for information on development projects financed in part by the EB-5 program.  Kushner, the White House and New York prosecutors did not reply to requests for comment from Reuters. The SEC could not be reached for comment.  \u201cAs we said months ago, we are cooperating with all government requests for information about our past legal use of the EB-5 program,\u201d a Kushner Cos representative said in a statement to Reuters.  The exact subject of the SEC\u2019s inquiry, or whether it identified particular projects, is not clear, the Journal reported.  The Kushners\u2019 use of EB-5 visas to raise cash to finance developments came to broad attention in May last year, when Kushner\u2019s sister, Nicole Kushner, spoke at a publicly advertised event in Shanghai to attract Chinese investment into a two-tower luxury apartment complex in New Jersey, called One Journal Square, being developed jointly by Kushner Cos and KABR Group. The company later apologized for mentioning Jared Kushner\u2019s name while wooing investors.  The developers were seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of funding for the project, from investors through the EB-5 visa program, according to marketing materials posted by the event\u2019s organizer, immigration agency Qiaowai, Reuters reported at the time.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Switzerland won their third Hopman Cup on Saturday as Roger Federer and Belinda Bencic beat Germany\u2019s Alexander Zverev and Angelique Kerber 4-3(3) 4-2 in the deciding mixed doubles to secure a 2-1 victory in the final at the Perth Arena.  It was Federer\u2019s second Hopman Cup triumph after victory in 2001 alongside then world number one Martina Hingis.  \u201cShe (Hingis) had a great career and to have that in a small country like Switzerland is very rare,\u201d world number two Federer said after his country\u2019s latest triumph.  \u201cIt made me also believe with hard work and dedication you get really far because I didn\u2019t believe that much at that point when I was younger, I thought it was more all talent.\u201d  Federer had earlier roared back from a set down to beat Zverev 6-7(4) 6-0 6-2 and give the Swiss a 1-0 lead.  Unbeaten in three singles matches in the tournament before the final as he prepares to defend his Australian Open title later this month, the 19-time grand slam champion failed to wrap up the first set despite hitting 20 winners.  However, it was only a matter of time before the 36-year-old Federer found his groove as he raced to win the second set 6-0 before sealing victory in the decider with a drop shot.  \u201cI was trying to play as aggressively as possible. I\u2019m maybe better when we\u2019re closer together,\u201d said Federer.  \u201cThe court plays fast, so it helps if you approach (the net) and do it the right way. It was working out well, so I thought I\u2019d keep going until I had to fix it. That never happened, so I was able to cruise all the way through.\u201d  The tie went to a mixed doubles decider after Kerber continued her strong start to the campaign under new coach Wim Fissette by beating Bencic 6-4 6-1 to level the score at 1-1.  World number four Zverev finished with one singles win from four matches in a patchy preparation ahead of the year\u2019s first grand slam at Melbourne Park starting on Jan. 15.

Baylor held the Longhorns to 20 points and 26 percent shooting in the second half.  Forward Jo Lual-Acuil Jr. and guard Manu Lecomte each scored 17 to lead Baylor (11-4, 1-2 Big 12). Bears forward Mark Vital added 10 points and a team-high seven rebounds.  Guard Jase Febres finished with 18 to lead Texas (10-5, 1-2). Forward Mohamed Bamba scored 15 with nine rebounds.  Texas coach Shaka Smart dipped to 0-5 against Baylor.  Baylor led by nine when Jake Lindsey hit a pair of free throws midway through the second half.  Texas fought back with a 9-2 run and cut Baylor\u2019s lead to 57-55 when forward Dylan Osetkowski made a deep 3-pointer from beyond the arc at the top of the key.  But Baylor pulled away at the end, finishing the game on a 6-0 run in the final 2:07.  Febres scored all 18 of his points in the first half, leading the way as Texas surged ahead by as many as seven.  The Longhorns took a 19-13 advantage when Eric Davis Jr. made a pair of free throws with 11:16 left before the break.  But Baylor responded with a 14-6 run, sparked by Lindsey hitting a 3-pointer and making a layup in transition. Lecomte capped the spurt with a jumper for a 27-25 lead with 6:58 left in the first half.

          "title": "Businesses cautious in installing patches to fix chip flaw",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Chances that a fix to a major microchip security flaw may slow down or crash some computer systems are leading some businesses to hold off installing software patches, fearing the cure may be worse than the original problem.  Researchers this week revealed security problems with chips from Intel Corp (INTC.O) and many of its rivals, sending businesses, governments and consumers scrambling to understand the extent of the threat and the cost of fixes.   Rather than rushing to put on patches, a costly and time-intensive endeavor for major systems, some businesses are testing the fix, leaving their machines vulnerable.  \u201cIf you start applying patches across your whole fleet without doing proper testing, you could cause systems to crash, essentially putting all of your employees out of work,\u201d said Ben Johnson, co-founder of cyber-security startup Obsidian.  Banks and other financial institutions spent much of the week studying the vulnerabilities, said Greg Temm, chief information risk officer with the Financial Services Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an industry group that shares data on emerging cyber threats.  The flaws affect virtually all computers and mobile devices, but are not considered \u201ccritical\u201d because there is no evidence that hackers have figured out how to exploit them, said Temm, whose group works with many of the world\u2019s largest banks.  \u201cIt\u2019s like getting a diagnosis of high blood pressure, but not having a cardiac arrest,\u201d Temm said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it seriously, but it\u2019s not something that is killing us.\u201d   Banks are testing the patches to see if they slow operations and, if so, what changes need to be made, Temm said. For instance, computers could be added to networks to make up for the lack of processor speed in individual machines, he added.  Some popular antivirus software programs are incompatible with the software updates, causing desktop and laptop computers to freeze up and show a \u201cblue screen of death,\u201d researcher Johnson said.  Antivirus software makers responded by rolling out fixes to make their products compatible with the updated operating systems, he said. In a blog posting on Friday, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said it would only offer security patches to Windows customers whose antivirus software suppliers had confirmed with Microsoft that the patch would not crash the customer\u2019s machine.  \u201cIf you have not been offered the security update, you may be running incompatible antivirus software, and you should consult the software vendor,\u201d Microsoft advised in the blog post.  Government agencies also are watching. The Ohio Attorney General\u2019s office is monitoring the situation, a spokesman said by email.  \u201cIntel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time,\u201d the world\u2019s No. 1 chipmaker said on Thursday in a release.  It cited Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft as saying that most users had seen no significant impact on performance after installing the patches.  The cloud vendors are among a group of firms that quickly patched their technology to mitigate against the threat from one of those vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown, which only affects machines running Intel chips.  Major software makers have not issued patches to protect against the second vulnerability, dubbed Spectre, which affects nearly all computer chips made in the last decade, including those from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), and ARM-architecture manufacturers, including Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).  However, Google, Firefox and Microsoft have implemented measures in most web browsers to stop hackers from launching remote attacks using Spectre.  Governments and security experts say they have seen no cyber attacks seeking to exploit either vulnerability, though they expect attempts by hackers as they digest technical data about the security flaws.  One key risk is that hackers will develop code that can infect the personal computers of people visiting malicious websites, said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer of cyber security firm Veracode.  He advised PC owners to install the patches to protect against such potential attacks. Computer servers at large enterprises are less at risk, he said, because those systems are not used to surf the web and can only be infected in a Meltdown attack if a hacker has already breached that network.   Microsoft has issued a patch for its Windows operating system, and Apple desktop users with the most recent operating system are protected. Google has said most of its Chromebook laptops are already protected and that the rest would be soon.  Apple said it planned to release a patch to its Safari web browser within coming days to protect Mac and iOS users from Spectre.   While third-party browsers from Google and others can protect Mac users from Spectre, all major web browsers for Apple\u2019s iOS devices depend on receiving a patch from Apple. Until then, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users will be exposed to potential Spectre attacks while browsing the Web.  Editing by Richard Chang"

          "title": "High tech, low tech: Big U.S. cities embrace twin approach to crime",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gun violence in major U.S. cities fell in 2017 as police used the latest crime-fighting software combined with a revival of old-fashioned community policing to build trust with a skeptical public.  Law enforcement officials and criminologists credit that dual approach with helping extend the decades-long reduction in crime in New York City and reducing gun violence in Chicago by 20 percent in 2017.  Crime has dropped precipitously across the United States since peaking in 1991, though some cities have lagged and others have experienced sudden spikes.  Chicago became a symbol of U.S. gun violence after homicides soared nearly 60 percent in 2016, drawing frequent criticism from Donald Trump during his campaign for the presidency and after he was elected.  Since then, the third-largest U.S. city has revamped policing policies and developed a sophisticated integration of crime-fighting software and hardware such as cameras. It has also built ties to the public through events such as a Halloween party that drew 500 kids to a police station in a high-crime district.  While there is no hard evidence that those initiatives were responsible, homicides in Chicago dropped 16 percent in 2017 to 650. That still outnumbered homicides in the two largest U.S. cities, New York and Los Angeles, combined.  \u201cThere was a promise to never relive 2016,\u201d said Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for Chicago police. \u201cThat was a moment in time we never want to repeat in terms of violence.\u201d   While Chicago has seen volatile swings, New York has experienced a consistent reduction in crime, in sharp contrast with a bygone reputation as the country\u2019s murder and mayhem capital.  On Friday the New York Police Department reported 290 murders in 2017, down 13 percent from 2016 and 87 percent from 1990, when a record 2,262 people were killed.   The New York Police Department called 2017 the safest year in nearly seven decades even as arrests decreased by nearly 400 per day from their high point seven years ago.  Experts do not entirely understand the trend but point to a number of likely factors, including CompStat, the computer analysis of crime data that was developed by New York police in 1994 and has since been replicated in other cities.  CompStat gives police daily reports on how they are performing, enabling them to quickly identify trends and deploy officers to trouble spots.  Data-driven, evidence-based policing has advanced further with the help of crime-predicting software like HunchLab and gunfire-detection system ShotSpotter.  Technology \u201chelps us to link cases quicker, deploy faster and deploy smarter,\u201d Dermot Shea, the NYPD\u2019s chief of crime control strategies, told a news conference on Friday.  The public uproar over police shootings of unarmed black men across the United States in recent years has also convinced police they must adopt neighborhood or community policing.   That aims to improve relationships between police and residents of high-crime districts and reduce animosity toward police to gain more co-operation in solving and preventing crimes.  \u201cTechnology is great ... but I think the best thing going for us is the ability for the police officers to establish and have relationships with the people in this great city,\u201d New York Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said.  Chicago studied the best practices of the New York and Los Angeles police departments, incorporating much of New York\u2019s neighborhood policing model and the use of predictive crime software by Los Angeles.  In February, Chicago rolled out so-called Strategic Decision Support Centers, which integrate gunfire detection and predictive crime software with the city\u2019s extensive network of cameras. Before year\u2019s end the centers had expanded to six of the city\u2019s 22 districts.The program started in notoriously high crime districts such as Englewood and Harrison, where police said crime fell by 43 percent and 26 percent, respectively, in 2017.  Now, when a trigger is pulled, Chicago police are alerted within 30 seconds by ShotSpotter, and the information is relayed to the smartphones of patrol officers within a minute, Guglielmi said.  Meanwhile, with cameras switched on in the gunshot\u2019s vicinity, the same data is run through the HunchLab system. Police and criminologists from the University of Chicago analyze the data in real time, dispatching updates to patrol officers, Guglielmi said.   Chicago police are now frequently responding to incidents as much as three minutes before witnesses report gunfire to the 911 emergency number, he said.  The Chicago experience appears to be \u201ca promising step forward,\u201d said Max Kapustin of the University of Chicago\u2019s Crime Lab.  \u201cCertainly in the case of Chicago and specifically in the district of Englewood, there\u2019s a lot of suggestive evidence that this led to those reductions and seems like a really meaningful way forward for reducing crime,\u201d Kapustin said.

Six Arab foreign ministers met in Amman on Saturday to follow up on earlier decisions taken by the Arab League to counter U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s move in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a decision that overturned decades of U.S. policy on the Middle East.

The Arab League said at the time the move would spur violence throughout the region and described Trump\u2019s announcement as a \u201cdangerous violation of international law\u201d which had no legal impact.  Safadi said the ministers would recommend a series of moves to a full ministerial meeting of the Arab League due later this month.   \u201cWe will confront the decision by seeking a (U.N.) resolution, an international one, to recognize a Palestinian state on 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital,\u201d said Safadi.  He did not elaborate on the timing of the diplomatic moves nor say whether he was referring to a U.N. Security Council or General Assembly resolution.  Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the ministerial meeting would also discuss Washington\u2019s role in future Arab-Israeli peacemaking that members states said was now jeopardized by what they see as U.S. bias towards Israel.  \u201cWe want to lessen any losses on the Palestinian side and lessen the Israeli gains,\u201d Aboul Gheit added.  Arab states would also discuss whether to convene an extraordinary summit of their leaders or wait until a scheduled summit in the Saudi capital Riyadh at the end of March, he added.      Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem has infuriated the Arab world and upset Western allies, who say it is a blow to peace efforts and risks sparking more violence in the region.  Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital.  Most countries consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it from Jordan in a 1967 war, to be occupied territory, and say the status of the city should be decided at future Israeli-Palestinian talks.  On Dec. 18, the United States blocked a United Nations Security Council call for Trump\u2019s declaration on Jerusalem to be withdrawn.  Three days later, more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favor of a United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.  In 2012, the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine in a resolution that said the status of Jerusalem should be resolved through negotiations.

          "body": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - The real estate company of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its use of a federal program that grants visas to wealthy foreigners investing in the United States, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.  Kushner Cos was asked by the SEC for information on its use of the visa program, known as EB-5, in May 2017, according to a person the Journal said was familiar with the matter.  The EB-5 visa is a method for eligible immigrants to become lawful permanent residents, or \u201cgreen card\u201d holders, by investing at least $500,000 into a business in the United States that will employ 10 or more American workers. Most holders are wealthy Chinese individuals.  The Journal said the company also received a separate request from New York federal prosecutors in the same month for information on development projects financed in part by the EB-5 program.  Kushner, Kushner Cos, the White House and New York prosecutors did not reply to requests for comment from Reuters. The SEC could not be reached for comment.  Kushner Cos referred the Journal to a previous statement on its use of the EB-5 program: \u201cKushner Cos utilized the program, fully complied with its rules and regulations, and did nothing improper. We are cooperating with legal requests for information.\u201d  The exact subject of the SEC\u2019s inquiry, or whether it identified particular projects, is not clear, the Journal reported.  The Kushners use of EB-5 visas to raise cash to finance developments came to broad attention in May last year, when Kushner\u2019s sister, Nicole Kushner, spoke at a publicly advertised event in Shanghai to attract Chinese investment into a two-tower luxury apartment complex in New Jersey, called One Journal Square, being developed jointly by Kushner Cos and KABR Group. The company later apologized for mentioning Jared Kushner\u2019s name while wooing investors.  The developers were seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of funding for the project, from investors through the EB-5 visa program, according to marketing materials posted by the event\u2019s organizer, immigration agency Qiaowai, Reuters reported at the time.  Kushner Cos is not a publicly traded company but the EB-5 is considered a securities offering, the Journal said, hence the SEC\u2019s interest.  Kushner resigned from his role leading Kushner Cos when he was appointed Trump\u2019s senior White House adviser early last year but still owns a stake in parts of the business, according to his most recent personal financial disclosure form, the Journal said.

Bashir Ahmed had 21 points and seven rebounds for the injury-riddled Red Storm, which dropped to 0-4 in Big East play.

          "body": "TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Nigeria is starting flights to evacuate thousands of its citizens from Libya which will continue until all those wanting to return home have done so, its foreign minister said on Saturday.    Nigerians have recently been the largest national group among African migrants traveling to Libya and trying to cross from there to Italy by sea.  Since local armed factions and Libya\u2019s coastguard began blocking more migrants from leaving in July last year, large numbers have been trapped in Libya, where they often face dire conditions and abuse, including forced labor.  The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has in recent months accelerated a \u201cvoluntary returns\u201d program to repatriate migrants from a number of countries.

Facilitating voluntary returns could also be complicated by lack of access, Onyema said.

Libya has been in turmoil since a 2011 uprising, with rival governments and armed factions vying for power. Onyema was hosted by the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, which has struggled to assert its authority on the ground.  Slightly fewer than half as many migrants reached Europe by sea in 2017 than 2016, the IOM said on Friday, largely due to a drop in numbers crossing from Libya.

          "body": "The Philadelphia Flyers scored two goals in the first period, two in the second and held on for a 6-3 victory over the St. Louis Blues on Saturday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.  Sean Couturier scored two goals, Scott Laughton, Claude Giroux, Jordan Weal and Wayne Simmonds each scored one goal and the Flyers won their second straight game, improving to 18-15-8. The Flyers defeated the New York Islanders 6-4 on Thursday night. Giroux added a pair of assists.  Philadelphia goaltender Brian Elliott was solid in his 16th straight start, making 28 saves.  The Blues had won three games in a row, including a 2-1 victory over the Las Vegas Golden Knights on Thursday. They registered a mere seven shots in the first period and had trouble breaking through early against Elliott.  St. Louis fell to 26-16-2 and struggled to generate much movement in the offensive zone, though Ivan Barbashev scored his first goal of the season. Paul Stastny cut the lead in half \u2014 4-2 \u2014 just 12 seconds into the third. Colton Parayko tipped home a shot with 4:31 remaining to get the Blues within 5-3.  Simmonds cleared space in front of the net and sent home a rebound with 8:42 left for a 5-2 Flyers lead.  Weal\u2019s goal gave the Flyers a commanding 3-0 advantage with 11:28 remaining in the second on Jakub Voracek\u2019s league-leading 41st assist of the season.  Couturier notched his 20th goal slightly more than three minutes later for a four-goal lead. It\u2019s the first time in Couturier\u2019s career that he has reached the 20-goal mark. He added an empty-netter for his 21st in the waning seconds.  The Blues got on the board when Barbashev scored with 5:04 left in the second.  The Flyers came out very aggressive from the time the puck dropped and went ahead 1-0 with 17:45 left in the first on an unassisted goal by Laughton.  Philadelphia went ahead 2-0 just under five minutes later when Giroux scored and ended the period ahead in shots on goal, 16-7.  The Flyers improved to 12-3-3 this season when scoring first, and they finished the period with a lead for just the second time in the last 21 games.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "title": "John Young, 'most experienced' U.S. astronaut, dies at 87",
          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. astronaut John Young, who walked on the moon in 1972 and even smuggled a corned beef sandwich into orbit during a career that made him the only person to fly with three NASA space programs, has died at age 87, officials said on Saturday.      Young, who went to space six times, died on Friday night at his home in Houston following complications from pneumonia, National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman Allard Beutel said in an email.   The former U.S. Navy test pilot was the ninth person to set foot on the moon, an experience shared by three others after Young. He eventually became one of the most accomplished astronauts in the history of the U.S. space program.  He flew into space twice during NASA\u2019s Gemini program in the mid-1960s, twice on the Apollo lunar missions and twice on space shuttles in the 1980s. He was the only person to fly on all three types of programs.  \u201cAstronaut John Young\u2019s storied career spanned three generations of spaceflight. We will stand on his shoulders as we look toward the next human frontier,\u201d NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot said in a statement.  Young, described in a NASA tweet as \u201cour most experienced astronaut,\u201d retired in 2004 after 42 years with the U.S. space agency.  The Apollo 16 mission in April 1972, his fourth space flight, took Young to the lunar surface.  As mission commander, he and crewmate Charles Duke explored the moon\u2019s Descartes Highlands region, gathering 200 pounds (90 kg) of rock and soil samples and driving more than 16 miles (26 km) in the lunar rover to sites such as Spook Crater.  Recalling his lunar exploits, Young told the Houston Chronicle in 2004: \u201cOne-sixth gravity on the surface of the moon is just delightful. It\u2019s not like being in zero gravity, you know. You can drop a pencil in zero gravity and look for it for three days. In one-sixth gravity, you just look down and there it is.\u201d  Young\u2019s first time in space came in 1965 with the Gemini 3 mission that took him and astronaut Gus Grissom into Earth orbit in the first two-person U.S. space jaunt.  It was on this mission that Young pulled his sandwich stunt, which did not make NASA brass happy but certainly pleased Grissom, the recipient of the snack.  Astronaut Wally Schirra, who was not flying on the mission, bought the corned beef sandwich on rye bread from a delicatessen in Cocoa Beach, Florida, and asked Young to give it to Grissom in space. During the flight, as they discussed the food provided for the mission, Young handed Grissom the sandwich.  NASA later rebuked Young for the antics, which generated criticism from lawmakers and the media, but his career did not suffer.  His May 1969 Apollo 10 mission served as a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for the historic Apollo 11 mission two months later in which Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon. Young and his crew undertook each aspect of that subsequent mission except for an actual moon landing.  Young\u2019s fifth space mission was as commander of the inaugural flight of NASA\u2019s first space shuttle, Columbia, in 1981. He became the first person to fly six space missions in 1983, when he commanded Columbia on the first Spacelab trek, with the crew performing more than 70 scientific experiments.  He never went to space again. Young had been due to command a 1986 flight that was canceled after the explosion of the shuttle Challenger earlier that year.   \u201cJohn was more than a good friend,\u201d former President George H.W. Bush said in a statement. \u201cHe was a fearless patriot whose courage and commitment to duty helped our nation push back the horizon of discovery at a critical time.\u201d  Young was born on Sept. 24, 1930, in San Francisco and grew up in Orlando, Florida. After receiving a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1952, he entered the Navy and graduated from its test pilot school. NASA picked him in 1962 for its astronaut program.  Reporting and writing by Will Dunham; Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Bill Trott and Lisa Von Ahn"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday rejected an author\u2019s accusations that he is mentally unfit for office and said his business career and election victory showed he is \u201ca very stable genius.\u201d  Michael Wolff, who was granted unusually wide access to the White House during much of Trump\u2019s first year, has said in promoting his book that Trump is unfit for the presidency. He told BBC Radio in an interview broadcast on Saturday that his book is creating \u201cthe perception and the understanding that will finally end ... this presidency.\u201d  Trump battled back in a series of extraordinary morning posts on Twitter, which appeared to catch some in his inner circle off guard.  Trump said Democratic critics and the U.S. news media were bringing up the \u201cold Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence\u201d since they have not been able to bring him down in other ways.  Reagan, a Republican who was the U.S. president from 1981-1989, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 1994 and died in 2004.  \u201cActually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart,\u201d said Trump, a former reality TV star and developer.  \u201cI went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star ... to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius ... and a very stable genius at that!\u201d  Trump, 71, sent the tweets from the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, where he discussed a legislative agenda for the year with Republican congressional leaders and many Cabinet secretaries.  Wolff\u2019s book, \u201cFire and Fury - Inside the Trump White House,\u201d portrays Trump as unfocused, unprepared and petty while presiding over a chaotic White House.  Trump, answering questions from reporters at Camp David after the meeting, called Wolff a \u201cfraud\u201d and said the book is \u201ca complete work of fiction.\u201d  \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d he said.  Trump said he never granted Wolff an interview for the book and blamed former adviser Steve Bannon, who he called \u201cSloppy Steve,\u201d for granting Wolff access at the White House. Wolff has said he spoke to Trump but that the president may not have known he was being interviewed.  The tweets were another sign of Trump\u2019s frustration at what he views as unfair treatment by the news media of his presidency amid a federal investigation into whether he or his campaign aides colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, in which he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.  White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told reporters at Camp David that he had not been aware of Trump\u2019s morning tweets. Kelly said Trump did not seem angry and on Friday night had watched a new movie, \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d about legendary circus promoter P.T. Barnum, with the lawmakers.  Trump, asked about a New York Times report that his aides had pressured Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, said: \u201cEverything I\u2019ve done has been 100 percent proper.\u201d  Trump, who has often criticized Sessions of his performance as attorney general, said he nonetheless supports him. Sessions had not been invited to the weekend retreat.  Wolff\u2019s book has proved to be another shock to the system for Trump and his top aides, coming just as he starts his second year in office.  Wolff told NBC News on Friday that White House staff treated Trump like a child.  \u201cThe one description that everyone gave, everyone has in common \u2014 they all say he is like a child,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cAnd what they mean by that, he has a need for immediate gratification. It\u2019s all about him.  \u201cThis man does not read, does not listen. He\u2019s like a pinball, just shooting off the sides.\u201d  Trump is to undergo the first physical examination of his presidency on Jan. 12. The exam was announced on Dec. 7 after questions arose about Trump\u2019s health when he slurred part of a speech announcing that the United States recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  White House officials and Trump\u2019s high-profile supporters have launched an effort to raise doubts about Wolff\u2019s credibility. White House spokesman Sarah Sanders said earlier in the week that the book includes \u201cmistake after mistake after mistake.\u201d  Additional reporting by James Oliphant in Camp David, Maryland; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Bill Trott"

          "body": "Yante Maten dominated on the inside and outside, and Georgia rolled over Alabama 65-46 Saturday in what Bulldog fans hope will be a preview of Monday\u2019s meeting with the Crimson Tide on the gridiron.  Alabama and Georgia play Monday in the College Football Playoff national championship at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.  It was all Bulldogs (11-3, 2-1 SEC) on Saturday on the hardwood at Stegeman Coliseum in Athens, Ga.  Maten finished with 26 points and 11 rebounds for his 23rd career double-double and seventh this season. The senior forward got off to a hot start, hitting four 3-pointers in the first half and helping Georgia open a commanding lead over the shorthanded Crimson Tide, who were without key contributor Dazon Ingram.  Ingram, Alabama\u2019s second-leading rebounder, was ruled out with the flu.  Without Ingram and his other teammates struggling offensively, Collin Sexton tried to keep the Tide in the game. Sexton scored Alabama\u2019s first seven points and finished with 15 points in the first half. But the Crimson Tide still trailed 44-24 at halftime.  Sexton led Alabama (9-6, 1-2 SEC) with 23 points. No other Alabama player reached double figures.  Alabama cut the Georgia lead to 16 early in the second half but never threatened a serious comeback. The Crimson Tide shot 29.8 percent from the floor, were outrebounded 49-31 and held to a season-low 46 points.  Georgia freshman guard Rayshaun Hammonds added 13 points and eight rebounds for the Bulldogs, who bounced back from a hard-fought loss at No. 16 Kentucky last week. Maten also had three assists and helped the Bulldogs\u2019 break the Alabama full-court press several times.  Georgia picked up its second straight conference win and improved to 8-0 at home. The Bulldogs hit the road Wednesday to take on Missouri.  The Crimson Tide opened SEC play with an upset of No. 5 Texas A&M, but have dropped two straight conference games since. They\u2019ll try to right the ship Tuesday, when South Carolina comes to Tuscaloosa, Ala.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "title": "Murray can get back if he puts his mind to it: Wilander",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Former world number one Andy Murray can return to the top of the sport despite the hip injury that forced him to pull out of the Australian Open this week as long as his mind is willing, according to tennis great Mats Wilander.  Three-times grand slam champion Murray has not played a competitive match since losing a Wimbledon quarter-final to American Sam Querrey in July and may need surgery to cure a problem that threatens his career.  However, seven-times major winner Wilander believes if the Scot sets his mind on it, he can overcome the physical battle that awaits over the next few crucial months.  \u201cOf course he can (come back),\u201d Swede Wilander, who will host his popular \u2018Game, Set and Mats\u2019 show for Eurosport during the Australian Open, told Reuters by phone.  \u201cHave the surgery and see how things go. He\u2019s a hard enough worker and so talented that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem for him to come back as long as his mind wants him to come back.  \u201cThat\u2019s the thing you never really know when you have a surgery and take time off.\u201d  Murray, who has slipped to 16th in the world from number one in September, has battled back from injury before, most notably when he took time off for lower back surgery in 2013.  He returned to play some of his best tennis, winning a second Wimbledon crown in 2016, gold at the Rio Olympics and climbing to the top of the ATP rankings.  That knowledge will drive him on again, Wilander said.  \u201cWith Murray I think he draw on past experiences and look at how after he had his back surgery he came back and was a better player and got to number one in the world,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf he can get himself 100 percent fit he can come back with no pressure because he already has three slams and it won\u2019t be about rankings then, just getting back to a level where he can challenge for big titles.\u201d  Wilander said it should be no surprise that the top players are struggling with injuries, as their careers are now longer.  Novak Djokovic (elbow) and Rafael Nadal (knee) are both battling for full fitness ahead of the Australian Open while Stan Wawrinka, another 30 something, is returning from a knee injury, as Roger Federer did last year in stunning fashion.  \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily an age thing but it\u2019s more about miles on the clock,\u201d Wilander said.  Murray, 30, is yet to decide whether or not he needs surgery, although he hinted last week that it may his only option after a six-month rehab failed to cure the problem.

          "body": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Mobs gathered outside some Caracas supermarkets on Saturday after the government ordered shops to slash prices, creating chaos as desperate Venezuelans leapt at the chance to buy cheaper food as the country\u2019s worsening economy causes severe shortages.  The leftist administration of President Nicolas Maduro ordered more than 200 supermarkets to cut prices back to last month\u2019s levels - a tall order in a country where many prices change daily due to the world\u2019s fastest inflation rate.  News of the discounts spread like wildfire, leading hundreds to mass in front of stores before daybreak. When one major supermarket in wealthier eastern Caracas did not open for hours, people began pounding on the storefront.  \u201cWe\u2019re hungry! We want food!\u201d screamed the crowd, which included babies, pensioners and children with disabilities.  \u201cThis scares me, but what can I do?\u201d said Francisco Guaita, a carpenter hoping to find food for his three children, over the shouts and pushes. \u201cThis is the worst government. We want Maduro out.\u201d  Critics say Maduro is playing with fire in the oil-rich nation, where millions are unable to eat three square meals a day and malnutrition is on the rise, saying his policy will dissuade supermarkets from stocking their shelves and could trigger looting.  The socialist, who was narrowly elected to replace the late Hugo Chavez in 2013, counters that he is a victim of a U.S.-led \u201ceconomic war\u201d in which businesses hoard food and stoke prices to destabilize his government.   The state agency in charge of ensuring \u201cfair prices\u201d ordered some 214 supermarkets owned by 26 chains to drop their prices, pro-government newspaper Ultimas Noticias reported on Saturday.  \u201cThis Tuesday we received an accusation and we deployed immediately. We confirmed that the big chains were increasing prices without any justification, because they were doing it for products that were in stock, not new ones,\u201d William Contreras, the head of the agency known as Sundde, told the paper.  Several Venezuelans interviewed in line outside the supermarket in eastern Caracas said they thought Maduro\u2019s policies were a disaster. But they still planned to take advantage of lower prices because they were not able to properly feed their families otherwise.  \u201cIt\u2019s bad policy. But we have to eat,\u201d said Edgar Romero, a 45-year-old drummer who supported Chavez but said he has soured on Maduro, as he stood in line under the sizzling sun.  Armed National Guard soldiers later arrived at the store and ordered people into clear lines, warning that they would not be allowed in otherwise. They eventually let the crowd through in small groups just before midday, but people quickly emerged disappointed as only crackers and washing liquid were discounted.  \u201cI can\u2019t feed my kids with this,\u201d said Jesus Gudino, a 29-year-old moto-taxi driver and father of three, sneering at the small plastic bag in his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been here since 4 a.m. This is a mockery. What can I do? I have to leave this country.\u201d  Additional reporting by Andreina Aponte; Editing by Bill Trott and Bill Rigby"

The Hokies dropped their first two games of the conference season at Syracuse and at home to arch rival Virginia, but managed to rebound at home against Pitt.  The Hokies (12-4, 1-2) held a 39-34 lead at halftime and built their lead to 11 points at 45-34 with 18:15 remaining in the game, but the Panthers roared back.  Pitt responded with a 17-6 run to tie the game at 51-51 with 12:37 remaining after a pair of free throws by junior guard Jared Wilson-Frame.  But it was all Virginia Tech after that.  The Hokies scored the next six points to take a 57-51 lead with 11:10 left, and then after Pitt cut its deficit to three points at 61-58 with 6:16 remaining, Virginia Tech answered with another 6-0 run to take a 67-58 lead with 5:34 remaining.  Leading 69-64 with 2:22 remaining, Virginia Tech put the game away with a 10-0 run to take a 79-64 lead with 58 seconds left.  Sophomore forward Kerry Blackshear, Jr. was the go-to player for the Hokies, scoring 31 points on 12 of 16 shooting from the field.  Freshman Nickeil Alexander-Walker scored 16 points, junior guard Ahmed Hill scored 15 points and junior guard Justin Robinson had 11 points and 10 rebounds for Virginia Tech, which will next play at Wake Forest on Wednesday.  Wilson-Frame came off of the bench to score 20 points to lead Pitt, which fell to 8-8 overall and 0-3 in conference play following losses to Miami (Fla.) and Louisville.  The Panthers stayed in the game largely because of 3-point shooting, going 12 of 26 from 3-point range to 4 of 23 for Virginia Tech.  An 0-4 start for Pitt looks likely since the Panthers will next host No. 2 Duke on Wednesday.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Monfils had lost three times in the final, most recently in 2014 against Rafa Nadal, but left nothing to chance this time as he outclassed Rublev in 61 minutes.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Struggling British building and services company Carillion (CLLN.L), which is involved in Britain\u2019s planned high-speed rail link HS2, said on Saturday it will meet creditors on Wednesday as it seeks a financial rescue plan.  Carillion, a provider of infrastructure projects in several countries beyond Britain, has been fighting for its survival after costly contract delays and a downturn in new business.   It is also under investigation by regulators over \u201cthe timeliness and content\u201d of statements it made before it issued a profit warning in July, the first of three such warnings issued in quick succession.  \u201cThe group is currently finalizing its business plan, which it intends to present to its financial creditors and certain other stakeholders on Jan. 10, in line with the previously announced timetable,\u201d a company spokesman said.  Carillion was in talks to \u201creduce net debt and recapitalize and/or restructure the group\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d he said.  \u201cOnce finalised, the business plan will provide the basis for the agreement of a proposal to restore Carillion\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d the spokesman said.  Earlier on Saturday, Sky News said Carillion\u2019s rescue plan would involve handing back loss-making contracts, revising the terms of others and possibly accepting government financial support if it cannot secure private funding.  That government support could be a loan on commercial terms, a deal to reprice some contracts, or to allow Carillion to hand back loss-making work to the government, Sky News said, quoting unidentified sources.  Analysts have estimated the company has debt including provisions, pensions and accounts payable of about 1.5 billion pounds ($2.04 billion) compared with its market capitalization of about 70 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters data.  In December, Carillion said discussions with stakeholders about its options to cut debt and avoid a breach of debt covenants were \u201cprogressing well\u201d.   Sky News said the company faced a funding gap of hundreds of millions of pounds and the precise size of the shortfall depended on whether it was able to get out of loss-making contracts. The company\u2019s lenders included Barclays (BARC.L), HSBC (HSBA.L) and Santander UK (SAN.MC), it said.  Carillion, which operates in Canada and the Middle East as well as Britain and employs more than 30,000 people, last month brought forward the start date for new chief executive Andrew Davies to Jan. 22.

          "title": "UPDATE 1-UK's Carillion to discuss rescue with creditors on Jan. 10",
          "body": "(Updates with comment from company spokesman)  LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Struggling British building and services company Carillion, which is involved in Britain\u2019s planned high-speed rail link HS2, said on Saturday it will meet creditors on Wednesday as it seeks a financial rescue plan.  Carillion, a provider of infrastructure projects in several countries beyond Britain, has been fighting for its survival after costly contract delays and a downturn in new business.  It is also under investigation by regulators over \u201cthe timeliness and content\u201d of statements it made before it issued a profit warning in July, the first of three such warnings issued in quick succession.  \u201cThe group is currently finalising its business plan, which it intends to present to its financial creditors and certain other stakeholders on Jan. 10, in line with the previously announced timetable,\u201d a company spokesman said.  Carillion was in talks to \u201creduce net debt and recapitalise and/or restructure the group\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d he said.  \u201cOnce finalised, the business plan will provide the basis for the agreement of a proposal to restore Carillion\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d the spokesman said.  Earlier on Saturday, Sky News said Carillion\u2019s rescue plan would involve handing back loss-making contracts, revising the terms of others and possibly accepting government financial support if it cannot secure private funding.  That government support could be a loan on commercial terms, a deal to reprice some contracts, or to allow Carillion to hand back loss-making work to the government, Sky News said, quoting unidentified sources.  Analysts have estimated the company has debt including provisions, pensions and accounts payable of about 1.5 billion pounds ($2.04 billion) compared with its market capitalisation of about 70 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters data.  In December, Carillion said discussions with stakeholders about its options to cut debt and avoid a breach of debt covenants were \u201cprogressing well\u201d.  Sky News said the company faced a funding gap of hundreds of millions of pounds and the precise size of the shortfall depended on whether it was able to get out of loss-making contracts. The company\u2019s lenders included Barclays, HSBC and Santander UK, it said.  Carillion, which operates in Canada and the Middle East as well as Britain and employs more than 30,000 people, last month brought forward the start date for new chief executive Andrew Davies to Jan. 22.

          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel supports a cut in U.S. funding for a U.N. agency that provides aid to Palestinian refugees - a possibility raised by President Donald Trump - but prefers it be carried out gradually, a senior Israeli official said on Saturday.  Trump threatened earlier this week to withhold future aid payments to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) over what he called the Palestinians\u2019 unwillingness to talk peace with Israel.  The idea, condemned as blackmail by Palestinians, was initially met with mixed reactions in Israel, with some officials warning of the dangers in cutting off financial assistance to the Palestinians.  \u201cPrime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) supports a gradual cut to UNRWA,\u201d said the senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  The Axios news website reported on Friday that the United States had frozen $125 million in funding for UNRWA, but a State Department official said no decision had been made.  Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a brief statement that the premier \u201csupports President Trump\u2019s critical approach and believes that practical steps should be taken to change the situation in which UNRWA is perpetuating the Palestinian refugee problem rather than resolving it.\u201d  UNRWA supports much of the population in the Gaza Strip and a cut to its budget could ramp up tensions with Israel, a main conduit for aid into the territory.  The United States is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA\u2019s website.  Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Ros Russell"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L)(UNc.AS) plans to close its Colman\u2019s mustard factory in the English city of Norwich next year, after more than 160 years, affecting 113 jobs.  Production of the condiment will likely start to be transferred this year to other British sites including Burton upon Trent, where Marmite and Bovril are made, with some packing moving to Germany, the company said on Thursday.  The decision follows a review launched in October when UK soft drink maker Britvic (BVIC.L) announced the closure of its Norwich factory, on a site co-owned with Unilever.  Britvic\u2019s decision had \u201cserious implications\u201d for Unilever, a company spokeswoman said in a statement.  About 40 of the jobs will transfer to Burton, while 25 will be created in Norwich by a new facility for production and packing of Colman\u2019s mustard powder, mustard milling and mint processing, Unilever said. The company will also continue to source its mint and mustard locally, it said.   The move comes as British businesses prepare for the country\u2019s exit from the European Union, and as Unilever also reviews its dual-headed Anglo-Dutch structure.   \u201cThe government is disappointed Unilever has decided to close its Norwich plant, though we welcome Unilever\u2019s commitment to mustard milling and mint production in Norwich,\u201d a spokesman for the British government said, adding that it will work closely with the company, local government officials and unions throughout the consultation period.  Jeremiah Colman began selling mustard near Norwich in 1814. His great-nephew Jeremiah James Colman established the factory there in 1858. Unilever acquired the business in 1995 from what is now Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L).   Reporting by Martinne Geller, editing by David Evans and Adrian Croft"

          "title": "Israel offers to pay African migrants to leave, threatens jail",
          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Wednesday it would pay thousands of African migrants living illegally in the country to leave, threatening them with jail if they are caught after the end of March.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in public remarks at a cabinet meeting on the payment program, said a barrier Israel completed in 2013 along its border with Egypt had effectively cut off a stream of \u201cillegal infiltrators\u201d from Africa after some 60,000 crossed the desert frontier.  The vast majority came from Eritrea and Sudan and many said they fled war and persecution as well as economic hardship, but Israel treats them as economic migrants.  The plan launched this week offers African migrants a $3,500 payment from the Israeli government and a free air ticket to return home or go to \u201cthird countries\u201d, which rights groups identified as Rwanda and Uganda.  \u201cWe have expelled about 20,000 and now the mission is to get the rest out,\u201d Netanyahu said.  An immigration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there are some 38,000 migrants living illegally in Israel, and some 1,420 are being held in two detention centers.  \u201cBeyond the end of March, those who leave voluntarily will receive a significantly smaller payment that will shrink even more with time, and enforcement measures will begin,\u201d the official said, referring to incarceration.   Some have lived for years in Israel and work in low-paying jobs that many Israelis shun. Israel has granted asylum to fewer than one percent of those who have applied and has a years-long backlog of applicants.  Rights groups have accused Israel of being slow to process African migrants\u2019 asylum requests as a matter of policy and denying legitimate claims to the status.  Netanyahu has called the migrants\u2019 presence a threat to Israel\u2019s social fabric and Jewish character, and one government minister has referred to them as \u201ca cancer\u201d.  Teklit Michael, a 29-asylum seeker from Eritrea living in Tel Aviv, said in response to the Israeli plan that paying money to other governments to take in Africans was akin to \u201chuman trafficking and smuggling\u201d.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know what is waiting for us (in Rwanda and Uganda),\u201d he told Reuters by telephone. \u201cThey prefer now to stay in prison (in Israel) instead.\u201d  In his remarks, Netanyahu cited the large presence of African migrants in Tel Aviv\u2019s poorer neighborhoods, where he said \u201cveteran residents\u201d - a reference to Israelis - no longer feel safe.  \u201cSo today, we are keeping our promise to restore calm, a sense of personal security and law and order to the residents of south Tel Aviv and those in many other neighborhoods,\u201d he said.

          "body": "GOSLAR, Germany (Reuters) - Germany and Turkey\u2019s foreign ministers on Saturday agreed to pull out all the stops to improve ties that have soured due to disputes over Ankara\u2019s post-coup crackdown and the arrests of German citizens in Turkey, but they stressed differences remain.  Meeting in an ornate imperial palace in central Germany, the pair said they were keen to make amends after falling out as Ankara rounded up suspected supporters of a failed 2016 coup, a comedian mocked Turkey\u2019s president and a German-Turkish journalist was detained without charge.  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel pointed to historic links between the countries including the role Turkish guest workers played in rebuilding Germany after World War Two, Turkey\u2019s hospitality in taking in German refugees during the Nazi era and the 3 million-strong Turkish community here.  \u201cWe\u2019ve both made it our business to do everything we can to overcome the difficulties there have been in German-Turkish relations and to find more common ground in the future by remembering everything that binds us together,\u201d Gabriel said.  German politicians have been outspoken critics of Turkey\u2019s post-coup crackdown, in which some 50,000 people have been arrested pending trial and 150,000, including teachers, judges and soldiers, have been sacked or suspended from their jobs.  Turkey says the crackdown, targeting alleged supporters of a Muslim network it blames for the coup, is necessary on security grounds. Ankara has criticized Germany\u2019s refusal to hand over asylum seekers it says were involved in the failed putsch.   Adding to the tension, the German government believes seven Germans, of whom four have dual citizenship, are being held in prison in Turkey for political reasons.  But in a sign of recovering relations, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the NATO allies believed they could overcome recent escalations in tension through dialogue.   Cavusoglu said Turkey and Germany shared similar views on conflict-hit Middle East countries and they were cooperating on humanitarian issues like migration.  During a working lunch on Saturday, he and Gabriel would discuss steps they can take together in future, Cavusoglu said.  But the pair acknowledged areas of disagreement. Cavusoglu said one bone of contention was whether Turkey should be allowed to join the European Union - a move that Germany opposes - but he sounded a conciliatory note.  \u201cThere is benefit in pushing our disagreements aside and continuing on our path. We should focus on issues that serve as win-win for our countries, like the Customs Union,\u201d he said.  One of the disputes between Berlin and Ankara centers around the arrest of Deniz Yucel, a reporter for German newspaper Die Welt. Turkish authorities accuse him of spreading propaganda for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). He denies the charge.  Gabriel said he had discussed thorny issues including Yucel\u2019s case with Cavusoglu but did not give details.  Germany is Turkey\u2019s biggest trade partner but exports from Europe\u2019s largest economy to Turkey dropped by 5.9 percent year-on-year in the first nine months of 2017.  Gabriel told magazine Der Spiegel on Friday Germany had refused to authorize \u201ca large number of arms exports\u201d to Turkey and that would remain the case until Yucel\u2019s case was resolved.  But on Saturday he said the German government would consider whether to deliver mine protection gear for armored vehicles in Turkey, an issue not linked to arrests, he said.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drone sales in 2017 topped $1 billion for the first time ever, but don\u2019t raise a glass too quickly if you are in New Jersey, where lawmakers are poised to outlaw drunken droning next week.  It is one of a wave of U.S. states moving to bring the unmanned aircrafts\u2019 high-flying fun back to earth.  New Jersey\u2019s Assembly is slated to vote on a bill approved by the state Senate to ban inebriated or drugged droning, as well as to outlaw flying unmanned aircraft systems over prisons and in pursuit of wildlife. The vote was set for Thursday but postponed until Monday because of a severe snowstorm that triggered a state of emergency in New Jersey.   \u201cIt\u2019s basically like flying a blender,\u201d said John Sullivan, 41, of New York, a drone buff and aerial cinematographer. He said he opposed drunk droning but also fretted about regulatory overreach. \u201cIf I had like one drink, I\u2019d be hesitant to even fly it.\u201d  A 2015 drone crash on the White House lawn fueled debate in the U.S. Congress over the need for drone regulations.  It was a drunken, off-duty employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency who flew the 2-foot-by-2-foot (60 cm by 60 cm) \u201cquadcopter\u201d from a friend\u2019s apartment balcony and lost control of it over the grounds surrounding the White House, the New York Times reported.  New statistics set for release next week show 3.1 million drones were sold in the United States last year, up 28 percent from 2016, said Richard Kowalski, manager for the Consumer Technology Association.   \u201cThis was the first year that drone revenues reached $1 billion,\u201d Kowalksi said in an email.  At least 38 states are considering restrictions on the devices this legislative year, including Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina, said Amanda Essex, senior policy specialist for the National Conference of State Legislatures.  \u201cLike any technology, drones have the ability to be used for good, but they also provide new opportunities for bad actors,\u201d said Assemblywoman Annette Quijano of Elizabeth, New Jersey. She backed the bill, which would impose a punishment of up to six months prison and a $1,000 fine for drunk droning.  If the Assembly passes the bill, Governor Chris Christie must sign it into law before he leaves office in less than two weeks or the legislation is dead, said Quijano\u2019s Chief of Staff Shane Derris.  Already, nine states prohibit drones from operating near or over prisons, including Arizona, Louisiana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin, Essex said.  A drone carrying wire cutters and a cell phone likely aided a prisoner\u2019s escape in July from a maximum security prison in South Carolina, officials said.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Struggling British building and services company Carillion (CLLN.L), which is involved in Britain\u2019s planned high-speed rail link HS2, said on Saturday it will meet creditors on Wednesday as it seeks a financial rescue plan.  Carillion, a provider of infrastructure projects in several countries beyond Britain, has been fighting for its survival after costly contract delays and a downturn in new business.   It is also under investigation by regulators over \u201cthe timeliness and content\u201d of statements it made before it issued a profit warning in July, the first of three such warnings issued in quick succession.  \u201cThe group is currently finalizing its business plan, which it intends to present to its financial creditors and certain other stakeholders on Jan. 10, in line with the previously announced timetable,\u201d a company spokesman said.  Carillion was in talks to \u201creduce net debt and recapitalize and/or restructure the group\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d he said.  \u201cOnce finalised, the business plan will provide the basis for the agreement of a proposal to restore Carillion\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d the spokesman said.  Earlier on Saturday, Sky News said Carillion\u2019s rescue plan would involve handing back loss-making contracts, revising the terms of others and possibly accepting government financial support if it cannot secure private funding.  That government support could be a loan on commercial terms, a deal to reprice some contracts, or to allow Carillion to hand back loss-making work to the government, Sky News said, quoting unidentified sources.  Analysts have estimated the company has debt including provisions, pensions and accounts payable of about 1.5 billion pounds ($2.04 billion) compared with its market capitalization of about 70 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters data.  In December, Carillion said discussions with stakeholders about its options to cut debt and avoid a breach of debt covenants were \u201cprogressing well\u201d.   Sky News said the company faced a funding gap of hundreds of millions of pounds and the precise size of the shortfall depended on whether it was able to get out of loss-making contracts. The company\u2019s lenders included Barclays (BARC.L), HSBC (HSBA.L) and Santander UK (SAN.MC), it said.  Carillion, which operates in Canada and the Middle East as well as Britain and employs more than 30,000 people, last month brought forward the start date for new chief executive Andrew Davies to Jan. 22.

          "body": "ADELBODEN, Switzerland (Reuters) - Austrian Marcel Hirscher continued his seemingly inevitable march towards a seventh overall World Cup title by winning the giant slalom at Adelboden on Saturday, despite nearly crashing near the end of his second run.  Hirscher, who will be aiming to add a first Olympic gold in Pyeongchang next month to his glittering array of titles, momentarily lost control on the steepest part of the course, costing him crucial seconds as he slipped and slithered.   Yet he still managed to recover and pip Henrik Kristoffersen by 0.17 seconds to win his sixth World Cup race of the season  \u2014 three in the giant slalom and three in the slalom.  Frenchman Alexis Pinturault was third.  Bemused Norwegian Kristoffersen was left to contemplate his sixth second place of the season, with Hirscher the winner in four of those races.  Kristoffersen shook his head and raised his hands in the air in exasperation when he saw his rival\u2019s time.  \u201cIt was a real fight... Marcel made a big mistake near the bottom, and so did I, and at the moment he is just better,\u201d Kristoffersen told reporters.  Hirscher, who has 774 points, extended his lead in the overall standings to 114 over Kristoffersen with Pinturault third on 502.  In mild, sunny conditions, Hirscher was fastest on the first run with one minute 10.53 and although his second leg of 1:18.10 was only fifth fastest, it was still enough for the 51st World Cup win of his career.  The 28-year-old\u2019s form is even more remarkable considering he broke his ankle in a training injury in August.  Writing by Brian Homewood; editing by Ken Ferris"

The Greek Orthodox church is one of the biggest private landowners in the Holy Land and in recent years has stirred controversy both among Israelis and Palestinians by trying to sell prime assets to private investors.  Hundreds of Palestinians blocked Patriarch Theophilos III\u2019s convoy as he drove to a church in Bethlehem to attend an Orthodox Christmas mass.  Protestors threw stones and water bottles and pounded his car with their fists, chanting \u201ctraitor, traitor,\u201d before Palestinian security forces pushed them away. Three cars in the convoy, but not the Patriarch\u2019s vehicle, had their windows smashed.  Demonstrator Elyeef Sayegh said: \u201cWhat happened today is a message to the Palestinian Authority and to Jordan that we will not allow this traitor to stay in the Church.\u201d  Israeli media have reported that the controversial deals include properties in East and West Jerusalem, as well as in the port cities of Caesarea and Jaffa. They identified some Jewish and Israeli investors as potential buyers.  Church officials have said they need to sell land in order to pay back debt that has accumulated over the years. Until now the church has been leasing out the land to residents on long-term contracts.  Some Israeli lawmakers are trying to block the deals that they fear could lead to large increases in real estate prices. Palestinians oppose the sale of land to Jewish and Israeli groups and consider it an act of treason.  The demonstrators were Christians from Bethlehem, Nazareth and other cities inside Israel.

Despite battling a virus and with rain falling on the course, the 22-year-old American completed the two runs in an aggregate time of one minute 47.40 seconds, 0.31 seconds ahead of her nearest rival Tessa Worley of France.     Italian Sofia Goggia was third.

This season she has won three slalom races, two giant slaloms, one parallel slalom, the Oslo city event and a downhill.      It was her third World Cup win in a row in all disciplines and her sixth in the last seven races, her form peaking with the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang just one month away.

Michael Wolff told BBC radio that his conclusion in \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d\u2014  that Trump is not fit to do the job \u2014 was becoming a widespread view.   \u201cI think one of the interesting effects of the book so far is a very clear emperor-has-no-clothes effect,\u201d Wolff said in an interview broadcast on Saturday.  \u201cThe story that I have told seems to present this presidency in such a way that it says he can\u2019t do his job,\u201d Wolff said.   \u201cSuddenly everywhere people are going \u2018oh my God, it\u2019s true, he has no clothes\u2019.

It depicts a chaotic White House, a president who was ill-prepared to win the office in 2016, and Trump aides who scorned his abilities.  Trump took to Twitter late on Friday to renew his attacks on Wolff, and on his former top aide Steve Bannon who was quoted in the book.  \u201cMichael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!\u201d  Bannon, formerly Trump\u2019s chief strategist, is chairman of the so-called alt-right Breitbart News website  In his interview with the BBC, Wolff was asked if he believed that Bannon felt Trump was unfit to serve as president and would try to bring him down. \u201cYes,\u201d Wolff replied.  He also hit back at claims that the book was untruthful.  \u201cThis is what\u2019s called reporting. This is how you do it.\u201d he said. \u201cYou ask people, you get as close as you can to the event, you interview the people who were privy to the event, you interview other people who were privy to the event, you come to know the circumstance as well as anybody and then you report it.\u201d     Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Writing by William Schomberg; Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"

          "title": "Lillehammer legacy looms large in Norwegian winter sports",
          "body": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A golden generation of Norwegian athletes born in the wake of the hugely successful Lillehammer Games in 1994 head to Pyeongchang hoping to maintain their position as the most successful nation in Winter Olympic history.   Despite being the smallest country by population ever to host a Winter Games, the Norwegians have won 329 Olympic medals and 20 years after Lillehammer they topped the medals table in Sochi with 11 golds and 26 in total.  Such was the effect of those 1994 Games that in 2017 an Olympic Legacy Sports Centre was opened in Lillehammer with support from the International Olympic Committee.  An international center for winter sports, it will also welcome athletes from countries that lack the \u2018conditions, resources and expertise\u2019 Norway enjoys.   Four-times Olympic champion skier Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who picked up two silver medals in the downhill and combined events at Lillehammer, is well aware of the effect the Games had on the nation\u2019s youth.  \u201cOn the first day of the downhill, Axel Lund Svindal was one of the 60,000 people who came to watch, and I believe that is what the Olympics is all about - inspiring kids, youth or even older people to follow their dream,\u201d Aamodt told Reuters.   Now 35, Svindal went on to win three medals, including gold in the Super G, in Vancouver in 2010 and heads to Pyeongchang as one of Norway\u2019s hottest medal prospects.   For Espen Bredesen, who won one gold and one silver medal for ski jumping at Lillehammer, it is no surprise that the 1994 Games made winter sports more popular than ever in Norway.   \u201cWe won a lot, we had heroes captured in fantastic TV pictures, skiing, cross-country, jumping - our heroes appeared in these wonderful pictures and young people copied them,\u201d Bredesen told Reuters.  \u201cIn that way, it was a tremendous advertisement for winter sports that has gone on for years and years.\u201d  Norway set a record in 1994 by winning 10 gold medals on home soil, and even if it was subsequently broken by Canada in Vancouver, Bredesen and the Norwegians remain proud of their dominant performances and the Games they hosted.   \u201cIt was a wonderful Olympics in terms of the weather and the public. It was fantastic arena, the tracks were perfect, the winter was perfect, the weather was perfect,\u201d Bredesen explained.   \u201cThere was an enormous interest from the general public, from the media - everyone I knew was incredibly interested.\u201d  For Bredesen, nothing could beat competing on home soil.   \u201cThat was the time before mobile phones had arrived, and people took pictures with ordinary cameras, so everything you saw from Lillehammer, you were either there or you saw it on TV,\u201d he recalled.    \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a hundred channels to choose from either, there wasn\u2019t huge amount of sports to choose from - it was the Winter Olympics, and that was it. Everyone got to see it.\u201d  One of those subsequently inspired by Espen Bredesen was ski jumper Daniel Andre Tande, who was born in Narvik in northern Norway just a couple of weeks before the Lillehammer games began.  \u201cOf course Lillehammer is something people still talk about. The Olympics is an extremely special competition, since it\u2019s only every fourth year,\u201d Tande told Reuters.   The 23-year-old said that he and his team mates are often stopped in the street in Norway during the season, and after a strong start to the season he is hoping to represent Norway in Pyeongchang.  \u201cWe always have a goal for the team, for the entire country of Norway, to get as many medals as possible and to be on the top of the medal statistics,\u201d Tande added.  For Bredesen, who works for a waste management company and was part of state broadcaster NRK\u2019s team until 2014, ski jumping remains his first love, but the Norwegian population as a whole will be focusing on other events.   \u201cCross-county is popular, and biathlon is something the Norwegian Olympic Committee is investing in, so it\u2019s very popular,\u201d he said, adding that the time difference to Pyeongchang is unlikely to reduce the nation\u2019s feverish interest.   \u201cIt\u2019s great, because all you have to do is pick up your phone and you get the live broadcasts.\u201d  Reporting by Philip O'Connor; editing by Sudipto Ganguly"

The event was held at the Miyanmori ski jumping stadium on the eastern slope of Mount Okura, where the sport is said to have been first practised in Japan.   Students at the local university, who had seen it in Europe in the early 1900s and brought it back to Japan with them, built jumps around Sapporo to practise on.    The jump used for the Olympics was originally built in the early 1930s with support from Prince Chichibu, a brother of Emperor Hirohito.  By the time Sapporo hosted the 1972 Games, Japan had only won one medal (a silver at the 1956 Games in Turin) at a Winter Olympics, and the country was hungry for success.  \u201cKasaya had the entire nation\u2019s hopes on his shoulders, and he\u2019d been winning recent competitions, so expectations were high,\u201d Chiba said.   Kasaya took gold in front of a packed crowd at the Miyanomori site, Akitsugu Konno took silver and Seiji Aochi took bronze in a clean sweep.  The 1-2-3 finish ended up being the only medals the host nation won in Sapporo and the trio became the toast of the nation, creating a yardstick that generations of ski jumpers that followed have had a hard time measuring up to, despite a team silver in 1994 and gold at the 1998 event in Nagano.    The 77-year-old Chiba said it\u2019s hard to specify why Japan has enjoyed such relative success in ski jumping compared to other winter sports.  \u201cI\u2019ve been asked that a lot, and it\u2019s hard to answer. I think it might be because Japanese are detail-oriented,\u201d he explained.   \u201cRunning needs sheer physical strength. The cross-country coaches say that, that no matter how hard our athletes try, it\u2019s hard to compete (against physically bigger foreigners).  \u201cJumping is more technical, and not so much physical strength.\u201d  Despite its population of around 3,500, the small town of Shimokawa, some 220km from Sapporo, has provided more than its fair share of Olympic ski jumpers to the national team.  Noriaki Kasai is set to compete in his eighth Olympic Games at the age of 45, while 23-year-old Yuki Ito is at the other end of the scale, expected to make her Olympic debut in Pyeongchang.   \u201cTo nurture athletes in this sport, it\u2019s very important that they be near ski jumps. You have to have snow, you have to have people living near snow, and you have to have the facilities to jump,\u201d Katsuhiko Ito, father of Yuki and a member of the board of education in Shimokawa, told Reuters.  \u201cWe have four jumps in our town. Some of them are just a 15-20 minute walk for elementary school students. It\u2019s a sport that requires a major facility, so you need to have that nearby.\u201d  With the Winter Games taking place in Asia for the first time in 20 years, the stage is set for the Japanese to shine once again in the sport of ski jumping.

          "title": "Germany, Turkey pledge to thaw ties that coup crackdown and arrests froze",
          "body": "GOSLAR, Germany (Reuters) - Germany and Turkey\u2019s foreign ministers on Saturday agreed to pull out all the stops to improve ties that have soured due to disputes over Ankara\u2019s post-coup crackdown and the arrests of German citizens in Turkey, but they stressed differences remain.  Meeting in an ornate imperial palace in central Germany, the pair said they were keen to make amends after falling out as Ankara rounded up suspected supporters of a failed 2016 coup, a comedian mocked Turkey\u2019s president and a German-Turkish journalist was detained without charge.  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel pointed to historic links between the countries including the role Turkish guest workers played in rebuilding Germany after World War Two, Turkey\u2019s hospitality in taking in German refugees during the Nazi era and the 3 million-strong Turkish community here.  \u201cWe\u2019ve both made it our business to do everything we can to overcome the difficulties there have been in German-Turkish relations and to find more common ground in the future by remembering everything that binds us together,\u201d Gabriel said.  German politicians have been outspoken critics of Turkey\u2019s post-coup crackdown, in which some 50,000 people have been arrested pending trial and 150,000, including teachers, judges and soldiers, have been sacked or suspended from their jobs.  Turkey says the crackdown, targeting alleged supporters of a Muslim network it blames for the coup, is necessary on security grounds. Ankara has criticized Germany\u2019s refusal to hand over asylum seekers it says were involved in the failed putsch.   Adding to the tension, the German government believes seven Germans, of whom four have dual citizenship, are being held in prison in Turkey for political reasons.  But in a sign of recovering relations, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the NATO allies believed they could overcome recent escalations in tension through dialogue.   Cavusoglu said Turkey and Germany shared similar views on conflict-hit Middle East countries and they were cooperating on humanitarian issues like migration.  During a working lunch on Saturday, he and Gabriel would discuss steps they can take together in future, Cavusoglu said.  But the pair acknowledged areas of disagreement. Cavusoglu said one bone of contention was whether Turkey should be allowed to join the European Union - a move that Germany opposes - but he sounded a conciliatory note.  \u201cThere is benefit in pushing our disagreements aside and continuing on our path. We should focus on issues that serve as win-win for our countries, like the Customs Union,\u201d he said.  One of the disputes between Berlin and Ankara centers around the arrest of Deniz Yucel, a reporter for German newspaper Die Welt. Turkish authorities accuse him of spreading propaganda for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). He denies the charge.  Gabriel said he had discussed thorny issues including Yucel\u2019s case with Cavusoglu but did not give details.  Germany is Turkey\u2019s biggest trade partner but exports from Europe\u2019s largest economy to Turkey dropped by 5.9 percent year-on-year in the first nine months of 2017.  Gabriel told magazine Der Spiegel on Friday Germany had refused to authorize \u201ca large number of arms exports\u201d to Turkey and that would remain the case until Yucel\u2019s case was resolved.  But on Saturday he said the German government would consider whether to deliver mine protection gear for armored vehicles in Turkey, an issue not linked to arrests, he said.

          "body": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Norway\u2019s cross-country skiers will arrive in Pyeongchang hoping to continue their recent dominance in a sport that doubles as a national obsession, but even at home there are questions over the ethical use of medicines by athletes.   Norway won 18 medals in total, including gold at all five of the women\u2019s cross-country events, at the 2017 World Championships in Lahti, Finland, seven more than nearest rivals Germany.   But thanks to the fallout around recent doping bans for Martin Johnsrud Sundby and Therese Johaug, there were almost as many headlines about alleged doping in the Scandinavian country.    Johnsrud Sundby\u2019s 2016 ban for over-use of an asthma medicine, which were alleged to have been given to athletes without a medical diagnosis or as a preventative measure, prompted the Norwegian Ski Federation to open an investigation into their use.    The 191-page report found no evidence of wrongdoing in the Norwegian team, but it did concede the use of asthma medicines to treat temporary symptoms represented an ethical dilemma.   The report was also critical of the availability of the medication, which it said was freely available in the trailer used for waxing the skis of the competitors.  \u201cIt is common practice in Norway to occasionally use asthma medicine in major ailments in the respiratory system ... even where the diagnosis of asthma is not specific,\u201d Per Medboe Thorsby, head of the medical committee for Anti-Doping Norway, told Reuters.   \u201cThere is little evidence that this can prevent the development of asthma in the long run. Anti-Doping Norway does not presume that such medicines should be used systematically to prevent asthma.\u201d  The use of Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) and asthma medicines in endurance sports is a controversial topic, with no TUE necessary for certain medication up to specific limits.   In December 2017 it was revealed that cyclist and four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome had excessive levels of salbutamol, the same substance Johnsrud Sundby had over-used, in his urine after a stage of the 2017 Vuelta a Espana.   Norway\u2019s neighbours and bitter rivals Sweden take a different approach to medication, which has led to a tense relationship between the two countries.   \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on how Norway medicate, but what we focus on is having a clear diagnosis when we give medicine,\u201d Sweden team doctor Per Andersson told Reuters.   \u201cAnd naturally one shouldn\u2019t medicate healthy skiers that don\u2019t need medicine. That is a fundamental principle that is important to uphold,\u201d he added.   Johaug, a three-time Olympic medalist, was a notable omission from Norway\u2019s team in the wake of a positive test in September, 2016 for the steroid clostebol.  The 29-year-old said the result was caused by an ointment called Trofodermin which she used to treat sunburnt lips during a training camp in Italy without knowing it contained a banned substance.  The Norwegian Olympic Committee banned Johaug for 13 months, effectively allowing her to compete at Pyeongchang, but the world governing body FIS appealed to the Court of Arbitration in Sport (CAS), which extended the ban past the Games.  Barring a new directive from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), it is unlikely that Norway\u2019s attitude to asthma medication will change before next month\u2019s Games.   \u201cIf one uses asthma medicines in the doses recommended for this illness and within the terms of the WADA doping list, we do not believe that there are any special benefits as a result of such use,\u201d Anti-Doping Norway\u2019s Thorsby said.  \u201cOn the contrary, we believe that practitioners with documented asthma who do not get proper treatment will be at a major disadvantage.\u201d   Editing by Greg Stutchbury"

          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - With a total of 11 medals, including three golds, ski jumping has provided rich pickings at the Winter Olympics for Japan, and the Games in Pyeongchang will provide another chance for them to excel in front of a prime-time Asian audience.    The combination of strength, timing and technique makes it a sport that has long appealed to the Japanese, with the epicenter of ski jumping excellence located on the north island of Hokkaido.   It was there that the gold-silver-bronze triumph, led by Yukio Kasaya, at the 1972 Olympics on home turf in Sapporo took place, cementing the status of the sport there.   \u201cI was starter at the top of the jump, next to all the jumpers.

          "title": "Lillehammer legacy looms large in Norwegian winter sports",
          "body": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A golden generation of Norwegian athletes born in the wake of the hugely successful Lillehammer Games in 1994 head to Pyeongchang hoping to maintain their position as the most successful nation in Winter Olympic history.   Despite being the smallest country by population ever to host a Winter Games, the Norwegians have won 329 Olympic medals and 20 years after Lillehammer they topped the medals table in Sochi with 11 golds and 26 in total.  Such was the effect of those 1994 Games that in 2017 an Olympic Legacy Sports Centre was opened in Lillehammer with support from the International Olympic Committee.  An international center for winter sports, it will also welcome athletes from countries that lack the \u2018conditions, resources and expertise\u2019 Norway enjoys.   Four-times Olympic champion skier Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who picked up two silver medals in the downhill and combined events at Lillehammer, is well aware of the effect the Games had on the nation\u2019s youth.  \u201cOn the first day of the downhill, Axel Lund Svindal was one of the 60,000 people who came to watch, and I believe that is what the Olympics is all about - inspiring kids, youth or even older people to follow their dream,\u201d Aamodt told Reuters.   Now 35, Svindal went on to win three medals, including gold in the Super G, in Vancouver in 2010 and heads to Pyeongchang as one of Norway\u2019s hottest medal prospects.   For Espen Bredesen, who won one gold and one silver medal for ski jumping at Lillehammer, it is no surprise that the 1994 Games made winter sports more popular than ever in Norway.   \u201cWe won a lot, we had heroes captured in fantastic TV pictures, skiing, cross-country, jumping - our heroes appeared in these wonderful pictures and young people copied them,\u201d Bredesen told Reuters.  \u201cIn that way, it was a tremendous advertisement for winter sports that has gone on for years and years.\u201d  Norway set a record in 1994 by winning 10 gold medals on home soil, and even if it was subsequently broken by Canada in Vancouver, Bredesen and the Norwegians remain proud of their dominant performances and the Games they hosted.   \u201cIt was a wonderful Olympics in terms of the weather and the public. It was fantastic arena, the tracks were perfect, the winter was perfect, the weather was perfect,\u201d Bredesen explained.   \u201cThere was an enormous interest from the general public, from the media - everyone I knew was incredibly interested.\u201d  For Bredesen, nothing could beat competing on home soil.   \u201cThat was the time before mobile phones had arrived, and people took pictures with ordinary cameras, so everything you saw from Lillehammer, you were either there or you saw it on TV,\u201d he recalled.    \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a hundred channels to choose from either, there wasn\u2019t huge amount of sports to choose from - it was the Winter Olympics, and that was it. Everyone got to see it.\u201d  One of those subsequently inspired by Espen Bredesen was ski jumper Daniel Andre Tande, who was born in Narvik in northern Norway just a couple of weeks before the Lillehammer games began.  \u201cOf course Lillehammer is something people still talk about. The Olympics is an extremely special competition, since it\u2019s only every fourth year,\u201d Tande told Reuters.   The 23-year-old said that he and his team mates are often stopped in the street in Norway during the season, and after a strong start to the season he is hoping to represent Norway in Pyeongchang.  \u201cWe always have a goal for the team, for the entire country of Norway, to get as many medals as possible and to be on the top of the medal statistics,\u201d Tande added.  For Bredesen, who works for a waste management company and was part of state broadcaster NRK\u2019s team until 2014, ski jumping remains his first love, but the Norwegian population as a whole will be focusing on other events.   \u201cCross-county is popular, and biathlon is something the Norwegian Olympic Committee is investing in, so it\u2019s very popular,\u201d he said, adding that the time difference to Pyeongchang is unlikely to reduce the nation\u2019s feverish interest.   \u201cIt\u2019s great, because all you have to do is pick up your phone and you get the live broadcasts.\u201d  Reporting by Philip O'Connor; editing by Sudipto Ganguly"

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Thousands of government supporters staged rallies in Iran for a fourth day on Saturday in a backlash against widespread anti-government protests that the clerical establishment has blamed on the country\u2019s enemies.   Saturday\u2019s show of support took place a day after Iran\u2019s foreign minister said a United Nations Security Council meeting called by the United States to discuss the protests had proved a \u201cblunder\u201d by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.  State television showed rallies and marches in more than a dozen cities with demonstrators waving Iranian flags and chanting slogans including \u201cDeath to America\u201d, \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d and \u201cDeath to Britain\u201d.  More than a week of unrest has seen 22 people die and more than 1,000 arrested, according to Iranian officials, in the biggest anti-government protests for nearly a decade.   Unrest spread to more than 80 cities and rural towns as thousands of young and working-class Iranians voiced anger at graft, unemployment and a deepening gap between rich and poor.   Residents contacted by Reuters in various cities have said the protests had subsided in recent days, after the government intensified a crackdown by dispatching Revolutionary Guards forces to several provinces.  On Saturday, videos on social media showed a heavy police presence in cities, including Khorramabad in southwestern Iran where on Wednesday evening social media posts showed protesters throwing stones at riot police.  The protests have drawn largely young people and workers as well as members of the educated middle-class that formed the backbone of a pro-reform revolt almost a decade ago.   The provincial governor in northeastern Mashhad, where the protests started, was quoted as saying on Saturday that 85 percent of detainees there had been released after signing a pledge not to re-offend.  \u201cThose with a criminal record, or those charged with sabotage such as setting fire to motorcycles or damaging public buildings have been referred to judicial authorities,\u201d governor Alireza Rashidian told the ISNA news agency.  A police spokesman said most of those arrested were \u201cduped\u201d into joining the unrest and had been freed on bail, the state news agency IRNA reported. \u201cBut, the leaders of the unrest are held by the judiciary in prison.\u201d   Tehran University Vice-President Majid Sarsangi said the university had set up a committee to track the fate of students arrested during the unrest.  \u201cOur efforts at the university are aimed at cooperating with the relevant authorities to create the conditions for the return  of the detained students to the university and their families in the shortest possible time,\u201d Sarsangi told ISNA.  Separately, a member of parliament said about 90 students were detained, 10 of whom were still not accounted for.  \u201cIt seems that the total number of detainees is around 90. Ten students from universities in Tehran and some other cities are in an uncertain position, and ... it is still unknown which body has detained them,\u201d the labor news agency ILNA quoted reformist politician Mahmoud Sadeghi as saying.  Iran has several parallel security bodies and residents say arrests are often not immediately announced.  Videos that appeared on social media in recent days showed relatives of detainees gathering outside prisons seeking information about the fate of their loved ones.  In Europe, hundreds of Iranians held rallies on Saturday in support of the anti-government protests in Iran, in cities including Stockholm, London, Paris and Berlin.  About 400 people gathered in central Paris, and several hundred held a rally in front of Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate with Iranian flags, drums and banners calling for a change of government.    One of the protesters in Berlin, 18-year-old Pariya Kohandel Saleh, said her father was in jail in Iran for supporting the families of prisoners.  \u201cThings should be good in Iran now the sanctions have been lifted, but the mullahs\u2019 pockets are bottomless and everybody knows it,\u201d she told Reuters.  A United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday to discuss the protests turned into criticism of the United States for requesting to meet on what some member states said was an internal issue for Iran.  Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted: \u201cThe UNSC rebuffed the U.S.\u2019s naked attempt to hijack its mandate ... Another FP (foreign policy) blunder for the Trump administration.\u201d   Iran\u2019s elite Guards and its affiliated Basij militia suppressed unrest in 2009 over alleged election fraud, in which dozens of pro-reform Iranians were killed.

Mugabe, 93, stood down in November after 37 years in power following a de facto military coup, making way for his former deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa to take over.  When the military seized power they arrested key allies of Mugabe and his wife, Grace, who was vying with Mnangagwa to succeed her husband.  Former foreign minister Walter Mzembi and ex-energy minister Samuel Undenge were charged on Friday with \u201ccriminal abuse of office\u201d, their lawyers said. They both deny wrongdoing.  Undenge is accused of issuing a $12,650 contract without due tender to a company that did no work, according to a charge sheet seen by Reuters.   Mzembi and Undenge were both granted bail on Saturday, asked to surrender their passports and remanded until Jan. 22 when their cases will be heard.  \u201cWe are going to make an application for an exception to the charge because the charges that my client is facing are ridiculous,\u201d Job Sikhala, Mzembi\u2019s lawyer, told reporters outside the court.  Undenge\u2019s lawyer Alex Muchadehama described the case against his client as a \u201ccircus\u201d.

          "body": "(Repeats Friday\u2019s story with no changes to text)  By Daniel Trotta and Jonathan Allen  NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Gun violence in major U.S. cities fell in 2017 as police used the latest crime-fighting software combined with a revival of old-fashioned community policing to build trust with a skeptical public.  Law enforcement officials and criminologists credit that dual approach with helping extend the decades-long reduction in crime in New York City and reducing gun violence in Chicago by 20 percent in 2017.  Crime has dropped precipitously across the United States since peaking in 1991, though some cities have lagged and others have experienced sudden spikes.  Chicago became a symbol of U.S. gun violence after homicides soared nearly 60 percent in 2016, drawing frequent criticism from Donald Trump during his campaign for the presidency and after he was elected.  Since then, the third-largest U.S. city has revamped policing policies and developed a sophisticated integration of crime-fighting software and hardware such as cameras. It has also built ties to the public through events such as a Halloween party that drew 500 kids to a police station in a high-crime district.  While there is no hard evidence that those initiatives were responsible, homicides in Chicago dropped 16 percent in 2017 to 650. That still outnumbered homicides in the two largest U.S. cities, New York and Los Angeles, combined.  \u201cThere was a promise to never relive 2016,\u201d said Anthony Guglielmi, chief communications officer for Chicago police. \u201cThat was a moment in time we never want to repeat in terms of violence.\u201d  While Chicago has seen volatile swings, New York has experienced a consistent reduction in crime, in sharp contrast with a bygone reputation as the country\u2019s murder and mayhem capital.  On Friday the New York Police Department reported 290 murders in 2017, down 13 percent from 2016 and 87 percent from 1990, when a record 2,262 people were killed.  The New York Police Department called 2017 the safest year in nearly seven decades even as arrests decreased by nearly 400 per day from their high point seven years ago.  Experts do not entirely understand the trend but point to a number of likely factors, including CompStat, the computer analysis of crime data that was developed by New York police in 1994 and has since been replicated in other cities.  CompStat gives police daily reports on how they are performing, enabling them to quickly identify trends and deploy officers to trouble spots.  Data-driven, evidence-based policing has advanced further with the help of crime-predicting software like HunchLab and gunfire-detection system ShotSpotter.  Technology \u201chelps us to link cases quicker, deploy faster and deploy smarter,\u201d Dermot Shea, the NYPD\u2019s chief of crime control strategies, told a news conference on Friday.  The public uproar over police shootings of unarmed black men across the United States in recent years has also convinced police they must adopt neighborhood or community policing.  That aims to improve relationships between police and residents of high-crime districts and reduce animosity toward police to gain more co-operation in solving and preventing crimes.  \u201cTechnology is great ... but I think the best thing going for us is the ability for the police officers to establish and have relationships with the people in this great city,\u201d New York Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said.  Chicago studied the best practices of the New York and Los Angeles police departments, incorporating much of New York\u2019s neighborhood policing model and the use of predictive crime software by Los Angeles.  In February, Chicago rolled out so-called Strategic Decision Support Centers, which integrate gunfire detection and predictive crime software with the city\u2019s extensive network of cameras. Before year\u2019s end the centers had expanded to six of the city\u2019s 22 districts.  The program started in notoriously high crime districts such as Englewood and Harrison, where police said crime fell by 43 percent and 26 percent, respectively, in 2017.  Now, when a trigger is pulled, Chicago police are alerted within 30 seconds by ShotSpotter, and the information is relayed to the smartphones of patrol officers within a minute, Guglielmi said.  Meanwhile, with cameras switched on in the gunshot\u2019s vicinity, the same data is run through the HunchLab system. Police and criminologists from the University of Chicago analyze the data in real time, dispatching updates to patrol officers, Guglielmi said.  Chicago police are now frequently responding to incidents as much as three minutes before witnesses report gunfire to the 911 emergency number, he said.  The Chicago experience appears to be \u201ca promising step forward,\u201d said Max Kapustin of the University of Chicago\u2019s Crime Lab.  \u201cCertainly in the case of Chicago and specifically in the district of Englewood, there\u2019s a lot of suggestive evidence that this led to those reductions and seems like a really meaningful way forward for reducing crime,\u201d Kapustin said.

From northern Florida up through New York City into New England, tens of millions of people will be under wind chill and freeze warnings throughout the day as temperatures in some parts to the north were expected to be -40 F (-40 C), while in parts of the south highs were forecast to be 20 degrees below average.  \u201cIt can be very dangerous,\u201d said Dan Pydynowski, a meteorologist with private forecasting service AccuWeather. \u201cAny kind of exposed skin can freeze in a couple of minutes.\u201d  The cold snap comes as workers clear snow and ice from roadways after a blizzard clobbered the region on Thursday and Friday, forcing hundreds of schools to close, major airports to shut down because of whiteout conditions and several commuter rail services to suspend or reduce service.  The region\u2019s first snow storm of 2018 featured gusts of more than 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour), dumping 22 inches (56 cms) of snow in parts of Maine and 17 inches (43 cm) in parts of Massachusetts, before ending on Friday, the National Weather Service said.  The storm was powered by a rapid drop in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d  The cold and snowy weather have been blamed for at least 18 deaths in the past few days, including four in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas.  Cities from Houston to Boston have stepped up efforts to bring the homeless to shelters. Authorities said three homeless people in Texas died from exposure to the cold.  Canada\u2019s largest city, Toronto, scrambled to find emergency shelter for the homeless as temperatures dropped to record lows after the sweeping storm knocked out power to tens of thousands in eastern provinces and destroyed coastal roads.

Value stocks, so labeled because they typically sport lower price-to-earnings valuations, tend to be in more staid or out-of-favor industries and often lag during outsized stock rallies, which is exactly what happened in 2017.   The S&P 500 Value index .IVX - a measure of companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) - gained just 12.6 percent last year. That is a tortoise\u2019s pace measured against the far more hare-like S&P 500 Growth index .IGX, which doubled that performance. It clocked a 25.4-percent rise courtesy of its heavy contingent of tech giants like Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).  As a result, even some growth funds are moving out of high-flying technology stocks and increasing their positions in  stocks they see as more reasonably valued at a time when the American Association of Individual Investors survey shows the greatest exuberance for stocks since November 2014.   \u201cThere is some risk to the technology sector after the big run we\u2019ve had. Where we see opportunities now are sectors that have attractive valuations and higher visibility into their revenue streams,\u201d said Matthew Litfin, a co-portfolio manager of the $4.7-billion Columbia Acorn fund (ACRNX.O).  Litfin is now underweight technology and has been adding to its holdings of financial stocks, such as asset management Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N), which trades at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 15.1 versus 23.7 for the S&P 500 .SPX as a whole. Lazard shares are up 5.8 percent so far in 2018.  Thyra Zerhusen, a co-portfolio manager of the $4.2 billion Fairepoint Capital Mid Cap fund (CHTTX.O), said she has been moving into the likes of toymaker Mattel Inc (MAT.O) and General Electric Co (GE.N), whose corporate upheavals overshadow the value of their underlying assets.   GE, for instance, trades at a trailing P/E of 21.2, and its shares are down 41.7 percent over the last year as new chief executive John Flannery has announced plans to shrink the company and exit some of its sprawling business lines. Shares of Mattel, meanwhile, slid 46 percent over the last 12 months as it suspended its dividend and cited the bankruptcy of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, the biggest U.S. toy retailer, as a factor in its weak sales.   \u201cLast year was not a good environment for value, but now is a time when you can find investments that will go up substantially over the next two years,\u201d she said.  So far so good: Mattel is up 4.3 percent since the new year rang in, and GE is up 6.1 percent. The S&P is up about 2.3 percent.   A good year for growth stocks does not necessarily mean that value stocks will bounce back the following year, of course.   In the 20 previous occasions that the S&P 500 jumped by more than 18 percent in one year since 1951, the index rose by an additional 10 percent or more the following year 10 times, according to Credit Suisse, with growth stocks leading the way. The other 10 times the S&P on average declined 1.7 percent the next year.  Over the first three trading days of 2018, the iShares S&P 500 Growth index ETF (IVW.P) is up 2.9 percent, while the iShares S&P 500 Value index ETF (IVE.P) is up 1.6 percent.   Yet Matthew Watson, a portfolio manager at James Advantage funds, said that his firm has been bracing for a significant correction in the so-called FAANG group of large tech stocks, such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) that jumped by 30 percent or more in 2017 and pulled the broad index higher.   Instead, the firm has been adding to positions in out-of-favor energy stocks such as Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc (DO.N) and retailers such as Macy\u2019s Inc (M.N) that have under-appreciated assets, he said.   Macy\u2019s, for instance, is trading barely above the value of its underlying real estate portfolio, Watson said, while Diamond Offshore trades at 70 percent of its book value, a measure of the value of the assets on a company\u2019s balance sheet. Macy\u2019s is down 3.3 percent in the first week of 2018, while Diamond Offshore is up 2.1 percent.  \u201cThere may be positive momentum in the stock market right now, but that is only going to make it more expensive,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe think that the only choice you have now to find opportunities that will pay off in the long-run is to look for value.\u201d   (The story was refiled to corrects \u2018fund\u2019 to \u2018funds\u2019 in paragraph 4)  Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Dan Burns and Nick Zieminski"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Australia\u2019s Nick Kyrgios battled past defending champion Grigor Dimitrov 3-6 6-1 6-4 to set up a final against American Ryan Harrison at the Brisbane International on Saturday.  After losing the first set, the number three seed stamped his authority on the second, converting two break points to force a decider for a third consecutive match this week.  \u201cI knew that I had to do something a little bit differently today. I couldn\u2019t give him too much rhythm,\u201d Kyrgios said after the match.  The 22-year-old Kyrgios was dominant on serve, hitting 19 aces and winning 82 percent of his first-serve points, and broke Dimitrov in the seventh game of the final set to claim his first victory over the Bulgarian in three meetings.  World number 21 Kyrgios could clinch his first ATP Tour title on home soil on Sunday and make a huge statement ahead of the Australian Open, which begins at Melbourne Park on Jan. 15.  In the other semi-final, Harrison came back from a set down to end the dream run of Australian wildcard Alex De Minaur in a 4-6 7-6(5) 6-4 victory.  The 18-year-old De Minaur raced past Harrison to claim the first set before forcing a tiebreak in the second, where he cruised to a 5-3 lead.  Standing just two points away from his first career final, De Minaur committed a string of errors, including a double fault to concede a set point to Harrison, allowing the world number 47 back into the match.  De Minaur started flat in the decider and Harrison pounced on the opportunity, breaking his opponent\u2019s serve twice to lead 5-1.  Harrison was broken while trying to serve out the match at 5-2 but recovered and held to love to reach only his third ATP Tour final, all of which have come since February last year.  Heading into the final, Kyrgios has a 2-0 head-to-head advantage with Harrison yet to take a set off the Australian.  \u201cI know that he\u2019s a dangerous opponent. He can serve very, very well and he\u2019s obviously won a lot of matches here,\u201d Kyrgios said.  Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is examining ways to mitigate any Pakistani retaliation as it piles pressure on Islamabad to crack down on militants, a senior U.S. official said on Friday, cautioning that U.S. action could extend beyond a new freeze in aid.  Pakistan is a crucial gateway for U.S. military supplies destined for U.S. and other troops fighting a 16-year-old war in neighboring, landlocked Afghanistan.   So far, the Pentagon says Pakistan has not given any indication that it would close its airspace or roads to military supplies and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis played down concerns on Friday.    But Washington has only just begun to work through its new plan to suspend up to roughly $2 billion in U.S. security assistance, announced on Thursday. It came days after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that Pakistan had rewarded past U.S. aid with \u201cnothing but lies & deceit.\u201d   The senior Trump administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Washington hoped that the aid suspension would be enough to communicate its concern to Islamabad.  But the official cautioned that the freeze was also not the only tool that America had to pressure the country \u2014 suggesting it might resort to other measures, if needed.  \u201cWe are considering many different things, not just the (financial) assistance issue,\u201d the official said.  \u201cWe are also looking at Pakistan\u2019s potential response ... and we are looking at ways to deal with that and to mitigate the risks to the relationship.\u201d  The official declined to detail what steps were under consideration, including whether that might include possible unilateral U.S. military action against militants in Pakistan.  But as Trump allow the U.S. military to again ramp up its war effort in Afghanistan, including with the deployment of more U.S. troops alongside Afghan forces, the official acknowledged a sense of urgency.  The United States has long blamed the militant safehavens in Pakistan for prolonging the war in Afghanistan, giving insurgents, including from the Haqqani network, a place to plot attacks and rebuild its forces.   \u201cWe believe we owe it to the Americans in harms\u2019 way in Afghanistan. We simply can\u2019t ignore the sanctuaries if we are going to make progress in Afghanistan,\u201d the official said.   Mattis, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, said he was not concerned about America\u2019s ability to use Pakistan as a gateway to resupply U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  \u201cI\u2019m not concerned, no,\u201d Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon, adding he had not gotten any indication from Pakistan that it might cut off those routes. Mattis traveled to Pakistan last month.  \u201cWe\u2019re still working with Pakistan and we would restore the aid if we see decisive movements against the terrorists \u2014 who are as much a threat against Pakistan as they are to us.\u201d  The United States has also said some of the frozen aid could be released on a case-by-case basis, and none of it will be spent elsewhere \u2014 leaving the door open to full reconciliation.  The Pakistani reaction has so far been limited to harsh rhetoric, with Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif saying the United States was behaving toward Pakistan as \u201ca friend who always betrays.\u201d  But opposition leader Imran Khan, a former cricket star tipped as the next Pakistani prime minister, said it was time for Pakistan to \u201cdelink\u201d from the United States.  The senior Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged that a Pakistani cut-off  would greatly complicate U.S. resupply efforts in Afghanistan.   The official said the administration was developing \u201crisk mitigation plans,\u201d but acknowledged that examination of a northern network of alternative routes used in the past was \u201cstill at a very broad level.\u201d  \u201cIf something were to happen to the ground lines of communication or air lines of communication through Pakistan, certainly that would be very difficult for the U.S. and we would have to look for alternatives,\u201d the official said.  \u201cAnd it would not be easy.\u201d  Reporting by Phil Stewart; Additional reporting by Steve Holland, Jonathan Landay and Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Lisa Shumaker"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has frozen $125 million in funding for a U.N. agency that provides aid to Palestinian refugees, Axios news site reported on Friday, but a State Department official said no decision had been made on the payment.  Days after President Donald Trump threatened to withhold future aid payments to Palestinians, Axios said the funding was frozen until the U.S. government finishes its review of aid to the Palestinian Authority.  The sum, a third of the annual U.S. donation to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, was supposed to be delivered by Jan. 1, Axios said, citing three unidentified Western diplomats.  The State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cThat (Axios) story is very misleading. Just because they were expecting the money on the first, and they did not get it at that time, does not mean it was suspended or canceled. Deliberations are ongoing, and we have until mid-January to make a final decision.\u201d  Asked if any preliminary decision had been made, the official replied: \u201cNo. And reports to that effect are false.\u201d  UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said the agency had not been \u201cinformed directly of a formal decision either way by the U.S. administration.\u201d  Trump said on Tuesday he would withhold money from the Palestinians, accusing them of being \u201cno longer willing to talk peace\u201d with Israel.  \u201cWe pay HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don\u2019t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?\u201d Trump said on Twitter.  The United States is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA\u2019s website.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Bushfires in Australia destroyed buildings and threatened lives on Saturday as a heatwave in three states brought temperatures strong enough to melt the bitumen on a highway.   A fire raging out of control set several structures ablaze on the outskirts of Melbourne, the country\u2019s second largest city, and the capital of the southeastern state of Victoria.  The state\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Craig Lapsley, said hot temperatures had combined with dry weather, strong winds and a wind change to create dangerous conditions.  \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what the forecast indicated and when we have fires running that\u2019s obviously a problem for us,\u201d he told a news conference.  About 400 homes lost power and 50 fires were reported across Victoria on Saturday, although many were small and were extinguished.   Emergency warnings were issued both in Victoria and in the nearby state of South Australia, where authorities advised residents of a rural area to seek shelter in buildings from an out-of-control fire.  Experts consider such a move to be safer than running the risk of getting trapped in the open if the fire suddenly changes direction.  Total fire bans took effect from midnight as Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania braced for dangerous fire conditions caused by temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104\u00b0F).  The heat was strong enough to melt the bitumen on a 10-km (6-mile) stretch of freeway in Victoria, national broadcaster ABC News reported.  Australia is prone to deadly blazes, thanks to its combination of remote terrain, high summer temperatures and flammable eucalyptus bush.  In 2009, the worst bushfires on record destroyed thousands of homes in Victoria, killing 173 people and injuring 414 on a day the media dubbed \u201cBlack Saturday\u201d.

          "body": "YANGON (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslim insurgents ambushed a military vehicle in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine State, wounding five members of the security forces, state media and officials said, and the rebels claimed responsibility for the rare attack.  A wave of raids by the insurgents on security force posts on Aug. 25 sparked sweeping army counter-insurgency operations in the Muslim-majority north of the state that led to widespread violence and arson and an exodus of some 650,000 Rohingya villagers to neighbouring Bangladesh.  The United Nations condemned the Myanmar military campaign as ethnic cleansing. Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejected that.  But since Aug. 25, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgents, who claimed responsibility for the coordinated raids on 30 security posts, have mounted only a few sporadic attacks.  The military said \u201cextremist Bengali terrorists ARSA\u201d carried out the Friday attack on a truck taking someone to hospital.  \u201cA vehicle ... was attacked by 20 insurgents from the mountain using homemade mines and small arms,\u201d the government said. The military said there were about 10 attackers.  An ARSA spokesman said his group had carried out the attack.  \u201cYes, ARSA takes responsibility for the latest military movement,\u201d the spokesman told Reuters through a messaging service.  He said further details may be revealed later.  The ARSA dismisses any links to Islamist militant groups and says it is fighting to end the oppression of the Rohingya people.  The Yangon-based Frontier Myanmar magazine quoted a resident of a nearby village as saying sporadic gunfire had been heard at the time of the ambush. A state-run newspaper reported on Saturday that fighting continued after the ambush.  The area is largely off-limits to reporters.  Myanmar and Bangladesh have been discussing a plan to repatriate the Rohingya refugees but more insecurity in Myanmar is likely to raise doubts about how quickly that might take place.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s banking regulator has introduced new measures to increase scrutiny on investments in commercial lenders and tighten regulation on the entrusted loans market, a rapidly growing segment of the country\u2019s shadow banking.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) published regulations on its website late on Friday that put limits on the number of commercial banks that single investors can have major holdings in. The rules are aimed at tackling \u201cdisorder\u201d in the banking sector, including the abuse of rights by major shareholders and the prevalence of \u201cinvisible shareholders\u201d.  And in separate measures announced on Saturday, the CBRC said it would require firms to step up their risk management and disclosure around entrusted loans, a form of business-to-business financing.  Under the new commercial lender shareholding regulations, a single investor can hold 5 percent or more, considered a major shareholding, of no more than two commercial banks, or a controlling stake of no more than one lender.   Any stake purchase of more than 5 percent must be approved by the CBRC and major shareholders of commercial lenders cannot hold interests in the same institution via financial products.  The measures, which follow draft regulations released in November, also require major shareholders to disclose their ownership structures up to the ultimate beneficial holder.  The regulatory moves could have implications for companies such as Anbang Insurance Group, which holds multiple stakes in commercial lenders.  As of Sept. 30, Anbang Insurance Group held a 15.54 percent in China Minsheng Bank 600016 as a result of a direct stake held by Anbang Life and through two separate financial products, company filings show.   The Beijing-based insurer also held a greater than 13 percent interest in China Merchants Bank Co (600036.SS) through its property and casualty insurance unit during the same period.  The CBRC\u2019s new rules regulating entrusted loans, published on its website on Saturday, include strengthening risk management, supervision, and disclosures on the source and intended use of the funds.  Entrusted loans are a form of inter-company financing in which one firm serves as the ultimate lender and records the loan asset on its balance sheet while banks act as intermediaries for a fee.  The entrusted loans market has grown rapidly in recent years and had some positive effects, the CBRC said, but a lack of standardized regulations meant there were \u201ccertain hidden risks\u201d.  In recent months, Chinese regulators have introduced a series of new measures aimed at controlling risk and leverage in the financial system, with everything from lending practices to shadow banking under the microscope.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s banking regulator has introduced new measures to increase scrutiny on investments in commercial lenders and tighten regulation on the entrusted loans market, a rapidly growing segment of the country\u2019s shadow banking.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) published regulations on its website late on Friday that put limits on the number of commercial banks that single investors can have major holdings in. The rules are aimed at tackling \u201cdisorder\u201d in the banking sector, including the abuse of rights by major shareholders and the prevalence of \u201cinvisible shareholders\u201d.  And in separate measures announced on Saturday, the CBRC said it would require firms to step up their risk management and disclosure around entrusted loans, a form of business-to-business financing.  Under the new commercial lender shareholding regulations, a single investor can hold 5 percent or more, considered a major shareholding, of no more than two commercial banks, or a controlling stake of no more than one lender.   Any stake purchase of more than 5 percent must be approved by the CBRC and major shareholders of commercial lenders cannot hold interests in the same institution via financial products.  The measures, which follow draft regulations released in November, also require major shareholders to disclose their ownership structures up to the ultimate beneficial holder.  The regulatory moves could have implications for companies such as Anbang Insurance Group, which holds multiple stakes in commercial lenders.  As of Sept. 30, Anbang Insurance Group held a 15.54 percent in China Minsheng Bank 600016 as a result of a direct stake held by Anbang Life and through two separate financial products, company filings show.   The Beijing-based insurer also held a greater than 13 percent interest in China Merchants Bank Co (600036.SS) through its property and casualty insurance unit during the same period.  The CBRC\u2019s new rules regulating entrusted loans, published on its website on Saturday, include strengthening risk management, supervision, and disclosures on the source and intended use of the funds.  Entrusted loans are a form of inter-company financing in which one firm serves as the ultimate lender and records the loan asset on its balance sheet while banks act as intermediaries for a fee.  The entrusted loans market has grown rapidly in recent years and had some positive effects, the CBRC said, but a lack of standardized regulations meant there were \u201ccertain hidden risks\u201d.  In recent months, Chinese regulators have introduced a series of new measures aimed at controlling risk and leverage in the financial system, with everything from lending practices to shadow banking under the microscope.

          "body": "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Top seed Caroline Wozniacki battled through two matches within the space of just over four hours to set up a final against second seed Julia Goerges at the Auckland Classic on Saturday.  Heavy rain throughout the week in New Zealand\u2019s largest city had caused havoc with the schedule, forcing organizers to play the quarter-finals and both semi-finals on Saturday and move the final to Sunday.  The Dane struggled in her earlier quarter-final against the 19-year-old American wildcard Sofia Kenin before winning the rain-affected match 4-6 6-2 6-4 just before 4pm (0300 GMT).   She returned to center court at the Auckland Tennis Centre at about 5.50pm and then comfortably accounted for American qualifier Sachia Vickery, who had earlier upset third seed Agnieskza Radwanksa, in the 6-4 6-4 win.  \u201cI\u2019m exhausted, if I\u2019m being honest,\u201d Wozniacki told the WTA website after her semi-final.  \u201cIt\u2019s a tough start to the season - you kind of feel it after the first match... in the back, and the legs, and then we didn\u2019t play for a couple of days, and I said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s nice.\u2019  \u201cThen coming out here and playing three sets this morning, and then two sets when we ran a lot \u2014 I\u2019m not 17 anymore, I can feel it for sure!\u201d  Goerges, who lost to American Sloane Stephens in the 2016 Auckland final, was far more comfortable in both of her matches.  She beat Polona Hercog 6-4 6-4 in the quarter-finals before moving into the final with a 6-1 6-4 win over Taiwan\u2019s Hsieh Su-wei.  Wozniacki, who lost the Auckland final to Venus Williams in  2015 and has been a tournament regular in recent years, can move up to number two in the world rankings if she wins the title on Sunday.  \u201cI definitely need a good massage tonight and some great food to just try and be as fresh as possible for tomorrow,\u201d she said.   \u201cIt would be amazing ...obviously, being here in another final means a lot to me, and I would love to make it a step further and win this tournament.\u201d  Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly"

          "body": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman on Saturday ordered a monthly payment of 1,000 riyals ($267) to state employees over the next year in compensation for rising cost of living after the government hiked domestic gas prices and introduced value-added tax (VAT).  In a royal decree published by state news media, the king also ordered the payment of 5,000 riyals to military personnel serving at the front lines with Yemen where the kingdom is fighting a nearly three-year-old war.  Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, roughly doubled gasoline prices on Monday as part of a broad reform initiative aimed at diversifying its economy. A 5 percent VAT on a broad range of goods and services came into effect on the same day.  The new payment orders were an acknowledgment of \u201cthe increased burdens for some segments of the population following from the necessary measures which the state took to restructure the economy,\u201d according to the decree.  King Salman directed the state to bear the burden of VAT in some situations, including special health and education services as well as the first purchase of a house that is valued at up to 850,000 riyals ($226,660). Allowances for students, retirees and social security recipients were also boosted.  The decree did not reveal the total cost of the new allowances, but it appeared to be considerably smaller than some past handouts by Saudi kings, and therefore unlikely to have much impact on economic growth or the state budget deficit.  About 1.18 million Saudis are employed in the government sector and there are more than 1.23 million pensioners and beneficiaries of pension payments, the central bank says. That suggests a total package cost of about 23 billion riyals, according to Reuters calculations.  That compares to a projected 2018 deficit of 195 billion riyals, according to a budget plan released last month. A package of handouts marking King Salman\u2019s accession to the throne in early 2015 was estimated to cost more than 100 billion riyals.  Saudi Arabia will slow plans to eliminate subsidies for a wide range of energy products, according to a new long-term fiscal plan in the 2018 state budget.

          "title": "U.S.-Korea trade talks pit pickup trucks against nuclear threat",
          "body": "WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea on Friday completed the first round of review talks on a bilateral trade deal with Washington saying there was \u201cmuch work to do\u201d to reach a new pact.  Since taking office in 2017, President Donald Trump has pulled the United States out of talks on a 14-nation Asia-Pacific trade pact, started negotiations on a new deal for the North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada and initiated a review of the 2012 Korea deal.  Washington has taken a hard line in the NAFTA talks, which appear stalled with just two rounds of negotiations left, saying that concessions are the only way for Canada and Mexico to keep the deal.  The Korea trade talks will have to strike a balance between Trump\u2019s domestic agenda and the need to contain a nuclear-armed North Korea. A swift agreement would have aided that, officials from both sides told Reuters ahead of the talks on Friday.  The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea has doubled since the 2012 signing of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). Almost 90 percent of the 2016 shortfall of $27.6 billion came from the auto sector, an issue the United States is expected to press hard in the Washington talks.  A quick Korea deal could give Trump his first trade victory at a time when NAFTA negotiations are dragging on and pressure on China to change trade practices has yielded little progress.  The talks, led by Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Michael Beeman and Yoo Myung-hee, director general for FTA negotiations at South Korea\u2019s trade ministry, begin at a time of heightened tension with Pyongyang.  The United States had primarily raised the issue of the automobile sector, Yoo told reporters in Washington after the first round of talks, Yonhap News Agency said, but gave no details.   A top priority for the Americans is maintaining a tariff of 25 percent on imports of Korean pickup trucks, which the existing deal envisaged to be phased out from 2019, according to a U.S. official and a South Korean car industry source.  South Korea has two major automakers, Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, that rely heavily on exports because of the small size of the domestic market. Critics say South Korea discriminates against imports with a range of non-tariff barriers.  South Korean auto companies believe Washington will also seek to increase the 25,000-vehicle per U.S. automaker threshold for U.S. car shipments to South Korea that can enter the country without meeting Seoul\u2019s domestic industry regulations.  The official at a South Korea auto company, who was not authorized to speak to the media, also said the United States was interested in easing Seoul\u2019s vehicle emissions targets. These are viewed as discriminating against U.S. autos.  Since Kim Jong Un took power in North Korea in 2011, Pyongyang has run a series of increasingly powerful nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches, drawing ever tighter sanctions and a freeze on contacts between the two Koreas.  This week, however, Seoul agreed to high-level talks with the North in response to a New Year\u2019s speech in which the North Korean leader offered an opening to diplomacy.  Pyongyang has a long history of seeking to play off Seoul and Washington as well as Beijing and Moscow in its diplomacy. Washington is wary of separate approaches and there are concerns that disagreements over KORUS could fuel a rift between South Korea and the United States.  The election of a left of center government in South Korea has raised concerns in Washington that Seoul may now be more willing to engage in talks. Under two previous right of center South Korean administrations, economic and other links between the countries were severed.  \u201cI have a feeling that we will not take any precipitous action on KORUS for the time being,\u201d a senior U.S. official said while acknowledging that Trump and trade hawks within his administration had concerns over the deal.

          "body": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - U.S. regulators formally launched a review process on Friday that could produce a permit a Canadian mining group needs to build the Pebble Mine copper and gold project in southwest Alaska, which is opposed by environmentalists.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency that regulates the development and dredging of wetlands, has published the completed permit application from the Pebble Limited Partnership on its website.  The application will trigger a formal environmental review of the plan to build an open-pit mine in a region with the world\u2019s biggest sockeye salmon runs.  The proposal to build the mine is moving forward under President Donald Trump, a champion of increased domestic mining, after the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Barack Obama attempted to put the region off limits to large-scale metals mining in 2014.  Backers of the project say it could create 2,000 construction jobs and 850 jobs during operations.  The Pebble Limited Partnership, comprising Canadian miners Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd and First Quantum Minerals Ltd, expects the full review to take three to five years, said spokesman Mike Heatwole.  The mine would extract minerals from a huge deposit of copper, gold and molybdenum and operate for 20 years, according to the Pebble Partnership.  The Pebble Limited Partnership is planning to mine 1.2 billion tons of material, including 287 million pounds of copper.  Environmentalists, commercial and sport fishermen, many Alaska Native tribal organizations and even some Republican politicians have all criticized the project, which would be built on land near Lake Clark National Park.   They argue the mine, which would be located upstream of Bristol Bay and its large salmon runs, would spoil important fish and wildlife habitat. Public opinion polls have consistently found the mine is strongly opposed by Alaska residents.

Pebble Limited Partnership Chief Executive Officer Tom Collier, in a statement Friday, said the company has responded to critics by scaling back the mine scope, eliminating planned use of cyanide and making other changes.  \u201cThese are very substantial improvements that we have made over the past few years in response to issues and concerns raised by project stakeholders,\u201d he said.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Bradie Tennell almost certainly qualified for next month\u2019s Winter Olympics when she won the U.S. figure skating championships title on Friday as Mirai Nagasu achieved redemption four years after her Olympic dream was shattered.  Tennell performed a near flawless routine in the free skate in San Jose, California to increase her margin after starting in front following Wednesday\u2019s short program.  She scored 145.72 points to finish on 219.51. Nagasu was second on 213.84. The 18-year-old Karen Chen finished a distant third on 198.59 to likely claim the third spot on the American team for the Pyeongchang Games.  \u201cI think the sky\u2019s the limit for me,\u201d said 19-year-old Tennell. \u201cI\u2019d been doing clean programs all season so I had a really good base.\u201d  Ashley Wagner, whose selection for the 2014 team was controversial, again finished fourth but is unlikely to be selected again this year after a poor season.  Wagner had been given the third spot in the U.S. team in 2014, despite finishing fourth at the nationals, which had almost forced Nagasu to quit the sport.  The 24-year-old Nagasu, however, ignited the crowd on Friday with her athletic performance and burst into tears of relief on completing a routine that started with a triple Axel before she received an ovation that lasted more than a minute and embraced coach Tom Zakrajsek as she left the ice.  \u201cBeing left off the team (in 2014) has pushed me to become a stronger skater,\u201d she had said beforehand. \u201cIt was a very hard thing to accept.\u201d  The championships continue on Saturday as 18-year-old Nathan Chen takes a big lead into the men\u2019s free skate, while the husband-and-wife team of Chris and Alexa Knierim lead heading into the pairs free skate.

Drew Eubanks amassed 15 points and eight rebounds and Seth Berger had 12 points for the Beavers, who had lost seven of the previous eight in the series.  Forward Paul White had 16 points, six rebounds and five assists for the Ducks, who had won six of seven. He scored 13 points in the first half. Oregon\u2019s Victor Bailey Jr. had 11 points, and MiKyle McIntosh and Payton Pritchard had nine apiece.  Tinkle\u2019s 3-pointer gave the Beavers a 50-43 lead with 10:49 remaining, and Berger\u2019s steal and breakaway layup increased the gap to 57-44 with 8:15 remaining. That capped a 12-1 run as the Ducks went more than four minutes without a field goal.  Oregon (11-5, 1-2) was never closer than 10 thereafter.  Oregon State shot 52.8 percent from the field and held Oregon to 36.2 percent.  The Beavers limited Colorado to 34.5 percent shooting in a 76-57 victory in the Pac-12 opener on Dec. 29. The Beavers opened league play with three consecutive home games.  Pritchard, Oregon\u2019s leading scorer with a 15.4 average, produced all of his points in the second half Friday. He wound up 3 of 10 from the field.  Eubanks\u2019 layup gave Oregon State an 18-13 lead at 12:41 of the first half, the largest advantage for either team in a tight first half.  White, a 6-foot-9 junior, made a layup with two seconds remaining to bring the Ducks within 30-29 at halftime.  White had three points in a 77-62 victory over Colorado last Saturday after missing the previous two games while in the concussion protocol. He was elbowed in the head in a 68-61 victory over Fresno State on Dec. 16.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Guard Josh Richardson hit two free throws with 25.7 seconds left in overtime and forward James Johnson added two more with 7.2 remaining to give the Miami Heat a 107-103 victory over the New York Knicks Friday night in Miami.  The Heat (21-17) outscored the Knicks (18-21) 10-6 after the Knicks sent the game into the extra period when forward Doug McDermott hit a corner 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to tie it at 97.  Guard Wayne Ellington led six Miami players in double figures with a game-high 24 points, including a triple that gave the Heat a 100-99 lead in overtime.  The win was the Heat\u2019s third in a row and put them four games over .500 for the first time in two years.  Guard Courtney Lee scored 24 points to lead the Knicks, who lost for the seventh time in their last eight games. They fell to 3-14 on the road. Former Heat draft pick Michael Beasley added 20, 11 coming in the fourth quarter.  The first half featured seven lead changes and seven ties before the Heat went on a brief 8-1 spurt in the closing minutes of the first half for a 49-41 lead. But the Knicks caught the Heat napping after Dragic\u2019s basket with 2.3 seconds left in the second period. Center Enes Kanter was fouled on a breakaway and his two free throws cut the deficit down to 51-45 at the intermission.  The Heat led by 10 early in the third quarter but the Knicks clawed their way back to 75-71 by the end of the quarter with Lee scoring 11 in the period.  The Knicks got their first lead of the second half when McDermott was fouled on a 3-pointer and converted the free throw for a four-point play and 76-75 score. That ignited a 9-0 run for New York and an 80-75 lead with 9:16 remaining in the game.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Kemba Walker had 19 points, seven assists and four steals as one of six Charlotte players to score in double digits, helping the Hornets roll to a 108-94 victory over the sinking Los Angeles Lakers on Friday at Staples Center in Los Angeles.  Jeremy Lamb scored 17 points and Marvin Williams added 16 for the Hornets, who went 3-1 on a four-game road swing through California. Charlotte center Dwight Howard recorded 15 points and 10 rebounds for his 21st double-double of the season.  Lakers rookie point guard Lonzo Ball returned from a six-game absence caused by a left shoulder injury but couldn\u2019t prevent his team from taking its ninth consecutive loss and 12th in the past 13 games. Ball had 11 points, five assists, four rebounds and just one turnover in 27 minutes.  Brandon Ingram posted 22 points and 14 rebounds for Los Angeles. Julius Randle contributed 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Lakers, who shot just 9 of 36 from 3-point range.  Los Angeles rookie Kyle Kuzma, who entered the contest with a 17.5 scoring average, had a miserable night, finishing with just four points on 2-of-14 shooting.  The Lakers trailed by just nine points early in the third quarter before the game slipped away.  Back-to-back baskets by Michael Kidd-Gilchrist increased Charlotte\u2019s lead to 83-68 with 5:31 remaining, and Frank Kaminsky later connected on a 3-pointer to make the margin 19 with 3:35 to play.  The Hornets led 93-76 entering the final quarter, and the lead reached 20 on two free throws by Michael Carter-Williams with 10:45 remaining. Lamb\u2019s dunk off an alley-oop pass from Treveon Graham made it 103-78 with 8:59 left and prompted the home fans to deliver a vociferous round of boos.  Kidd-Gilchrist (13 points) and Kaminsky (12) were the other two Hornets in double digits.  Walker registered 14 points and six assists in the first half as the Hornets led 63-48 at the break.  Charlotte led by four after the opening quarter before Lamb and Carter-Williams drained 3-pointers to make it 34-24. The lead reached 50-35 when Walker knocked down a 3-pointer.  Ingram had 14 points and nine rebounds in the opening half.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Bradie Tennell almost certainly qualified for next month\u2019s Winter Olympics when she won the U.S. figure skating championships title on Friday as Mirai Nagasu achieved redemption four years after her Olympic dream was shattered.  Tennell performed a near flawless routine in the free skate in San Jose, California to increase her margin after starting in front following Wednesday\u2019s short program.  She scored 145.72 points to finish on 219.51. Nagasu was second on 213.84. The 18-year-old Karen Chen finished a distant third on 198.59 to likely claim the third spot on the American team for the Pyeongchang Games.  \u201cI think the sky\u2019s the limit for me,\u201d said 19-year-old Tennell. \u201cI\u2019d been doing clean programs all season so I had a really good base.\u201d  Ashley Wagner, whose selection for the 2014 team was controversial, again finished fourth but is unlikely to be selected again this year after a poor season.  Wagner had been given the third spot in the U.S. team in 2014, despite finishing fourth at the nationals, which had almost forced Nagasu to quit the sport.  The 24-year-old Nagasu, however, ignited the crowd on Friday with her athletic performance and burst into tears of relief on completing a routine that started with a triple Axel before she received an ovation that lasted more than a minute and embraced coach Tom Zakrajsek as she left the ice.  \u201cBeing left off the team (in 2014) has pushed me to become a stronger skater,\u201d she had said beforehand. \u201cIt was a very hard thing to accept.\u201d  The championships continue on Saturday as 18-year-old Nathan Chen takes a big lead into the men\u2019s free skate, while the husband-and-wife team of Chris and Alexa Knierim lead heading into the pairs free skate.
