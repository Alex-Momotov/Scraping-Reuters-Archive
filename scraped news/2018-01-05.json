          "title": "Isolated looting hits Mexico amid price rise jitters",
          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities and media reported looting of stores in the states of Mexico and Veracruz on Thursday following a flurry of social media posts about increases in the prices of gasoline and tortillas this year.   At least 70 people were arrested in the state of Mexico on Thursday after looting in two cities, a spokesman for state police said.  At least 800 police were deployed to deter looting at stores in the state, according to a Twitter post by state police.   In the state of Veracruz, two people were arrested for using social media to incite looting in a suburb of the port capital, media reported.   Mexico\u2019s government on Wednesday denounced forecast price rises by fuel retailers and tortilla makers, saying increases were unjustified as it sought to allay public concern about high inflation at the start of a presidential election year.  As inflation hovers near a 16-year high just below 7 percent, officials insisted the forecast price spikes, which have triggered social media outrage and threats of protests, are not warranted.  Early last year, Mexico saw violent protests and looting after the government cut subsidies to gasoline prices as it moved toward a free market from a state-controlled regime.  Mexican authorities have insisted that price increases in recent months have been modest, noting gasoline prices have only risen 1.3 percent compared to average prices at the end of November.

          "body": "USC outscored California 28-0 during three first-half runs Thursday night, building a big lead that the Trojans rode to an 80-62 romp over the Golden Bears in Pacific-12 Conference play in Berkeley, Calif.  Nick Rakocevic had 19 points, Bennie Boatwright 15 and Jordan Usher 14 for USC (11-5, 2-1 Pac-12). The Trojans won despite having to play the first half without one of their top players, Chimezie Metu, who was suspended.  The Trojans turned to a suffocating defense to put the game away before their junior big man, who was penalized for a flagrant foul in a Saturday win over Washington State, was allowed to join the action for the final 20 minutes.  Cal, coming off a conference-opening win at Stanford, trailed just 10-8 six minutes into the game before USC pulled away.  It began with an 11-0 Trojans run during which the Bears (7-8, 1-1) missed eight consecutive shots and committed five turnovers over a stretch of almost five minutes.  After Juhwan Harris-Dyson ended that Cal drought and cut the deficit to 21-10, the Trojans ran off another eight straight points, during which the Bears committed six turnovers in 5 1/2 minutes.  USC then responded to a Kingsley Okoroh jumper with its best offensive flurry of the half, getting a 3-pointer from Usher, a dunk from Shaqquan Aaron and consecutive interior hoops from Elijah Stewart in a 9-0 burst over a span of just 1:19 to completely break the game open at 38-12.  The Trojans led 41-20 at the half. With Metu contributing six points after the break, USC was never seriously threatened in the second half en route to just its second true road win of the season.  Rakocevic hit eight of his 11 shots and Usher six of his seven for the Trojans, who shot 46.2 from the field.  Justice Sueing led Cal with 15 points, while Marcus Lee and Harris-Dyson added 10 apiece.  Cal finished the game with 22 turnovers against a USC defense that forced an average of just 12.8 in its first 15 games.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Mikko Rantanen\u2019s wrister beat Sergei Bobrovsky for the decisive goal in the second period as the Colorado Avalanche beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 2-0 for their fourth straight win Thursday night at the Pepsi Center in Denver.  Rantanen\u2019s shot came from the top of the circle on a power play, giving him 14 goals on the season. His scoring total ranks third on the team behind Nathan MacKinnon (17) and Gabriel Landeskog (16).  Matt Nieto scored his seventh goal of the season for Colorado (21-16-3), which has outscored its opponents 15-6 during its winning streak.  Jonathan Bernier anchored the Avalanche with his second shutout of the year, making 34 saves.  The Avs were playing without No. 1 goalie Semyon Varlamov, who sustained a lower-body injury in Tuesday\u2019s 3-2 overtime victory against Winnipeg. Varlamov exited in the second period with what the team later called a muscular injury.  Varlamov, 29, is officially day-to-day and could return Saturday against Minnesota.  Bobrovsky was the hard-luck loser and finished with 30 saves for Columbus (23-16-3), which lost for the fourth time in five games following Tuesday\u2019s 2-1 victory at Dallas.  After a scoreless first period, the Avs scored quickly after a faceoff, with Rantanen taking a feed from Tyson Jost and firing it past Bobrovsky stickside at 12:48 of the second. Samuel Girard was also credited with an assist on the goal.  With the Blue Jackets pressing for the equalizer in the third, the Avs put the game out of reach with Nieto\u2019s goal at the 18:25 mark. MacKinnon got the primary assist on Nieto\u2019s strike while Rantanen logged the secondary.  Colorado\u2019s game against the Wild on Saturday wraps up a six-game homestand. Columbus returns home to face Florida on Sunday.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "title": "White House, senators seek Iran measure ahead of nuclear deadline",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators and Trump administration officials met at the White House on Thursday, hoping to hammer out compromise legislation to tighten restrictions on Iran while keeping Washington in an international nuclear deal with Tehran.  Senators Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Ben Cardin, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, had an evening meeting with President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, to discuss possible legislation, Senate and White House aides said.  The stakes have risen in the past week with anti-government protests in several Iranian cities over economic hardships and corruption, the boldest challenge to Iran\u2019s leadership in a decade.  Worrying European allies who co-signed the 2015 accord, Trump has railed against the deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for loosening sanctions reached under his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. In October, the Republican president announced that he would not certify that staying in the pact was in the U.S. national security interest, and threatened to pull out if lawmakers did not act to toughen it.  Members of Congress have been working since to come up with a bipartisan compromise that would give Trump enough political cover not to reimpose sanctions on Iranian oil before a deadline next week, an action that would kill the pact.  Aides said they were looking at measures including ending the requirement that Trump re-certify the agreement every 90 days and changing some of the so-called sunset provisions to allow the reimposition of U.S. sanctions, with no timetable, if Iran\u2019s nuclear program reaches certain thresholds.  Ahead of the meeting, Corker said he hoped enough progress had been made that Trump might not restore the sanctions.  \u201cMy sense is there\u2019s a little momentum right now, and it doesn\u2019t feel to me like we\u2019re in a place where the president might do that, but who knows,\u201d he told reporters at the Capitol.  Corker said the protests in Iran made it more important that Washington not do anything to shift the focus from Iran\u2019s government. \u201cThe last thing we need to do from my perspective would be to turn that attention to us,\u201d he said.  The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet Friday at 3 p.m. to discuss Iran, days after U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley called for an emergency session to discuss the protests.  The U.S. proposal was dismissed by Russia, another participant in the nuclear deal, as \u201charmful and destructive,\u201d with \u201cno role for the United Nations Security Council in this issue.\u201d  A procedural vote which no council member can veto could be used to stop the meeting. If nine of the 15 countries on the council vote to stop the meeting that would end the discussion.   \u201cThis is a matter of fundamental human rights for the Iranian people, but it is also a matter of international peace and security,\u201d said Haley in a statement late on Thursday.  \u201cIt will be telling if any country tries to deny the Security Council from even having this discussion.\u201d   Separately, the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday sanctioned five Iranian-based entities it said were owned or controlled by an industrial firm responsible for developing and producing Iran\u2019s solid-propellant ballistic missiles.  \u201cThese sanctions target key entities involved in Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, which the Iranian regime prioritizes over the economic well-being of the Iranian people,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.  The department said the sanctioned entities - the Shahid Eslami Research Center, Shahid Kharrazi Industries, Shahid Moghaddam Industries, Shahid Sanikhani Industries and Shahid Shustari Industries - were subordinated to the Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group.  The sanctions freeze any property the entities hold in the United States and prohibit Americans from dealing with them.

          "body": "Ryan Nugent-Hopkins scored the decisive shootout goal as the Edmonton Oilers edged the visiting Anaheim Ducks 2-1 on Thursday night.  Kris Russell scored in regulation for the Oilers, who posted their second consecutive win.  Ryan Kesler tallied for the Ducks, who saw their three-game winning streak end.  Edmonton goaltender Cam Talbot and Anaheim counterpart John Gibson were both credited with 33 saves, and they each faced 34 shots.  The Oilers (18-20-3) outshot the Ducks 13-2 in the first period but could not beat Gibson, who returned between the pipes after getting a night off Tuesday when Anaheim won in Vancouver.  Russell opened the scoring on a power play at 11:58 of the second frame. He converted a pass from Connor McDavid during a three-on-two rush following a quick breakout from the Edmonton zone. With the assist, McDavid ended his pointless drought at three games.  Kesler created a 1-1 tie only 18 seconds into the third period on a double-deflection. He knocked in the puck after teammate Jakob Silfverberg also got his stick on defenseman Cam Fowler\u2019s shot. The goal was the first of the season for Kesler, who only resumed playing recently after recuperating from offseason hip injury.  Gibson withstood some severe pressure from the Oilers late in the third period to force overtime.  The Oilers got a power play early in overtime after the Ducks\u2019 Antoine Vermette was penalized for high-sticking McDavid late in the third period, but Gibson remained stellar again. Edmonton received another power play with 22 seconds left in the extra session as Fowler was sent off for slashing Darnell Nurse.  Before Nugent-Hopkins netted the winner, Anaheim\u2019s Rickard Rakell and Edmonton\u2019s Michael Cammalleri traded goals in the shootout. However, the shootout tally did not prevent Rakell\u2019s goals streak from ending at six games.  The Oilers played without winger Patrick Maroon, who served the first of a two-game suspension for a high hit on Los Angeles Kings defenseman Drew Doughty. Winger Corey Perry missed his 11th consecutive game with a knee injury for the Ducks (19-14-9).  During the game, the Oilers acquired goaltender Al Montoya from the Montreal Canadiens in return for a conditional 2018 fourth-round draft choice.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "BENGALURU (Reuters) - Asian currencies are set to pare gains this year that they made in 2017 as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further and Asian central banks proceed cautiously, cushioned by solid growth expectations, a Reuters poll showed.  After four years of depreciation, Asia FX bounced back in 2017 owing in part to a rebound in exports, a synchronized global recovery, and investors reaching again for more risk.   The South Korean won - among the best performers in Asia last year - rose over 11 percent against the dollar, while others have all appreciated more than 6 percent.   But according to over 60 foreign exchange strategists polled this week, most major Asian currencies will slip back a few percentage points by the end of this year. Only some are expected to make modest gains.  \u201cHow Asian currencies fare in 2018 depends on the effects of policy normalization in the major advanced economies on global liquidity and ultimately on portfolio flows to Asia; and a strengthening and broadening in Asian economic growth with export recovery spilling over into domestic demand,\u201d wrote strategists at ANZ in their 2018 FX outlook note.  \u201cWe see growth winning out in the end, though the currency moves in the region will be more diffused with growth-sensitive currencies outperforming, while high yielding currencies and those with external deficits underperforming.\u201d  The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, lost about 10 percent in 2017 owing to uncertainty over whether President Donald Trump\u2019s administration would be able to pass sweeping tax cuts.     Despite that success just before the end of 2017, traders remain unsure about the economic impact of those cuts, which will cost over 1 trillion in additional borrowing over a decade.  The greenback\u2019s ability to recover losses made in 2017 in the current year depends on the Fed\u2019s interest rate pathway.  Despite the Fed hiking rates three times last year, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield failed to rise, ending 2017 at 2.41 percent, a tad lower than 2016\u2019s close of 2.43 percent.  But if yields go up in 2018 on the back of expected further policy tightening by the Fed, Asian currencies could start to lag as investors rebalance their portfolios.   After gaining over 6 percent last year, China\u2019s yuan is forecast to depreciate slightly to 6.60 per dollar in six months and to 6.60 by end-2018, from Thursday\u2019s close of 6.49, the poll showed.  The yuan rose to its firmest against the U.S. dollar in nearly four months on Tuesday, breaching a key threshold, supported by a stronger fixing and broad dollar weakness.  \u201cDuring the recent phase of U.S. dollar weakness, the government has allowed a strong appreciation against the dollar, while the CNY has moved more or less sideways against the currency basket since April,\u201d said Ulrich Leuchtmann, research head at Commerzbank in a note to clients.  On Wednesday, the People's Bank of China allowed the yuan mid-point reference rate CNY=PBOC to appreciate to its highest since May 2016 of 6.49 per dollar, which is 6 percent more than its closing value that year.  \u201cThe volatility in USD/CNY is ... likely to remain higher in the future. The government is likely to react more sensitively to a CNY devaluation than to an appreciation, in order to prevent a capital flight from flaring up again after it was only stopped by extensive controls on capital movements in 2015 and 2016,\u201d Leuchtmann said.  India\u2019s rupee is also forecast to depreciate marginally against the dollar, to 64.50 per dollar in six months and 65.00 in a year, compared with Thursday\u2019s close of 63.39.  \u201cIf current account deficits were to get too large, India could be vulnerable to sudden episodes of panic by foreign investors that could lead to sharp declines in the value of the Indian rupee,\u201d said Wells Fargo strategist Erik Nelson.  \u201cHowever, we think for the medium to long-term the outlook is pretty constructive,\u201d said Nelson, who is optimistic that India\u2019s economy will perform better after a slowdown last year.  That was induced in part by a shock removal of most of India\u2019s currency in circulation announced in late 2016, as well as the implementation of a new national Goods and Services Tax.  \u201cWe did have some disruptions initially, but now I think we are probably going to start to reap the rewards, or benefits of those reforms, particularly the GST tax,\u201d Nelson added.

After yet another slow start in which they fell behind by a 2-0 score, the Flames (20-16-4) erased that deficit with authority during what might have been their best 20 minutes of action this season.  Ferland, with his career-high 16th goal of the season, Troy Brouwer, Mark Jankowski and Monahan all beat Kings goalie Jonathan Quick in the middle frame, after which the hosts received a standing ovation from the crowd.  The Flames held a 17-5 edge in shots on goal during the period.  Johnny Gaudreau also had a two-point game, assisting the goals by Ferland and Monahan for the Flames, who have won two straight to finally pull their home record to .500 (11-11-0)  Flames goalie Mike Smith made 28 saves, almost half of them in the opening frame, to record the win.  With an opportunity to close ground on the Pacific Division-leading Vegas Golden Knights, the visiting Kings made great headway early in the contest against Calgary.  Defenseman Derek Forbort opened the scoring for the Kings before the five minute mark with his first goal in 94 games, tallying for the first time since Dec. 15, 2016.  Then, Tanner Pearson doubled the lead for Los Angeles when he neatly backhanded a shot past Smith in the final minute of the opening frame.  Pearson added his second of the night with 91 seconds remaining in regulation, but that\u2019s as close as the Kings (24-12-5) could make it despite a furious push in the dying minutes.

The yuan rose to its firmest against the U.S. dollar in nearly four months on Tuesday, breaching a key threshold, supported by a stronger fixing and broad dollar weakness.  \u201cDuring the recent phase of U.S. dollar weakness, the government has allowed a strong appreciation against the dollar, while the CNY has moved more or less sideways against the currency basket since April,\u201d said Ulrich Leuchtmann, research head at Commerzbank in a note to clients.  On Wednesday, the People's Bank of China allowed the yuan mid-point reference rate CNY=PBOC to appreciate to its highest since May 2016 of 6.49 per dollar, which is 6 percent more than its closing value that year.  \u201cThe volatility in USD/CNY is ... likely to remain higher in the future. The government is likely to react more sensitively to a CNY devaluation than to an appreciation, in order to prevent a capital flight from flaring up again after it was only stopped by extensive controls on capital movements in 2015 and 2016,\u201d Leuchtmann said.  India\u2019s rupee is also forecast to depreciate marginally against the dollar, to 64.50 per dollar in six months and 65.00 in a year, compared with Thursday\u2019s close of 63.39.  \u201cIf current account deficits were to get too large, India could be vulnerable to sudden episodes of panic by foreign investors that could lead to sharp declines in the value of the Indian rupee,\u201d said Wells Fargo strategist Erik Nelson.  \u201cHowever, we think for the medium to long-term the outlook is pretty constructive,\u201d said Nelson, who is optimistic that India\u2019s economy will perform better after a slowdown last year.  That was induced in part by a shock removal of most of India\u2019s currency in circulation announced in late 2016, as well as the implementation of a new national Goods and Services Tax.  \u201cWe did have some disruptions initially, but now I think we are probably going to start to reap the rewards, or benefits of those reforms, particularly the GST tax,\u201d Nelson added.

          "body": "Christian Fischer\u2019s goal 2:19 into overtime Thursday night capped a late comeback that gave the Arizona Coyotes a 3-2 win over the Nashville Predators at Gila River Arena in Glendale, Ariz.  Fischer\u2019s 11th goal of the season came off a pass from Jacob Chychrun, enabling Arizona (10-27-5) to reach double-digit victories in its first game of the season\u2019s second half. The goal survived a video review.  While the Coyotes celebrated just their third win in 13 games, Nashville (23-11-6) fell to 2-4-2 over its past eight games. The Predators lost despite controlling long stretches of play against the NHL\u2019s worst team, finishing with a 39-25 advantage in shots on goal.  Arizona forced overtime when Nick Cousins poked a rebound past Juuse Saros at 17:11 of the third period, one second before the end of a power play. Cousins was responsible for putting the Coyotes in the man advantage, drawing an interference call from Austin Watson.  Nashville scored on its last shot of the second period, then its first shot of the third period. The two goals in 17 seconds erased a 1-0 deficit.  Ryan Ellis, playing his second game since injuring his knee during Game 5 of last season\u2019s Stanley Cup Finals, scored his first goal at 19:51 of the middle period. Off a faceoff win by Colton Sissons, Ellis whipped a wrister by Antti Raanta from between the circles. It was the Predators\u2019 first shot on goal in more than 14 minutes.  Craig Smith gave Nashville its first lead just eight seconds into the third period. After taking the puck away along the right boards, Smith skated just past the right circle and roofed a wrister over Raanta for his 14th goal of the season.  Anthony Duclair\u2019s eighth goal of the season at 12:41 of the second period gave the Coyotes a 1-0 lead.  Raanta (6-11-2) made 37 saves, while Saros (4-3-3) stopped 22 shots.  The Predators have dried up offensively over the past five games, scoring only nine goals.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Arizona (12-3, 2-0 Pac-12) beat Utah for 11th time in the last 12 games between the two teams.  Sedrick Barefield scored 23 points to lead Utah and dished out six assists, with 20 points coming in the second half. David Collette added 19 points while Tyler Rawson tallied 16 and Justin Bibbins chipped in 14 points and eight assists. The Utes (10-4, 2-1 Pac-12) trailed by as many as 17 points, but came up short in a second-half rally.  Arizona owned a major edge on the glass to stay a step ahead of Utah. The Wildcats finished with a 46-23 advantage on rebounds. They had 14 offensive rebounds, which they turned into 23 second-chance points.  Utah struggled to find its shot in the first half, going 36.7 percent from the field. The Utes converted 8 of 9 layup attempts, but shot 3-of-21 on their other field goal attempts. It opened the door for the Wildcats to take control, which they didn\u2019t let go to waste.  Arizona scored on six straight possessions to open up a 31-14 lead with 7:37 left in the first half. Alkins got the run going with a jumper, and Ayton finished it off with a dunk.  The Utes rallied and shaved Arizona\u2019s lead in half, cutting it to 36-28 on a layup from Donnie Tillman.

Ayton hit a jumper, Allonzo Trier followed with a 3-point play and Jackson-Cartwright dialed up a 3-pointer over three straight possessions to put the Wildcats ahead 44-30 heading into the final minute before halftime.

The senior drained a pair of 3-pointers and hit three free throws over three straight possessions to trim Arizona\u2019s lead to 61-59.  The Utes tied it up three times late in the half, the third time at 77-77 on a pair of free throws from Collette with 3:46 left. Ayton buried a jumper in the lane to keep Utah from taking the lead and spark a 11-0 run that put the Wildcats back up 88-77 with 1:31 remaining.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, January 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings says Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. Ltd.'s (BB/Rating Watch Negative) proposed issuance of an additional USD100 million of its USD500 million 5.875% senior notes due 2023 will not affect the 'BB' rating on the bond. The proposed tap issuance will also be issued by Easy Tactic Limited, a subsidiary of Guangzhou R&F, which issued the existing notes. The tap issuance will carry the same terms and conditions as the existing notes, and they are rated at the same level as Guangzhou R&F's senior unsecured rating because they constitute its direct and senior unsecured obligations of the company. Guangzhou R&F's leverage, as measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, weakened to 69% at end-1H17, from 63% at end-2016, following aggressive expansion. Fitch believes its land bank of 49 million square metres is now sufficient for more than six years of sales and, therefore, Guangzhou R&F is likely to slow land acquisition in 2H17. However, the weakened credit metrics have made it more probable that the Rating Watch Negative (RWN) will be resolved with, at best, a Negative Outlook on Guangzhou R&F's 'BB' ratings, if affirmed. Guangzhou R&F's ratings were put on RWN following its plan to acquire Dalian Wanda Commercial Property Co. Ltd.'s (BB+/RWN) hotel assets for CNY19 billion. Fitch believes the acquisition will push up Guangzhou R&F's total debt and keep its leverage above Fitch's 60% threshold for negative rating action. The company's churn rate, as measured by contracted sales/gross debt, is likely to fall below 0.6x and may stay below this level, which will breach Fitch's threshold and may result in a rating downgrade if recurring EBITDA does not increase sufficiently to provide an offset.

          "title": "Trump targets book, threatens ex-ally Bannon with legal action",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer said on Thursday he would try to stop publication of a book that portrays an inept president in a fumbling White House and threatened legal action against former top aide Steve Bannon over \u201cdefamatory\u201d comments in the book.  \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by author Michael Wolff set off a political firestorm with its portrayal of Trump as not particularly wanting to win the U.S. presidency in 2016 and unprepared for the job.  Some of the harshest commentary came from Bannon, the right-wing firebrand who headed the final stage of Trump\u2019s campaign and became chief strategist at the White House before being fired in August.  Charles Harder, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, in a legal notice provided to Reuters, warned of possible claims including libel against Wolff and publisher Henry Holt & Co and threatened to try to block publication of the book. Harder also told Reuters that \u201clegal action is imminent\u201d against Bannon.  Henry Holt said in a statement it had received a cease-and-desist letter from Trump\u2019s attorney but would go ahead with publishing the book.  Earlier, the publishing house said that \u201cdue to unprecedented demand,\u201d it would release the book on Friday morning, rushing it to print after previously planning to put it out next Tuesday.  Wolff did not respond to a request for comment.  Trump tweeted on Thursday night: \u201cI authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don\u2019t exist. Look at this guy\u2019s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!\u201d  Trump cut ties with Bannon on Wednesday, saying his former adviser had \u201clost his mind,\u201d in a blistering statement issued after comments attributed to Bannon in the book were made public.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders heaped scorn on Bannon and the book at her briefing on Thursday. She said Breitbart News should consider firing Bannon and attempted to cast doubt on Wolff\u2019s accuracy.  She called the book \u201csome trash\u201d that came from \u201can author that no one had ever heard of until today.\u201d  \u201cThis book is mistake after mistake after mistake,\u201d she said.  Trump lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter to Bannon on Wednesday asking him not to disclose any confidential information. They said Bannon had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump, his family and the campaign and made \u201cdisparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements\u201d about them.  In the book, Bannon was quoted as describing a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d The meeting, held after the Russians promised damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, was attended by Donald Trump Jr., Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time.  Trump\u2019s statement also diminished Bannon\u2019s role in the election victory and accused him of leaking to the media. Before joining the campaign, Bannon headed the conservative Breitbart News website and proved to be a divisive figure in the White House. He returned to Breitbart after being fired, although he is reported to have continued to talk with Trump.  Bannon\u2019s reaction to the book controversy has been muted. In interviews with Breitbart News after the news broke, he called Trump a \u201cgreat man\u201d and pledged continued support for the president\u2019s agenda.  The president took note. \u201cHe called me a great man last night so he obviously changed his tune pretty quick,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to him. That\u2019s a misnomer.\u201d   Bradley Moss, a Washington lawyer specializing in national security law, said any non-disclosure agreement would not apply to Bannon once he became a government employee. The government has far less power to limit speech by employees than private companies, Moss said.  A lawsuit could hurt Trump because Bannon\u2019s lawyers would be entitled to interview White House officials and collect potentially damaging documents from them in his defense, Moss said.  \u201cI assume the cease-and-desist letter is aimed primarily at the public,\u201d added Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School. \u201cThe idea that he could block publication is absurd.\u201d  On Thursday, the White House also said no personal devices, including cellphones, would be allowed in the White House West Wing beginning next week for security purposes. The moves followed the Bannon split but had been considered for some time, White House officials said.  Bannon helped Trump shape a populist, anti-establishment message and had been the president\u2019s link to his hard-line conservative base of support, which is often at odds with the Republican Party establishment.  The story that triggered the Trump-Bannon split was an offshoot of the investigation into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia to sway the election to Trump, allegations Trump and Moscow deny.  Manafort and business associate Rick Gates, another campaign aide, pleaded not guilty in November to federal charges brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller including conspiracy to launder money. Manafort sued Mueller on Wednesday, alleging that his investigation exceeded its legal authority.

The price was just over half that of last year\u2019s winning bid of 72 million yen and well below the record 155 million yen paid in 2013.   \u201cI\u2019ve tried to win in the auction since last year, so I\u2019m really happy,\u201d said Onodera, whose company has restaurants in New York and Singapore as well as in Japan. \u201cThis is especially true because it\u2019s the last year in Tsukiji.\u201d  Tuna is prized around the world for its use in sushi, but experts warn growing demand has made it an endangered species.  \u201cThe high price paid today for a single Pacific bluefin tuna should not distract from the dire status of the species, which has been depleted by more than 97 percent by years of overfishing,\u201d said Jamie Gibbon, a Pacific bluefin tuna expert for the Pew Charitable Trusts, in a statement.  \u201cIf countries continue to exceed their catch limits...the very survival of the species will be threatened.\u201d  The 80-year-old Tsukiji market draws tens of thousands of visitors a year to its warren of stalls with exotic species of fish and fresh sushi, part of a tourism boom that is a key part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic revival plan.   \u201cThis will truly be the final auction here, so I made sure I came to watch,\u201d said Mitsuko Yamaguchi, the 61-year-old owner of a seafood store.

Kyle Washington scored 18 points and Evans added 14 for the Bearcats (13-2, 2-0 American). Cincinnati posted its fifth win in a row.  Temple led 50-48 with 2:21 left when Owls coach Fran Dunphy was whistled for a technical foul when his water bottle landed on the court after a foul was called. He insisted it was an accident, but Clark hit one of two free throws and Washington buried a 3-pointer to put Cincinnati ahead 52-50.  With 18.7 seconds left, Temple\u2019s Alani Moore was fouled by Jarron Cumberland attempting a 3-pointer. Moore, a 62 percent free-throw shooter, made all three foul shots to tie the score, setting up Evans\u2019 heroics.  Obi Enechionyia scored 14 points and Shizz Alston Jr. added 12 for the Owls (7-7, 0-3 American). Temple lost its fourth consecutive game and three straight to Cincinnati.  Bearcats backup point guard Cane Broome missed his second straight game with a sprained ankle, and Cincinnati missed him.  Justin Jenifer led Cincinnati with nine points in the first half but also committed three of the team\u2019s 13 turnovers. The Bearcats wound up with 16 turnovers on the night, and Jenifer didn\u2019t score in the second half.  Enechionyia and Alston Jr. each scored eight points in the half for the Owls, who didn\u2019t score in the final 3:54 before the break. Cincinnati scored four points in that span but trailed 29-26 at halftime.  With 16:25 remaining in the game, both Washington and Clark had three fouls, further hampering the Bearcats\u2019 inside game. However, Washington scored 10 consecutive points to keep Cincinnati close.  A three-point play by Nate Pierre-Louis and a jumper by De\u2019Vondre Perry put Temple ahead 46-38 with eight minutes left, but the Bearcats rallied.  Cincinnati leads the all-time series 20-9, including wins in both meetings last season, but Temple had been a thorn in the Bearcats\u2019 side in previous years.

          "title": "New year same as old for first-round leader Leishman",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Marc Leishman rang in the new year much the same way that he ended the old, with a sizzling performance that earned him the first-round lead at the Sentry Tournament of Champions in Hawaii on Thursday.  The Australian set the tone for his day with a five-foot birdie at the first hole en route to a six-under-par 67 at the Kapalua Plantation course on the island of Maui.  Leishman heads Venezuelan Jhonattan Vegas and American Brian Harman by one stroke, with world number one Dustin Johnson among a trio two behind.  While Johnson started solidly, some of the big names in the 34-man field battled to dust off Christmas rust, none more so than Jordan Spieth.  World number two Spieth recorded his first ever over-par score at Kapalua, a 75 that left him ahead of only three players in the small but elite 34-man field.  Spieth said he had made some \u201csignificant changes\u201d in his putting set-up over the past month that he expects will take several rounds to feel comfortable.  While Spieth struggled, Leishman offered a reminder that behind the superstars lurk a bunch of players capable of winning any given week.  \u201cPlayed well, drove ball pretty well with exception of a couple of drives and putter was really solid,\u201d Leishman told Golf Channel. \u201cHappy with eight birdies, good start to a nice tournament.\u201d  He starts 2018 the highest-ranked Australian, 12th in the world, after a hot finish to 2017 that included a victory, a second, a third and a fourth-placing in his final six global starts.   Leishman won the BMW Championship in September, and his runner-up finish was a playoff loss to Thomas at the CJ Cup @ Nine Bridges in South Korea in October.  \u201cReally high,\u201d he said of his confidence level. \u201cGood results help with that obviously. I know I\u2019m not owed anything but confidence certainly make it easier to play well.\u201d  Vegas is also coming off a good year during which he climbed into the top 50 in the world, with he hopes more to come.  Like Leishman, he knows he can beat the best when he hits it straight.  \u201cIt\u2019s a big key for my game to drive it well,\u201d Vegas said.  \u201cI hit my irons as well as some of the best on tour and if I\u2019m able to keep it in play, and give myself good positions to attack hole locations I\u2019m going to get a lot of birdie opportunities.  \u201cLast year was pretty good year for me, moved into top 50 in the world. This year I want to move even higher, somewhere in the 20s.\u201d  Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; editing by Amlan Chakraborty"

          "body": "The Dallas Stars scored three unanswered goals in the second period Thursday night and held on for a 4-3 win over the visiting New Jersey Devils at American Airlines Center.  Alexander Radulov, Brett Ritchie and Tyler Seguin scored within a 12-minute span for the Stars, whose third win in four games (3-1-0) allowed them to maintain sole possession of the first Western Conference wild-card position.  Ritchie\u2019s goal came on a power play created by an interference penalty assessed to Devils defenseman Sami Vatanen, putting Dallas in front 2-1. Seguin extended the lead to 3-1 with a short-handed goal that occurred 1:53 after Stars defenseman Greg Pateryn was whistled for hooking.  After New Jersey\u2019s Taylor Hall cut the deficit to 3-2 in the last minute of the second period, Mattias Janmark scored what proved to be the game-winning goal 9:43 into the third for the Stars (23-16-3).  Dallas goalie Ben Bishop recorded 39 saves.  Brian Boyle opened the scoring in the first period for the Devils, who lost their fourth straight (0-2-2) and missed an opportunity to tie the idle Washington Capitals for first place in the Metropolitan Division. The four-game losing streak is the second of the season for New Jersey, which went 0-2-2 from Nov. 3-9.  Kyle Palmieri pulled New Jersey within one goal with 4:01 left in the third.  The Devils (22-11-7) peppered Bishop in the waning seconds of the third period but could not score the equalizer. Bishop made a pair of spectacular saves on a tip-in attempt by Palmieri and a put-back attempt by Hall in the final 10 seconds.  New Jersey goalie Cory Schneider made 29 saves.  The Stars earned a split of the season series, as the Devils recorded a 5-2 win in New Jersey on Dec. 15.  The Stars continue a six-game homestand Saturday, when they host the Edmonton Oilers. The Devils are scheduled to conclude a four-game road trip Sunday, when they visit the New York Islanders.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "title": "Sterling 2018 outlook steady, but much depends on Brexit - Reuters poll",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The British pound is set to mostly hold steady against both a shaky dollar and the firming euro this year, but much will hinge on progress in Britain\u2019s talks with Brussels on its withdrawal from the European Union.   Currency strategists polled by Reuters in the first week of 2018 weren\u2019t brimming with optimism on how the next stage of talks will go, but most do not think the pound is set for another major fall, either.   The results suggest growing risks for the British currency following its largest annual rally since 2009. Sterling rallied 10 percent last year, in large part because the U.S. dollar marked its worst performance in 14 years.  But the pound is still down about 10 percent from the around  $1.50, where it was trading before British voters rejected EU membership in a referendum. And it is down 30 percent from the more than $2 nearly a decade ago, before the crisis.  Indeed, at $1.35, the pound is still below the lowest close it reached in the first quarter of 2009 as the Great Recession gripped Britain\u2019s economy and most of the developed world.  \u201cTo us, the UK currency remains fundamentally undervalued and markets are still pricing in a generous set of Brexit related risks,\u201d noted analysts at Investec.  \u201cBut in contrast with our prediction of a pound rally a year ago, we are more cautious.\u201d  Market doubts over whether a trade deal can be done may hurt sterling, as would delaying any agreement until early 2019. Markets focussing on implications of a possible Labour government could also hold back the pound, they said.  Investec forecasts $1.40 on the pound by the end of the year, considerably higher than the $1.36 median forecast in the January Reuters Poll. Their 87p forecast for the pound against the euro is also a bit stronger than the median view for 89p.  Dealers and leveraged funds remained mostly long sterling in the final week of 2017, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, although asset managers and institutional players are mostly betting against it.   Indeed, while median forecasts in the latest poll were slightly firmer for the end of the year, considerable disagreement remains among analysts based in the UK, Europe, the United States and Canada, on sterling\u2019s prospects in 2018.  \u201cThe pound is likely to weaken in the near-term as the costs of Brexit become more tangible, but could eventually surge if the UK reverses its decision to leave the EU,\u201d wrote William Adams of Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services.  A Reuters poll taken about a month ago saw that as the least likely of outcomes, but also put the chances of a disorderly Brexit at just 25 percent.  Sterling got an unexpected lift late last year from the Bank of England\u2019s blunt messaging ahead of the 25-basis-point interest rate rise it delivered in November, which most analysts said at the time was a policy error.  While median forecasts point to one more rate rise this year, it\u2019s not likely to come until late 2018 [ECILT/GB].  With many now expecting UK inflation to start slipping following the sterling-induced boost last year, the currency is vulnerable to bad economic news and further obstacles in Britain\u2019s rocky path towards leaving the EU.  But only a handful of forecasters expect a drop to $1.20, the lowest forecast in the latest Reuters poll across the horizon.   \u201cA fall to GBP/USD 1.20 would require, above all else, a stronger U.S. dollar rather than a weaker pound alone,\u201d noted Kit Juckes of Societe Generale in their 2018 FX outlook.   \u201cWe think the chances of a fall that far are about 5 percent, whereas, by contrast, the chances of GBP/USD reaching 1.50 are around 15 percent, reflecting the possibility of another election being called and speculation emerging in earnest, that the UK could see a second Brexit referendum. That is unlikely but not impossible and not definitely priced in by the FX market.\u201d   Polling by Indradip Ghosh and Shrutee Sarkar, editing by Larry King"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc co-founder Travis Kalanick, who was ousted as chief executive in June, is selling nearly a third of his 10 percent stake in the ride-services company for about $1.4 billion, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  Kalanick\u2019s sale is part of a deal struck by a consortium led by SoftBank Group Corp which is taking a 17.5 percent stake in Uber, mostly by buying shares from early investors and employees. SoftBank last week secured agreements from shareholders who were willing to sell, and the deal will close early this year, Uber said.  The SoftBank deal values Uber at $48 billion, about a 30 percent discount from its most recent valuation of $68 billion. However, the investor consortium is also making a $1.25 billion investment of fresh funding at the older, higher valuation.  Kalanick had offered to sell half of his total shares, but because there was a limit on how much SoftBank will buy, he will sell just 29 percent, according to the source. Other investors also did not get to unload as many shares as they had hoped because of such widespread interest to sell.  The former CEO owns 10 percent of the company, which means his sale will unload 2.9 percent of Uber shares and earn him about $1.4 billion, the source added.   A spokesman for Kalanick declined to comment. SoftBank and Uber could not be reached immediately for comment.  The sale would make the Uber co-founder a billionaire for the first time, not just on paper. Kalanick has never before sold shares of the company he ran for almost a decade, the source said.  The SoftBank deal offers investors and employees what could be their last chance to sell shares in a company-approved transaction before Uber\u2019s long awaited initial public offering, planned for 2019.     The transaction marks a victory for new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who helped broker the deal and who will benefit from a deep-pocketed investor like SoftBank.  Bloomberg first reported Kalanick\u2019s plans to sell part of his stake.  Reporting by Liana B.

The euro was 0.05 percent higher at $1.2074 after rising 0.45 percent overnight.  The common currency received its latest boost overnight as data showed the euro zone economy closed out 2017 with the strongest growth in nearly seven years.  The euro has been supported as U.S.-euro zone debt yield spreads have narrowed recently with the European Central Bank poised to curtail its massive stimulus programme and eventually join the Federal Reserve in normalising monetary policy.  The euro has gained 0.6 percent so far this week and a rise above $1.2092 would take it to its highest level since January 2015.  Weighed down by the greenback\u2019s weakness against the euro, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was poised on a loss of 0.3 percent this week.  It probed a three-month low of 91.751 on Tuesday and last stood at 91.838, headed for its third week of losses.  The U.S. currency\u2019s lack of traction was highlighted overnight as the dollar failed to draw support from stronger-than-expected jobs report. U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, data from ADP Research Institute showed, the biggest monthly increase since March.  The markets are now focused on Friday\u2019s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show job gains of 190,000 for December.  Given the dollar\u2019s recent poor showing, market participants reckon stronger-than-expected employment gains and growth in wages would be needed to turn fortunes around for the currency.  \u201cIt is the same theme from 2017 that is hurting the dollar, which is low inflation concerns, which in turn has capped Treasury yields,\u201d said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  \u201cThe euro, on the other hand, is on a roll. We see the euro zone HICP figures out later today and if that proves to be strong, that could offset a decent U.S. jobs report from the dollar\u2019s perspective,\u201d Ishikawa said.  The euro zone\u2019s harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) for December is due later on Friday.  \u201cThe euro looks solid at these levels. But if it were to gain further, it may have to brace for comments by officials concerned about the negative economic effects of a strong euro,\u201d said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  The common currency was near a 26-month high of 136.370 yen scaled overnight and on track for to gain 0.7 percent this week.  The Australian dollar extended gains from the previous day and rose to $0.7870, its highest since Oct. 20, before pulling back a little to $0.7854.  The Aussie was on track for its fourth straight week of gains, with the recent surge in prices of commodities like copper and iron ore providing a lift.  The Canadian dollar has also benefited from surging commodities, with crude oil prices at their highest since 2015.  The loonie was headed for its third straight week of gains, touching a 2-1/2-month high of C$1.2483 per dollar on Friday.  The yen was a laggard within the major currencies, having sunk this week against its peers like the dollar, euro and Aussie.  The Japanese currency depreciated against the broadly weaker greenback due to increasing investor appetite for risk in the broader markets, which dimmed its allure as a perceived safe haven.  The dollar was 0.1 percent higher at 112.830 yen, adding to modest gains from Thursday. It was little changed against the yen this week, during which it had momentarily slipped to a two-week low of 112.055.  Editing by Kim Coghill"

          "title": "Fitch Assigns Swire Properties' USD notes 'A' Rating",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, January 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Swire Properties Limited's (A/Stable) USD500 million 3.50% guaranteed notes due 2028 an 'A' rating. The notes are issued by Swire Properties MTN Financing Limited, a subsidiary of Swire Properties, under its USD4 billion medium-term note programme rated at 'A'. The notes are rated at the same level as Swire Properties' senior unsecured rating because they are guaranteed by the parent. The rating on Swire Properties reflects the delivery of stable rental income from its mature investment property portfolio, which provides strong investment-property EBITDA interest coverage ratios. The company has remained prudent regarding expansion in China, and demonstrated strong execution in boosting rental income in China. Its financial position remains solid, with healthy liquidity. KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Hong Kong Rentals: Swire Properties' gross rental income from its investment properties rose 0.5% in 2016, which resulted in a strong investment-property EBITDA interest coverage ratio of 6.0x. Gross rental income from Hong Kong remained stable at HKD8.6 billion in 2016 due to the moderate growth in office rents, which almost offset a slight decline in retail rental income. Swire Properties has a well-established Grade A office portfolio with an occupancy rate of 99% in 2016. The company also repositioned its tenant mix at the Pacific Place Mall in Hong Kong by introducing more food and beverage outlets and reducing the floor space for luxury items. Growth via Redevelopment: The redevelopment of the Taikoo Place commercial space into two Grade A office buildings will strengthen Swire Properties' leasing income in the medium to long term. The first new office building will be completed in 2018 and the second will be completed in 2021 or 2022. Redevelopment sites carry lower execution risks, and allow Swire Properties to tap resilient demand for office and other commercial space in existing well-developed areas. Rising Rentals outside Hong Kong: The growth of Swire Properties' attributable gross rental income in China in the near term will be driven by the shopping mall and office towers at its 50% owned HKRI Taikoo Hui in Shanghai. The shopping mall and one of the two office towers of the project were completed in 2016. Swire Properties is prudent in its expansion in China as it only invests in first-tier cities (for example, Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai) or second-tier cities with very strong potential (for example, Chengdu). In the USA, Swire Properties' 60.25% owned shopping mall at Brickell City Centre in Miami opened in 2016. Less Reliance on Parent's Funding: Swire Properties will continue to refinance its existing intercompany loans from Swire Pacific Limited (A-/Stable) with external funding sources. Borrowings from Swire Pacific have fallen to 20% of total borrowings at end-2016 from 74% at end-2011. This is neutral for Swire Properties' credit rating because Fitch expects the company's stable rental income streams will support its current credit profile. Adequate Interest Coverage: Fitch expects Swire Properties' recurring interest coverage (investment property EBITDA/gross interest expense) to stay above 4.5x in the next few years, due to additional rental income from newly completed properties. DERIVATION SUMMARY Swire Properties' rating of 'A' is well-positioned relative to peers such as Hongkong Land Holdings Limited (A/Stable) and Sun Hung Kai Properties Limited (SHKP, A/Stable). Its investment property EBITDA scale of about USD1 billion is between that of Hongkong Land (USD0.8 billion) and SHKP (USD1.7 billion). Its leverage, as defined by net debt/ investment property value, at 15%-16% is similar to peers, which are at 10%-20%. Its investment property EBITDA/cash interest coverage of 6x is also similar to the 5x-6x of its peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Total rental income growth at 2%, 2% and 4% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively (2016: 0.5%). - Operating EBITDA margin at 50%, 58% and 56% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively (2016: 55%). - Capex (including equity investment in JV companies) of HKD9 billion-10 billion in 2017, HKD3 billion-4 billion in 2018 and HKD2 billion-3 billion in 2019. (2016: HKD6.5 billion) - Net debt at HKD37 billion-40 billion in 2017-2019. (2016: HKD35.4 billion) RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Fitch does not envisage any positive rating action within the next 12-18 months, until Swire Properties' China investment portfolio reaches a critical mass, which would enable the company to achieve meaningful geographical diversification for its leasing income. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Investment property EBITDA/gross interest expense falls below 4.0x on a sustained basis (2016: 6.0x) - There is an aggressive expansion in China with heightened execution and financial risk - Material weakening of Swire Pacific's non-property business, which may require Swire Properties to increase its support to the group LIQUIDITY Ample Liquidity: Swire Properties had a cash balance of HKD1.7 billion, undrawn committed facilities of HKD8.5 billion and undrawn uncommitted facilities of HKD1.1 billion at end-2016, which is more than sufficient to cover its short-term debt of HKD7.5 billion. None of its debts is secured, which gives it flexibility in financing options.

          "body": "Tyler Bozak scored in the sixth round of the shootout, giving the Toronto Maple Leafs a 3-2 victory over the visiting San Jose Sharks on Thursday.  After Bozak scored, Chris Tierney tried to extend the shootout for the Sharks, but his shot banged off the post, allowing Toronto to stop its three-game losing streak.  Auston Matthews scored in the first round of the skills competition for the Maple Leafs, and Kevin Labanc of San Jose kept the shootout going with his third-round goal.  For San Jose, Joe Thornton needed two more points to pull even with Adam Oates for 17th on the all-time list at 1,420, but he did not notch any in the contest.  Toronto\u2019s Patrick Marleau opposed his former team for the second time this year. The 38-year old played with the Sharks for 19 seasons, ending with last year. He did not register a point Thursday.  The game started off with a bang when Thornton and Toronto\u2019s Nazem Kadri lined up for the opening faceoff and then dropped the gloves for a fight just two seconds in.  Kadri even managed to pull out a piece of Thornton\u2019s beard as they wrestled to the ice.  Matthews gave the Leafs a 1-0 lead with 1:23 left in the first period, deflecting a Connor Carrick shot past San Jose goalie Martin Jones.  The Sharks answered 31 seconds later when Brenden Dillon came in on the left side and beat goalie Frederik Andersen with a shot from the edge of the circle.  For Dillon, a defenseman, it was his first goal this season in game No. 37.  Toronto took a 2-1 lead when Kadri redirected a Mitchell Marner shot into the net on a power play with 7:20 remaining in the second period. The lead lasted a bit longer this time before San Jose tied it late in the period.  Andersen fumbled away a puck that came right to him after a faceoff at center ice. It went directly to Tierney, who scored on an unassisted goal with 1:42 left in the middle period.  Andersen finished with 33 saves, and Jones stopped 26 shots.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Nino Niederreiter needed just over one period to post his first hat trick of the season, and the Minnesota Wild rolled to a 6-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night in Saint Paul, Minn.  Mikko Koivu added a goal and two assists, and Daniel Winnik and Charlie Coyle scored the Wild\u2019s other goals.  Sam Reinhart and Evander Kane scored for Buffalo in the third period after Minnesota built a 6-0 lead.  Niederreiter came back to the team after missing the previous five games due to an ankle injury, and he made his mark quickly.  He scored 1:09 into the game, and his second goal of the period, at 13:53 on a power play, gave the Wild a 3-0 lead.  He completed the hat trick and made it 4-0 by scoring 4:02 into the second period from right in front. Niederreiter took a nice back pass from Mikael Granlund (three assists), getting the puck just outside the crease, and he buried it for his 13th goal of the season.  A bunch of fans threw hats on to the ice to celebrate the hat trick.  It was Niederreiter\u2019s second career hat trick, the other coming in 2014 and also against Buffalo.  The Wild (22-16-3) improved to 4-1-0 in the past five games and 11-1-1 in the past 13 at home. Minnesota, hurt by injuries many times this season, was able to field a full roster for the first time.  Minnesota built its lead to 6-0 in the second period and ended Buffalo goalie Robin Lehner\u2019s night after 40 minutes. Backup goalie Chad Johnson blanked the Wild in the final period, stopping all 10 shots he saw. Lehner made 11 saves while yielding six goals.  Wild goalie Devan Dubnyk finished with 29 saves in the victory.  Buffalo (10-21-9) wound up with a 31-27 edge in shots, but putting the puck into the net has been an issue for the Sabres of late. This was the 12th time in 17 games that the Sabres scored two goals or fewer. Buffalo fell to 1-2-2 in its last five games.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "DENVER (Reuters) - A man accused of fatally shooting three people at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic in 2015, who was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, can be forcibly medicated in an effort to restore him to competency, an appeals court ruled on Thursday.  The Colorado Court of Appeals upheld a lower court\u2019s ruling that the state can administer anti-psychotic drugs to Robert Lewis Dear, 59, over his lawyer\u2019s objections.  Dear\u2019s attorneys could not be reached for comment on whether they will appeal to the state supreme court. They previously have declined to make any statements about the case outside of court.  Dear was charged with multiple counts of murder and dozens of additional crimes stemming from the rampage at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs in November 2015.  The shooting left three dead, including a police officer from a nearby college who responded to the scene. Dear surrendered after a three-hour standoff with police.  In earlier courtroom outbursts, Dear said he was guilty and proclaimed himself \u201ca warrior for the babies,\u201d prompting Judge Gilbert Martinez, of Colorado\u2019s El Paso County Court, to order a mental evaluation.  Two state-appointed psychologists testified that Dear, a South Carolina native, suffers from a psychotic delusional disorder.  Martinez deemed Dear incompetent to stand trial. He has been held at the state mental hospital in Pueblo, where he has refused medications, court documents showed.  Prosecutors sought court permission to forcibly medicate Dear with Zyprexa, Abilify, Haldol and Cogentin, according to court papers.  Defense lawyers argued that the state failed to meet the legal requirements needed to involuntarily medicate Dear.  After a closed hearing, Judge Jill Mattoon, of Pueblo District Court, ruled that the state had the right to forcibly medicate Dear in an attempt to bring him to trial.  Dear\u2019s lawyers appealed her ruling, setting the stage for Thursday\u2019s opinion by a three-judge appellate panel.  The appeals court in its ruling noted that a U.S. Supreme Court decision allows the state \u201cto render a criminal defendant competent to stand trial\u201d if certain criteria are met.  \u201cBecause the (Supreme Court) test was met, we further conclude that the forced administration of antipsychotic medications to Dear is not an unconstitutional deprivation of his liberty,\u201d the judges ruled in their unanimous decision.  Under Colorado\u2019s criminal insanity statute, a defendant found unfit to stand trial must have the competency determination reviewed every 90 days.

          "body": "Stephen Curry scored 29 points and Klay Thompson added 28 as the Golden State Warriors recorded a 124-114 victory over the Houston Rockets on Thursday at Toyota Center in Houston.  The Warriors improved their NBA-best record to 31-8 and won their ninth consecutive road game despite the fact forward Kevin Durant sat out after suffering a strained right calf on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Rockets guard James Harden missed his second straight game with a partially torn hamstring and could miss the rest of the month.  Golden State forward Draymond Green had 17 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists for his 21st career triple-double, breaking the franchise mark set by Hall of Famer Tom Gola.  Eric Gordon scored 30 points for the Rockets (27-10), who dropped their seventh straight home game against Golden State. Gerald Green matched his career best of eight 3-pointers en route to a season-best 29-point outing, and Chris Paul added 28 points and nine assists.  The Rockets were a woeful 17-of-50 from 3-point range in a contest that was the 1,000th of Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s coaching career. His record is 537-463.  \u201cJust getting stops,\u201d Curry said of the key to the victory in a postgame interview on TNT. \u201cWe know Houston is an explosive team, and you can\u2019t get discouraged when Gerald Green and Eric Gordon are making shots.\u201d  Thompson\u2019s layup gave Golden State a 101-91 edge with 9:57 remaining. The Rockets were within 115-108 on Paul\u2019s 3-pointer with 3:39 left before the Warriors scored the next seven points to wrap up a victory that stretched the road winning streak to third longest in franchise history.  Gerald Green scored 13 points in the third quarter for the Rockets, who used an 11-0 spurt to take an 85-79 lead with 2:41 left in the period. But Golden State controlled the rest of the quarter, tying the score at 90 on Nick Young\u2019s 3-pointer with 37.6 seconds left and taking a 93-90 edge on Curry\u2019s 3 with 2.7 seconds remaining.  Gordon scored 17 and Paul added 15 as the Rockets held a 63-62 lead at the break.  Golden State finished the half with a 10-2 surge, capped by Thompson\u2019s 3-pointer with 5.4 seconds left. Thompson scored 15 and Curry added 14 in the half.  Gordon scored 13 first-quarter points as the Rockets held a 37-33 lead after the stanza.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Investors in\u00a0Chinese\u00a0bonds\u00a0should prepare for a nasty surprise in 2018. Beijing\u2019s tolerance for off-balance sheet municipal borrowing\u00a0has faded as debt levels have exploded.\u00a0In the name of\u00a0repricing risk, regulators will allow\u00a0the\u00a0once-unthinkable: a\u00a0big default\u00a0by a local government financing vehicle.  LGFVs\u00a0became popular\u00a0in China\u00a0during the global financial crisis.\u00a0The budget law\u00a0prevented localities from going directly into debt, but Beijing needed to stimulate quickly. With the connivance of the central\u00a0government, regional officials\u00a0created\u00a0thousands of\u00a0arms-length entities that could raise money to\u00a0goose\u00a0growth.  More than nine years have passed since Lehman Brothers collapsed, but these structures are still in business. They have around\u00a0$600 billion worth of bonds outstanding issued domestically over the last two years, Fitch estimates, equivalent to\u00a05 percent of GDP, but they keep running into trouble.\u00a0In April, troubled LGFV\u00a0Jiangsu NewHeadline Development\u00a0became the first to be\u00a0downgraded by an international ratings agency.   In 2014 Beijing\u00a0tried\u00a0to address the situation by revising the budget law\u00a0and launching a municipal bond market.\u00a0High-yielding\u00a0LGFV securities\u00a0were\u00a0to be\u00a0swapped\u00a0for\u00a0lower-yielding munis, easing debt service\u00a0costs and improving transparency.\u00a0Local government guarantees would be stripped from LGFV debt. Lacking\u00a0official\u00a0backing,\u00a0the vehicles were supposed to roll into the sunset.  As\u00a0the economy\u00a0started wobbling\u00a0in 2014 and into 2015, however,\u00a0officials softened.\u00a0LGFV liabilities\u00a0grew\u00a025 percent in 2015 and\u00a0the pace\u00a0remained above 20 percent going into\u00a02016,\u00a0the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0reported, citing\u00a0a confidential\u00a0World Bank study. They\u2019ve increasingly tapped offshore markets too. LGFV offshore bond issuance doubled to $12 billion in 2016, Reuters IFR reported, citing Moody\u2019s data.  But in 2017 debt leapt back into focus, and the government resumed its hard line. In May, six financial regulators joined hands to order local governments to stop issuing \u201cillegal guarantees.\u201d In December a central bank official publicly floated the idea of a local government default. The natural next step is allowing a\u00a0rickety entity\u00a0collapse and letting everyone watch investors lose money.  China\u2019s nervous\u00a0bond market,\u00a0where yields are already under pressure due to a campaign against shadow banking, will sell off on the news.\u00a0While Beijing is unlikely to tolerate an onshore rout, the same won\u2019t be true offshore.

          "title": "Trump credits his firmness for potential Korea talks, signals Olympic concession",
          "body": "WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called potential talks between North and South Korea \u201ca good thing\u201d and agreed with South Korea there would be no joint military drills, which North Korea bitterly opposes, during next month\u2019s Winter Olympics.  South Korea\u2019s Presidential Blue House said Trump told South Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-in in a telephone call he hoped inter-Korean talks would lead to good results and that he would send a high-level delegation, including members of his family, to the Winter Olympics, which will be held in South Korea.  A senior U.S. administration official told Reuters there had been discussion about Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka attending the games in Pyeongchang.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this but said Trump and Moon agreed \u201cto de-conflict the Olympics and our military exercises\u201d to ensure the security of the games and that a \u201chigh-level delegation\u201d would attend.  At the same time, the two leaders also \u201cagreed to continue the campaign of maximum pressure against North Korea,\u201d it added.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters the joint drills, which North Korea denounces as a prelude to invasion, would now take place sometime after the Olympics and Paralympics, which run from Feb. 9-25 and March 9-18. Mattis called their delay a \u201cpractical\u201d matter.  Mattis said it was too early to say if North Korea\u2019s offer to talk to South Korea was a genuine olive branch, but said it was clearly the result of international pressure.   In a tweet earlier, Trump, who hurled fresh insults at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this week, took credit for any dialogue.  \u201cDoes anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn\u2019t firm, strong and willing to commit our total \u2018might\u2019 against the North,\u201d Trump tweeted, adding that \u201ctalks are a good thing!\u201d  Washington had earlier responded coolly to Kim\u2019s suggestion of inter-Korean talks in a New Year\u2019s Day message, with the State Department saying Pyongyang \u201cmight be trying to drive a wedge\u201d between Washington and Seoul.  The head of U.S. forces in South Korea warned on Thursday against raising hopes over North Korea\u2019s overture amid a war of words over Pyongyang\u2019s development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.  Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim have exchanged bellicose comments in recent months, raising alarm across the world, with Trump at times dismissing the prospect of a diplomatic solution to a crisis in which both sides have threatened to destroy each other.  In his New Year address, Kim said he was open to dialogue with South Korea and could send a delegation to the Winter Olympics.  Kim also warned he would push ahead with \u201cmass producing\u201d nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions and warned that the entire United States was in range of North Korean nuclear missiles and a nuclear button was always on his desk.  Trump responded by mocking Kim as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and saying that his nuclear button was bigger and more powerful and worked.  Seoul answered the North Korean talks overture by proposing high-level talks at a border village next week and on Wednesday, the two Koreas reopened a border hotline that had been closed since February 2016.  The senior administration official said that despite Trump\u2019s positive words, there was concern in the administration that South Korea could go too far in offering concessions to North Korea that could weaken the U.S. pressure campaign.  \u201cI don\u2019t think people view the talks as an unalloyed good, that under all circumstances North and South talking is a good thing,\u201d the official said.  \u201cI think we have seen in the past that sometimes the North exploits these talks, especially when you have a left-of-center president in South Korea whose base is encouraging him to make concessions that we probably would not be comfortable with.\u201d  \u201cSo there\u2019s a level of wariness about that.\u201d  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said she understood any talks would be limited to the Olympics and domestic issues and added that Washington and Seoul were in close contact.  \u201cThis is not something where (South Korea) is going to go off freelancing,\u201d she said. \u201cCould that meeting that could potentially happen ... lead to something more in the future? Perhaps it could but I don\u2019t want to speculate.\u201d   On Tuesday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not contribute to denuclearizing North Korea.  She also said Washington was hearing reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile and warned of even tougher steps in response if it did so.  The commander of U.S. Forces Korea, General Vincent Brooks, said the North Korean overture was a strategy to divide five countries - the United States, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia - to reach its goal of being accepted as a \u201cnuclear capable\u201d nation, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency reported.  \u201cWe must keep our expectations at the appropriate level,\u201d he was quoted as saying in an address to a university in Seoul,\u201d he said, adding it was important for the United States and South Korea to maintain an \u201cironclad and razor-sharp\u201d alliance.  The five countries Brooks mentioned were involved in years of on-again-off-again \u201csix-party talks\u201d with North Korea aimed at resolving the crisis, but eventually North Korea pulled out.

          "title": "Fitch Rates Lai Fung's Proposed USD Senior Notes 'BB-(EXP)'",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, January 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Lai Fung Holdings Limited's (BB-/Stable) proposed US dollar senior notes a 'BB-(EXP)' expected rating. The notes are rated at the same level as Lai Fung's senior unsecured rating because they constitute its direct and senior unsecured obligations. The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received. Lai Fung's ratings are supported by its stable financial profile with investment-property (IP) EBITDA/gross interest ratio at 1.6x and total debt-to-total property asset at 33.5% at 31 July 2017, both similar to levels a year earlier. Furthermore, Fitch expects Lai Fung's IP EBITDA interest cover to remain above 1x due to its new Guangzhou Lai Fung Tower's first full year of contribution to rental income in the financial year ended 31 July 2017 (FY17). The Chinese property company's ratings are constrained by its small IP EBITDA of around USD60 million, material exposure to development properties and the large amount of investment property under development with a gross floor area of 3.6 million square feet (sq ft) compared with the current 3.2 million sq ft of completed investment property in operation. KEY RATING DRIVERS Prudent Financial Management: Lai Fung has maintained neutral to positive operating cash flow by focusing on generating a healthy profit margin in its development-property business to support the development of new investment properties between 2011 and 2017. Lai Fung's leverage, as measured by total debt/total property assets, remained less than 30% after it peaked in FY13, as it raised funds in the equity market and maintained stable cash flows from property sales. Between FY15 and FY17, the gross floor area (GFA) of development property projects available for sale fell to around 2 million sq ft (excluding joint-venture projects) from 5.9 million sq ft. Hengqin Project Long-Term Positive: The Hengqin Novotown project will become an important source of recurring income after completion in 1HFY19 and will likely push total IP EBITDA above HKD600 million when the project matures after FY20. The sale of cultural-themed properties may generate sales of about HKD1 billion to support the development of this project from FY18. We expect the development of this project to increase Lai Fung's leverage to above 30% in the short to medium term, but leverage will still be below the threshold where Fitch could consider negative rating action. Lai Fung will need to spend another HKD2 billion in Phase 1 of the project, which is on track. Construction started in 2HFY15 and the company has signed license agreements that cover about 60% of the project's culture and hospitality-themed GFA of around 1.5 million sq ft. Reducing Concentration of Rental Income: Fitch expects Shanghai Hong Kong Plaza, Lai Fung's flagship investment property, to account for less than 50% of the company's rental revenue by FY19, from about 60% currently. The decline will result from the addition of new investment properties. We expect Lai Fung's mature investment properties to have rental growth in the mid- to low-single digits and achieve a stable EBITDA margin of around 62%. Its already-high occupancy of above 95% for most of its key office and retail properties means that further rental revenue upside will mainly be driven by positive rental reversion. Lower Contribution from Residential Projects: Lai Fung's sales of development properties will be mainly driven by the Palm Spring project in Zhongshan city in Guangdong province. Lai Fung's gross profit margin for development property has been above 40% since FY09, except for FY11, and we expect this margin to be sustained in the next two to three years, underpinned by the stable or rising selling price of the Palm Spring project. Lai Fung's 3.5 million sq ft of saleable GFA of development properties will last until FY21 or FY22 based on the current construction schedule. We have assumed in our analysis that Lai Fung will acquire development-property projects every two to three years. DERIVATION SUMMARY Lai Fung's shopping malls and offices enjoyed healthy occupancy of over 90% and high single-digit rental rate growth. Its IP EBITDA/gross interest cover has been above 1.2x; setting it apart from most Chinese homebuilders that rely on more risky development-property sales to service their debts. Lai Fung has a significantly stronger financial profile than Golden Wheel Tiandi Holdings Company Limited (GWTH, B/Stable), which is also focused on investment properties. GWTH's IP EBITDA/gross interest coverage was only 0.5x at end-2016, lower than Lai Fung's 1.6x. Lai Fung's leverage is also lower than 'BB' rating category peers' leverage of between 30% and 40%. Lai Fung's small IP EBITDA of around USD60 million in FY17 and material exposure to development property risks constrain its ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Replenishes development-property land bank over a three-year sales cycle - Mid- to low-single-digit rental rate growth - IP GFA growth according to management guidance as per interim report - Capex and dividend for FY17 and FY18 similar to FY16 level - Hong Kong dollar at 1.15 to Chinese yuan over FY17-FY19 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - Annual EBITDA from investment properties rising above HKD600 million (FY16: HKD381 million, FY17: HKD549 million) and EBITDA from investment properties/interest expenses exceeding 1.5x on a sustained basis (FY16: 1.3x, FY17: 1.6x) Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - EBITDA from investment properties/interest expenses falling below 1.0x on a sustained basis, or - Total debt/property assets exceeding 40% on a sustained basis (FY16: 28.9%, FY17: 33.5%) LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity: Lai Fung has maintained enough cash to cover its short-term debt expiring in the past. It had approximately HKD2 billion of cash on hand and undrawn credit facilities of HKD3.7 billion at 30 November 2017, which were sufficient to meet its short-term bank loans of HKD18 million and offshore yuan-denominated senior notes of CNY1.8 billion due April 2018. Lai Fung's growing recurring EBITDA of over HKD400 million will also provide steady cash flow to support its debt servicing.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China slightly trimmed its final 2016 gross domestic product figure after scaling back an initial estimate of the services sector, but kept the annual GDP growth rate unchanged at 6.7 percent, the statistics bureau said on Friday.

The sector, which accounts for half of China\u2019s GDP, expanded 7.8 percent in the bureau\u2019s initial estimate to 38.4 trillion yuan.

          "body": "Jeff Skinner\u2019s unassisted goal in the second period snapped a scoreless tie Thursday night, as the Carolina Hurricanes bounced back from consecutive one-goal losses with a 4-0 blanking of the Pittsburgh Penguins at PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh.  It was the fifth win in seven games for Carolina (19-13-8), which is now holding down the eighth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference after a slow start. The Penguins dropped to 20-19-3 and continued their inconsistent form.  Skinner took the puck away and potted his 13th marker of the season at 6:50 for the only goal the Hurricanes required. But they kept adding on to make things easier for goalie Cam Ward.  Teuvo Teravainen notched his 11th goal at 16:53 to make it 2-0, with Sebastian Aho and Jaccob Slavin drawing assists. For Aho, it was his 20th helper of the season.  Aho sealed the result in the third period with a pair of goals. With Jordan Staal and Brett Pesce helping out, Aho scored at 9:14 for a three-goal cushion. At 12:33, Aho tallied his 13th of the season, with Teravainen and Pesce bagging assists.  Ward (11-2-2), who\u2019s wrested the starting job from offseason signee Scott Darling, made 21 saves for his first shutout of the season.  Pittsburgh goalie Matt Murray (14-12-1) stopped 29 of 33 shots in the losing cause. The Penguins have lost eight of their last 12 matches.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Ivan Provorov scored two goals, and the Philadelphia Flyers defeated the visiting New York Islanders 6-4 Thursday night at the Wells Fargo Center.  Sean Couturier, Michael Raffl, Wayne Simmonds and Travis Konecny also scored for the Flyers (17-15-8). It was a huge response following a disappointing 5-1 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday, which was Philadelphia\u2019s fourth loss in five games.  Cal Clutterbuck scored a pair of goals while John Tavares and Ryan Pulock added a goal each for the Islanders (20-17-4). New York, which gave up three goals in the third period in its previous last loss to the Boston Bruins, has dropped four games in a row.  Dennis Seidenberg earned assists on each of Clutterbuck\u2019s two goals. Nick Leddy also had two assists for New York.  Claude Giroux and Jakub Voracek each notched two assists for the Flyers, and Provorov had an assist for a three-point game.  The game was tied at 1 after the first period.  The wild second period featured five goals \u2014 four of them by the Flyers.  Provorov\u2019s first goal gave the Flyers a 4-1 advantage with 13:36 remaining in the middle period. The tally was made possible because New York\u2019s Tanner Fritz received a four-minute double minor for high-sticking Philadelphia\u2019s Andrew MacDonald.  However, the Flyers have had trouble holding onto leads all season, and the Islanders got within 4-2 when Clutterbuck scored his second goal of the game with 7:34 left in the second period.  Konecny responded for the Flyers and snapped a nine-game drought without scoring by restoring a three-goal advantage 3 1/2 minutes later.  The Islanders have allowed 55 goals in the second period this season, the most of any team in the league.  Tavares fired a wrist shot into the net for a power-play goal with 13:58 remaining in the third to close the Islanders within 5-3. It was Tavares\u2019 22nd goal of the season.  Pulock made the game quite interesting with an unassisted goal with 5:25 left for a one-goal deficit.  The Islanders pulled goaltender Thomas Griess with about 1:30 left, and it resulted in a flurry of chances.  Philadelphia managed to hold on for the victory after Provorov\u2019s empty-net goal in the waning seconds.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "title": "Fitch Upgrades Longfor to 'BBB'; Outlook Stable",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG/BEIJING, January 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded China-based Longfor Properties Co. Ltd.'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), senior unsecured rating and the ratings on its outstanding notes to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'. The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. The upgrade follows Longfor's improving business profile, continued financial stability and established operational record. Longfor became a top-10 domestic player in 2017 by contracted sales with diversification across more than 31 Tier 1, 2 and 3 cities (based on land bank) and clear home buyer product segmentation. We expect Longfor to continue increasing its recurring rental income from investment properties (IP), including shopping malls and rental apartments. Our forecast of Longfor's recurring EBITDA/gross interest will trend higher to 0.7x by 2019, from 0.49x in 2016; a highly defensive quality among investment-grade peers in China's homebuilding space. Longfor's business profile has improved without compromising its leverage, which Fitch sees as evidence of a well-implemented growth strategy. Longfor's falling funding costs, to levels similar to even 'BBB+' grade peers, has also increased its financial flexibility. KEY RATING DRIVERS Established and Diversified Homebuilder: Longfor has built a diversified pan-China homebuilding business that covers more than 31 Tier 1, 2 and 3 cities (based on land bank) as well as clear home buyer product segmentation. The company has a firm foothold in western China, with a strong brand name in cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu. It had 50 million square metres (sq m) of gross land bank with an estimated land reserve life of five years at end-June 2017, with the Pan-Bohai Rim region accounting for 39% and western China 27%. Longfor generated strong sales growth of 85% in 11M17 with higher average selling price (ASP) of CNY15,247 per sq m, up 6% from 2016, despite its exposure to higher-tier cities that face stringent home purchase restriction policies. The company's move to replenish its land bank before the jump in land prices in 2016 has supported contracted sales growth and improved profitability. Fitch expects Longfor's sales growth to slow to 16% in 2018 because of the continued home purchase restrictions. The company's healthy land bank will allow it to slow land acquisitions and this will result in an improving financial profile if sales growth slows dramatically due to further policy tightening. Recurring Rental Income Foundation: Fitch expects Longfor to continue generating positive cash flow from operations (CFO) in 2017 and 2018, extending a trend that started in 2012. Longfor plans to aggressively expand its IP portfolio to boost recurring income in the long term using strong cash flow generation from its homebuilding business. It had 26 malls in operation in 2017, which had a 96% occupancy rate and generated gross rental income of CNY1.1 billion in 1H17 (last 12 months gross rental yield at cost: 6%). It plans to have more than 40 malls by end-2020. Longfor's rental apartment business launched in 1H17 and generated gross rental income of CNY3 million. Longfor aims to increase this to over CNY2 billion per year by 2020 through the operation of 100,000 rooms. Strong Operational Profile: We expect Longfor's operational profile to continue strengthening. Gross contracted sales amounted to CNY148 billion in first eleven months of 2017 (2016: CNY88 billion, 2015: CNY54 billion), significantly above Fitch's forecast. We expect Longfor's recurring gross rental income to rise by roughly 30% in 2017F to around CNY2.5 billion as new shopping malls start to ramp-up and we see positive rental reversion for Longfor's older shopping malls. Total contracted sales/total debt should jump to 2.0x in 2017, from 1.5x in 2016, and remain at that level for 2018F-2019F, indicating high churn compared with some similarly rated peers. Healthy Financial Position: Fitch expects Longfor's leverage - as measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, including IP valued at higher of cost or 5% yield - to be roughly 31% in 2017F, increasing to 33% in 2018F and 36% in 2019F. The higher leverage is likely to come from increased IP investments to boost long-term recurring income. Longfor's property development business scale has expanded substantially, requiring a larger working capital base. We believe the higher leverage should be manageable as Longfor has previously shown strong leverage discipline and management plans to control leverage, for example, by destocking inventory rather than acquiring more land. In addition, we believe higher leverage is the natural course of business during the expansion phase, as evidenced by the almost doubling of contracted sales yoy in 2017. We expect IP capex to peak in 2019 and for Longfor to deleverage from 2020. Room to Further Deleverage: Longfor's shopping malls are specifically targeted at China's middle class. With China's expanding economy and growing middle class, there are opportunities for positive rental reversions for its malls (mostly located in Tier 1 cities), which could lead to an increase in the fair value of Longfor's IP assets as assessed by an independent third party based on present and forecast rental yields. An increase in the value of its IP portfolio would increase the asset base supporting its indebtedness and result in a lower leverage. Low-Cost Funding Access: Longfor has ready access to diversified funding sources, including domestic and offshore bond markets and banks with its average cost of borrowing falling to 4.7% in 1H17, from 6.7% in 2012. Fitch expects Longfor's interest costs to remain low, as management is focused on maintaining ample liquidity, which helps support its ratings. Longfor recently issued five-year senior notes of USD450 million in the international capital market at a coupon rate of 3.875% per annum in July 2017. Coverage ratios, including recurring EBITDA/gross interest, are likely to further improve if Longfor's average funding costs continue to trend down. DERIVATION SUMMARY Fitch upgraded Longfor's IDR to reflect its strong operational performance, with contracted sales reaching critical mass, rising recurring income from IP and a healthy financial profile. Longfor has had stable and positive CFO since 2012 and we expect continued positive CFO, which in turn will support the gradual expansion of its homebuilding and IP businesses. We have compared Longfor to large-scale homebuilding peers rated 'BBB-' (Shimao Property Holdings Limited and Country Garden Holdings Co. Ltd.) and 'BBB+' (China Vanke Co., Ltd., China Resources Land Ltd (CR Land) and Poly Real Estate Group Company Limited). Poly's standalone credit profile is assessed at 'BBB'. We believe the one-notch difference against the 'BBB+' category peers is justified, as Longfor has higher leverage, as measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, than Vanke and CR Land, but lower leverage than Poly. Longfor has stronger recurring EBITDA/gross interest than Vanke, though its ratio is comparable with that of Poly and weaker than that of CR Land. Longfor's EBITDA margins are similar to that of Poly, but stronger than those of Vanke and CR Land. Vanke has stronger sales efficiency than Longfor, while that of CR Land and Poly are weaker. We also believe the one-notch difference against the 'BBB-' peers is justified as Longfor has stronger recurring EBITDA/gross interest than both peers, while its EBITDA margin is higher than that of Country Garden and comparable with that of Shimao. Longfor's leverage is higher than that of both peers, but its sales efficiency is stronger than that of Shimao and comparable with that of Country Garden. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Gross contracted sales to increase by 16% yoy in 2018 and 2019 (2016: 62%, 2017: 76%) - EBITDA margin of around 23%-27% in 2018-2019 (2016: 23%, 2017 estimate: 28.7%) - IP income from shopping malls to reach CNY3.2 billion in 2018 and CNY4.2 billion in 2019 - IP income from rental apartments to reach CNY0.6 billion in 2018 and CNY1.2 billion in 2019 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Net debt/adjusted inventory (investment property valued at higher of cost or 5% yield) sustained below 30% - IP expanding in scale to generate substantially higher recurring income Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Net debt/adjusted inventory (investment property valued at higher of cost or 5% yield) above 40% for a sustained period - Contracted sales/total debt below 1.5x for a sustained period - EBITDA margin below 22% for a sustained period - Weakening of cash flow from operations for a sustained period LIQUIDITY Diversified Funding Sources: Longfor has diversified funding channels, including offshore and onshore bonds, offshore and onshore bank loans and funds. The funding sources help lower refinancing risk and provide capital to operate the business when market liquidity is tight. Longfor has established long-term strategic relationships with onshore and offshore banks. Sufficient Liquidity: Longfor had CNY22.6 billion of cash at end-June 2017, sufficient to cover short-term debt of CNY7.7 billion. The company has made opportunistic early repayments for most of its US dollar debt financing. Fitch expects the group to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund development costs, land premium payments and debt obligations during 2018-2019 due to its diversified funding channels and flexible land acquisition strategy.

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China\u2019s heavily polluted industrial province of Hebei has pledged to cut concentrations of hazardous smog particles by 14 percent by 2020, part of China\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve air quality in the region.  Following a meeting this week, the provincial government promised to cut small, airborne particles known as PM2.5 to an average of 57 micrograms per cubic metre by 2020, down from 65 micrograms in 2017, according to a notice issued by the local environmental bureau on Thursday.  Smog-prone Hebei, which surrounds the capital Beijing, is a major front in China\u2019s ongoing \u201cwar on pollution\u201d, and it is desperate to promote cleaner forms of growth and cut fossil fuel use, especially coal.  The province has been under heavy pressure to bring smog under control this winter, shutting factories, curbing traffic and converting coal-fired heating boilers as part of a state anti-pollution drive that committed 28 northern Chinese cities to reduce PM2.5 concentrations by at least 15 percent from October 2017 to March 2018.             Hebei - China\u2019s biggest steel-producing region - also said this week that it would accelerate efforts to restructure its heavy industrial economy, promote innovation, expand tourism and service sectors and increase forestation in the next three years.  The province aims to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total primary energy mix to 10 percent by 2020, up from 5 percent in 2015 - still falling short of the national target of 15 percent for the period.

          "body": "Redshirt junior forward Keita Bates-Diop continued to make up for lost time, producing a career-high-tying 27 points as well as 13 rebounds to guide Ohio State to a 92-81 Big Ten victory over Iowa on Thursday night at Carver-Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, Iowa.  On the first Thursday of January 2017, then-Ohio State coach Thad Matta revealed Bates-Diop would miss the rest of the season with a stress fracture in his leg.  On the first Thursday of January 2018, Bates-Diop delivered his seventh double-double of the season that featured an eight-point scoring run in the second half to fend off Iowa\u2019s most serious rally of the night.  All five starters reached double figures for the Buckeyes (12-4, 3-0 Big Ten). Senior forward Jae\u2019Sean Tate scored 18 points and senior shooting guard Kam Williams added 13 as Ohio State and new head coach Chris Holtmann remained one of three unbeaten teams in Big Ten play.  Iowa (9-8, 0-4) already has dropped three conference home games.  The Hawkeyes placed four players in double figures. Sophomore power forward Tyler Cook shrugged off early foul trouble to finish with 21 points and nine rebounds. Sophomore guard Jordan Bohannon notched 15 points and a season-high 10 assists while freshman center Luke Garza scored 15 points.  Nicholas Baer added 10 points for Iowa.  Ohio State set the tone immediately by drilling six of its first seven shots to take a 14-12 lead. Junior point guard C.J. Jackson handed out three assists as the Buckeyes\u2019 other four starters each hit at least one shot.  Williams, who tried just two 3-pointers in Ohio State\u2019s first two Big Ten games, maintained the hottest hand early as he drilled three treys in the opening nine minutes to stake the Buckeyes to a 28-16 lead.  Iowa tried to force Ohio State out of its rhythm in the second half with a variety of traps and presses. The Hawkeyes scored the first nine points of the half \u2014 capped by Garza\u2019s three-point play at the 17:10 mark \u2014 to slash Ohio State\u2019s lead to 46-41.  However, Tate wriggled free for a layup on the Buckeyes\u2019 next possession to trigger a 12-2 spree. Bates-Diop scored eight straight during that run in a variety of ways \u2014 a 15-foot pullup at the shot-clock buzzer, two free throws, a driving layup and a 15-foot fadeaway jumper \u2014 to restore order.  Iowa couldn\u2019t get any closer than nine points the rest of the way.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Serena Williams reluctantly pulled out of this year\u2019s Australian Open on Friday, the American saying that while she was close to regaining full fitness after giving birth to her first child in September, she was not fully ready to defend her title.  The 36-year-old was eight weeks pregnant last year when she triumphed for a seventh time at Melbourne Park to claim an Open-era record 23rd grand slam title and then took the rest of the year off before giving birth to a daughter.  She has played just once in public since, losing to French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in Abu Dhabi last week, but was still hopeful of making a remarkable return at the Australian Open until she admitted defeat a week ahead of the event.  \u201cMy coach and team always said \u2018only go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the way\u2019. I can compete - but I don\u2019t want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time,\u201d Williams said in a statement.  Williams had told Vogue magazine last August about her \u201coutrageous plan\u201d to defend her title but the short turnaround after giving birth has proven too much for even the greatest player of her generation.  Williams, whose grand slam tally is just one shy of the all-time record held by Australian Margaret Court, said she was disappointed to withdraw but looked forward to returning in the future.  \u201cAfter competing in Abu Dhabi I realised that although I am super close, I\u2019m not where I personally want to be,\u201d Williams added.  \u201cWith that being said, and even though I am disappointed about it, I\u2019ve decided not to compete in the Australian Open this year.\u201d  Tournament director Craig Tiley called Williams\u2019 efforts to try and be ready for a title defence at the Australian Open \u201cHerculean\u201d and said she transcended the sport.  \u201cIt was never going to be good enough for her to just compete, she wants to give herself the best chance to win,\u201d Tiley said.   \u201cI\u2019ve been in constant contact with Serena and her team and know this is why she has pushed it and pushed it until the eleventh hour to make her final decision.\u201d  Williams is the latest big name to withdraw from the year\u2019s opening grand slam, which will be played from Jan. 15-28, with Britain\u2019s Andy Murray (hip) and Japan\u2019s Kei Nishikori (wrist) having already said they would not compete.  There is also uncertainty over whether former champions Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka and Rafa Nadal, the latter of which arrived in Melbourne earlier on Friday, will be fit to take to the court.

          "body": "HAVANA (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s top diplomat Federica Mogherini met Cuban President Raul Castro on Thursday as she ended a two-day visit to the Communist country aimed at strengthening engagement even as the Trump administration backtracks on a fragile detente.  Cuban state-run television broadcast footage of the meeting and said it covered the favorable state of relations between the EU and Havana and international issues.  At a press conference earlier in the day, Mogherini said that EU member countries combined were now Cuba\u2019s most important economic partner and announced a series of agreements.  As the U.S.-Cuba rapprochement unfolded in 2015-2016 the EU dropped all sanctions and negotiated a political dialogue and cooperation agreement, the first between Cuba and the EU.  Mogherini told journalists before meeting Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Thursday morning that the agreement also provided new potential in trade and investment.  \u201cThe EU has become Cuba\u2019s first trade partner and was already the first in investment and development cooperation ... which means it is possible to increase the level of economic relations and investments,\u201d she said before meeting Castro.  Mogherini said a delegation from the European Investment Bank would visit Cuba later this month.  She said cooperation agreements in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, culture and expertise valued at 49 million euros ($59.1 million) would be signed shortly.  In February, Mogherini will preside with Rodriguez in Brussels over the first joint cooperation meeting between the EU and Cuba, she said.  During her visit she repeatedly criticized the U.S. trade embargo and said she regretted \u201cthat the current U.S. administration has apparently changed course with Cuba.\u201d  Diplomats said the EU appeared to sense an opportunity, with Castro expected to retire in April and market-oriented reforms already underway.  \u201cI believe that Europe has the potential and interest to take an independent agenda in Cuba in economic and political matters for strategic purposes,\u201d said a senior Latin American diplomat.  \u201cCuba does not cost so much and is very symbolic worldwide. At the same time it balances the growing Russian and Chinese influence,\u201d the diplomat said.  Richard Feinberg, an economist and expert on Latin America and Cuba at the Brookings Institution, said Cuban commerce is so spread around the world today that no single country accounts for more than 20 percent of its total trade.

          "body": "* Brent has risen by more than 10 pct since December  * Oil has been supported by OPEC-led cuts, strong economic growth  * Tensions in OPEC-member Iran have also lifted oil prices  * But soaring U.S. crude production could undermine rally  By Henning Gloystein  SINGAPORE, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices held firm on Friday, with Brent crude up by more than 10 percent from its December lows on the back of political tensions in OPEC-member Iran and a tightening U.S. market.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.95 a barrel at 0151 GMT, 5 cents below their last close but not far off the $62.21 May 2015 high reached the previous day.  Brent crude futures were at $68.03 a barrel, 4 cents below their last settlement, but not far off the $68.27 high from the day before, also the highest since May 2015.  Beyond a brief intraday spike in May 2015, these were the highest price levels since December 2014, during the oil price downturn.  Traders said political tensions in oil producing Iran were supporting prices.  \u201cThe protests in Iran add more fuel to the already bullish oil market mood,\u201d said Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss Bank Julius Baer.  Oil prices have been supported by production cuts led by the Middle East dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and by Russia, which started in January last year and are set to last through 2018, as well as by strong economic growth and financial markets.  This has helped tighten markets. U.S. Commercial crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA fell by 7.4 million barrels in the week to Dec. 29, to 424.46 million barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).  That\u2019s down 20 percent from their historic peaks last March and close to the five-year average of 420 million barrels.  CAN THE BULL-RUN LAST?  Given that Iran\u2019s oil production has not been affected by the unrest, and that U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA will likely break through 10 million barrels per day (bpd) soon, a level so far only reached by Saudi Arabia and Russia, doubts are emerging whether the bull-run can last.  \u201cPrices above $60 per barrel project an overly rosy picture, so we see near-term downside,\u201d Ruecker warned.  \u201cOil production disruptions (in Iran) remain a very distant threat ... Disruptions in the North Sea have been removed with the Forties Pipeline system having resumed full operations. U.S. oil production surpassed the 2015 highs in October and is set to climb to historic highs this year,\u201d he said.  Lukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM, struck a similarly cautious tone.  \u201cOil started the New Year on an incredibly bullish note ... in part due to ongoing tensions in Iran ... (and) over OPEC\u2019s supply cut rebalancing the markets,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhile the current momentum suggests that further upside is on the cards, it must be kept in mind that U.S. shale remains a threat to higher oil prices.\u201d  Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Richard Pullin"

Leigh Corfman\u2019s lawsuit, filed in Alabama\u2019s Montgomery County Circuit Court, cited negative attacks by Moore and his supporters after she made her accusations. The lawsuit, seen by Reuters, seeks a judgment of defamation, a public apology, and  legal costs.  \u201cBy this lawsuit, I seek to do what I could not do as a 14-year-old \u2014 hold Mr. Moore and those who enable him accountable,\u201d Corfman said in a statement that was emailed by her attorneys.   Moore, Alabama\u2019s former chief judge, has denied the allegations, calling them \u201ccompletely false and a desperate political attack.\u201d [nL1N1NF2I7]     Representatives of his campaign could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.  Moore, a Republican known for staunchly conservative views, was defeated in Alabama\u2019s special election for the U.S. Senate last month. Doug Jones became the first Democrat sent to the Senate from Republican stronghold Alabama in a quarter century. [nL1N1OE2H8]  Moore was a controversial candidate whose campaign was beset by allegations that he sexually assaulted or pursued teenage girls while he was in his 30s. He denied the misconduct allegations, saying they were a result of \u201cdirty politics.\u201d  Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.  Corfman\u2019s allegations came more than a month before the special election for the U.S. Senate seat on Dec. 12.  [nL1N1OE2H8]  In a Washington Post article on Nov. 9, Corfman and three other women accused Moore of pursuing them when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s. Corfman alleged that she met Moore as a young teen in 1979 and that he sexually touched her.  In the lawsuit, Corfman accused Moore and his campaign of repeatedly calling her a liar at rallies and in the media, and questioning her motivation for publicly disclosing her allegations.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The administration of President Donald Trump plans to delay until 2020 enforcement of a federal rule that requires communities to assess racial segregation in housing and offer plans to correct it, The New York Times reported on Thursday.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will publish the change in a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Friday, the newspaper reported.  The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   The change does not end the rule, a condition of receiving billions of dollars in grants and housing aid, but is intended to allow time for more help for communities that have had trouble completing the analyses and solutions, HUD said in a statement to the Times.  Following a review of its rules and regulations and requests for public comment, HUD said: \u201cWhat we heard convinced us that the Assessment of Fair Housing tool for local governments wasn\u2019t working well,\u201d the newspaper reported.  The notice tells cities working on plans called for under the 2015 rule that they will not have to submit them, and HUD said it will stop reviewing plans that have already been filed, according to the Times.  Critics of the move say it would effectively halt the first major effort in decades to address racial inequality in housing, the Times reported.  The move would be the latest in a series by the Republican Trump administration to roll back or delay initiatives undertaken during the administration of Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama.

          "title": "After attacks by Trump, Bannon finds himself with few friends",
          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Following his brutal disavowal by President Donald Trump, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s dream of spearheading a new U.S. political movement appears in tatters while the Republican establishment he challenged is feeling more secure.  Trump turned on Bannon over his comments to the author of a book highly critical of the president and his family. The White House followed up on Thursday by suggesting that Bannon be ousted from his influential perch as chief executive of the hard-right news site Breitbart News.  Bannon appeared to have few close friends left among the more conservative factions of the Republican Party, which swiftly proclaimed their loyalty to Trump following the breakup.  \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone in the conservative movement that\u2019s supporting Steve over Donald Trump right now in this,\u201d Christopher Ruddy, a close Trump ally and chief executive of the conservative Newsmax site, told Reuters.  Mike Cernovich, a leading social-media voice of the so-called alt-right movement that Bannon helped energize on Trump\u2019s behalf, had no doubt about which of the two men had more popular support. \u201cThe base will stay with Trump.\u201d  Reader comments on Breitbart\u2019s site seemed overwhelmingly supportive of the president compared with Bannon. The Wall Street Journal reported late on Thursday that the site\u2019s board was considering letting him go.  Bannon\u2019s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.  Last year, media outlets as diverse as Time magazine and the comedy show \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d portrayed Bannon, Trump\u2019s election campaign strategist, as the power behind the president, an unshaven, shabbily dressed Svengali bending the Republican Party to his economic nationalist agenda.  But Bannon\u2019s star had been tumbling long before this week\u2019s flap over criticism Bannon leveled at Trump\u2019s family in Michael Wolff\u2019s new book on the White House.  In August, Bannon was fired amid a power struggle in the West Wing, forcing his return to Breitbart.  His reputation as a political mastermind then took a hit after Republicans lost a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama they had long held when the Bannon-backed Roy Moore, who was accused of improper conduct with teenage girls, fell to Democrat Doug Jones.  After leaving the White House, Bannon proclaimed his loyalty to Trump and vowed to wage an insurrection against the Republican establishment, especially Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom he accused of stalling Trump\u2019s policy agenda.  But last month, on the heels of Moore\u2019s loss in Alabama, McConnell helped steer an overhaul of the U.S. tax code through Congress, earning praise from Trump and depriving Bannon of his argument that the Republican-controlled Congress had not produced results.  Trump turned on Bannon on Wednesday, saying he had \u201clost his mind\u201d when he lost his job as chief strategist. He said Bannon did not represent Trump\u2019s political base and had exaggerated his influence even when he was at the White House.  Following Trump\u2019s attack, some of the candidates who had aligned themselves with Bannon\u2019s movement began stepping away, including Arizona U.S. Senate hopeful Kelli Ward and New York congressional candidate Michael Grimm, who called the attacks against Trump\u2019s family \u201cbaseless.\u201d  Bannon\u2019s influence, Ruddy said, had always stemmed from the belief that he was close to Trump.  \u201cHe\u2019s greatly diminished,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Steve forgets is the base is all about Donald Trump. It\u2019s not about Steve Bannon.\u201d  Josh Holmes, a former top aide to McConnell, said Bannon had been on a \u201cself-interested mission\u201d to play kingmaker inside the Republican Party.  \u201cI think that\u2019s over. ... A leader without followers is just a guy taking a walk,\u201d Holmes said.  A friend of Bannon, former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg, said he doubted Bannon\u2019s relationship with Trump could be fully repaired. But he added that Bannon would retain some sway over Trump\u2019s supporters, particularly on issues such as immigration.  \u201cThis is not the end of the world, particularly with this president,\u201d Nunberg said.  Trump is known for casting associates out of the fold, but also for bringing them back, particularly if there are common political interests or common enemies.  The president did appear to be in a slightly forgiving mood on Thursday, noting that Bannon had praised him the night before on a radio show.  \u201cI don\u2019t know, he called me a great man last night,\u201d Trump told reporters, \u201cso you know, he obviously changed his tune pretty quick.\u201d  Reporting by James Oliphant and Jeff Mason; Additional\nreporting by John Whitesides; Written by James Oliphant; Editing\nby Kieran Murray and Peter Cooney"

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will plant new forests covering an area roughly the size of Ireland this year as it aims to increase forest coverage to 23 percent of its total landmass by the end of the decade, China Daily reported on Friday.  Planting trees has become a key part of China\u2019s efforts to improve its environment and tackle climate change, and the government has pledged to raise total coverage from 21.7 percent to 23 percent over the 2016-2020 period, said the China Daily, citing the country\u2019s top forestry official.  Zhang Jianlong, head of the State Forestry Administration, said at a meeting on Thursday that China would aim to grow at least 6.66 million hectares of new forest this year.  He said 33.8 million hectares of forest had been planted nationwide over the last five years, with a total investment of more than 538 billion yuan ($82.88 billion), bringing the country\u2019s total forest area to 208 million hectares.  Three new state forests with a total area of 483,000 hectares would also be built in the new Xiongan development zone in Hebei province, he said.  The heavily polluted Hebei, which surrounds the capital Beijing, has also pledged to raise total forest coverage to 35 percent by the end of 2020.  China, which has to feed a quarter of the global population using just 7 percent of the world\u2019s arable land, has long struggled to strike a balance between industrial growth, maximizing food production and protecting its environment.   The government is currently promoting an \u201cecological red line\u201d program which will force provinces and regions to restrict \u201cirrational development\u201d and curb construction near rivers, forests and national parks.   The environment ministry said last month that 15 provinces had already drawn up plans, with the remaining 16 aiming to do so this year, but it is not yet clear what impact the policy will have on the country\u2019s farmland.

          "body": "BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A powerful blizzard battered the U.S. Northeast on Thursday, knocking out power for tens of thousands of people and snarling travel amid a cold snap that has gripped much of the United States for over a week and killed more than a dozen people.  Thousands of flights were canceled, firefighters scrambled to rescue motorists from flooded streets in Boston, National Guard troops were mobilized in the Northeast and New York City\u2019s two main airports halted flights because of whiteout conditions.  \u201cToday, I thought Manhattan was going to have the streets cleaned up, but I see not,\u201d said Valentine Williams, who usually operates an electric scooter to deliver food in New York City.  The snow forced Williams, 28, to make deliveries on foot. No customers complained that he was slower than usual. \u201cThey\u2019re just surprised that I\u2019m out here,\u201d he added.   Officials feared fast-dropping temperatures after the storm passed would turn snow on roadways to ice.  Ahead of that threat, snow plows and salt trucks were dispatched along streets and highways, and schools were closed through much of the region. In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh said schools would remain closed on Friday.   Blizzard warnings were in effect along the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine. The U.S. National Weather Service measured wind gusts of more than 70 miles per hour (113 kph), which downed power lines.  Almost 80,000 homes and businesses in the Northeast and Southeast, where the storm struck on Wednesday, were without power.  The Boston area received 12 inches of snow, with more on the way, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of New Jersey were buried under nearly a foot and a half of powder.  The storm was powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d It brought high winds and swift, heavy snowfall.  The wintry weather has been blamed for at least 14 deaths in the past few days, including four in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas because of the cold.  Nearly 500 members of the National Guard were activated along the East Coast to assist with emergency response, including 200 in New York state, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement.   More than 5,000 U.S. airline flights were canceled. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy (JFK) and LaGuardia airports, all flights were temporarily halted because of whiteout conditions, the Federal Aviation Administration said. LaGuardia on Thursday evening announced on Twitter that the suspension had been lifted. But the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said flights at JFK would not resume until 7 a.m. Friday.   Passenger train operator Amtrak ran reduced service in the Northeast. Sporadic delays were reported on transit systems, including New York\u2019s Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines, as well as the Boston area\u2019s Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority system.  \u201cYears of Band-Aid solutions create nightmare situations when storm damage occurs,\u201d said Joseph Schwieterman, a professor of public policy and specialist in transportation systems at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cReplacement parts are tough to find and maintenance process turns into major headache.\u201d  In New York\u2019s Fort Greene neighborhood, Mohammed Farid Khan said his morning commute took three times as long as usual because of train woes.  \u201cThere were only local trains, no express,\u201d Khan, 30, said as he hunched with an electric drill trying to fix the handle of his snow shovel inside the convenience store where he works.   A 3-foot (0.9-meter) tidal surge flooded the area around Boston\u2019s historic Long Wharf with icy seawater. Firefighters used an inflatable raft to rescue one motorist from a car submerged in water up to its door handles, Boston Fire Commissioner Joseph Finn told reporters.  The flooding tied a 40-year record, the National Weather Service said.  Boston officials briefly thought they would need to a evacuate a shelter near the flooded areas, Walsh said.   Officials reported traffic accidents throughout the Northeast and the storm\u2019s reach extended to eastern Canada.  On Wednesday, the same storm brought historic cities in the Southeastern United States their heaviest snowfall in three decades.

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cannabis businesses across the United States said they are bracing for an investment slowdown following the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Thursday directive that will allow the enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states that have legalized the drug.  U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department was rescinding an Obama-era policy that eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws amid a wave of legalization in states from Alaska to Pennsylvania.  \u201cIn the short term, this news will further scare away investors which will, in turn, slow down cannabis entrepreneurship,\u201d said Nicolas Ruiz, co-founder of Cloudponics, a San Francisco startup that makes technology which can be used to grow marijuana.  Marijuana legalization has spurred new businesses from growers to retailers, delivery services, providers of supplies and technology startups serving the industry.  Lawmakers from U.S. states that have legalized marijuana, including California and Colorado, denounced the directive, vowing to enforce their laws and protect the burgeoning cannabis industry.  \u201cIn California, we decided it was best to regulate, not criminalize, cannabis,\u201d said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. \u201cUnlike others, we embrace, not fear, change.\u201d  The shift in policy comes just three days after California launched the world\u2019s largest regulated commercial market for recreational marijuana.  Funding for cannabis startups has surged since Colorado\u2019s legalization of recreational marijuana use in 2014. Since then, the industry has seen nearly $1.3 billion in equity funding, with more than $600 million in 2017 alone, according to research firm CB Insights.  \u201cWhile it\u2019s unclear if this directive is going to directly impact cannabis funding itself, it demonstrates that the space is still very uncertain from a regulatory standpoint,\u201d said Nikhil Krishnan, senior intelligence analyst for CB Insights. \u201cThat uncertainty alone makes many investors uncomfortable and can hamper a company operating in the space.\u201d  Investors and entrepreneurs point to the industry\u2019s momentum as a reason for remaining bullish on the sector\u2019s prospects.  \u201cThe train has already left the station,\u201d said Jonathan Rubin, chief executive of New Leaf Data Services in Stamford, Connecticut, forecasting a backlash from voters, patients and politicians. New Leaf runs a data and pricing service for cannabis clients.   Others say the directive has them concerned.  Still, Mike Kramer, CEO of 420Blockchain, a Boca Raton, Florida, startup whose technology lets cannabis companies track their supply chain, said the industry was concerned, if determined. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be resilient,\u201d he said.  Steve DeAngelo, executive director of Oakland, California,  dispensary Harborside, said he has no plans to change his operations nor does he expect the Justice Department directive to impact his business, which begin selling recreational marijuana this week.  \u201cEvery day, I instruct my employees to scrupulously observe California\u2019s laws and regulations regarding cannabis,\u201d DeAngelo said. \u201cWe did that yesterday, we are doing that today, and we will continue to do it tomorrow and well into the future.\u201d  Reporting by Salvador Rodriguez and Chris Prentice; Editing by Leslie Adler and Cynthia Osterman"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday rescinded an Obama administration policy that had eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states that legalized the drug, instead giving federal prosecutors wide latitude to pursue criminal charges.  The action by Attorney General Jeff Sessions could have damaging consequences for the burgeoning marijuana industry in the six states including California and Colorado that have legalized the drug for recreational use, plus dozens of others that permit medicinal use.  Justice Department officials declined to say whether they might take legal action against those states, saying further steps were \u201cstill under consideration.\u201d   Federal law still prohibits marijuana even as some states move to legalize it. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said President Donald Trump\u2019s top priority was enforcing federal law \u201cwhether it\u2019s marijuana or immigration.\u201d  The policy change, detailed by Sessions in a one-page memo to federal prosecutors nationwide, came three days after California formally launched the world\u2019s largest regulated commercial market for recreational marijuana.  The administration\u2019s action drew condemnation from marijuana legalization advocates and politicians in both parties in states where the drug has been legalized. They said it trampled on the rights of voters in those states and created uncertainty about how strictly federal drugs laws will be enforced.  The move raised questions about how it might impact tax revenues in states that permit some form of legal marijuana use. It also created uncertainty for banks, already fearful about business relationships with the marijuana industry because of concerns they might run afoul of anti-money laundering rules.   There has been a surge in legalization of marijuana at the state level in recent years. Other states that permit the regulated sale of marijuana for recreational use include Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and Nevada. Massachusetts and Maine are on track to do so this year.  The policy put in place under Democratic former President Barack Obama, outlined by then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole in a series of memos, had discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing marijuana-related criminal cases in states that had legalized the drug.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sessions said in a statement that the Obama-era policy \u201cundermines the rule of law\u201d and told federal prosecutors in his memo to \u201cfollow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions\u201d in deciding which marijuana-related activities to prosecute.  Some prosecutors in legalization states issued statements on how they would proceed. A U.S. attorney in Colorado said he would not change his approach toward marijuana prosecutions, while a U.S. attorney in Massachusetts said he would pursue federal marijuana criminal cases.  The Trump administration\u2019s action seemed incongruous with comments that Trump, a Republican, made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump told a TV news reporter that the decision to legalize marijuana should be left \u201cup to the states.\u201d  California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said his state will pursue \u201call legal, legislative and political options to protect its reforms and its rights as a state.\u201d He said the Trump administration\u2019s position \u201cdefies facts and logic.\u201d  Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado said on Twitter that the administration\u2019s action \u201cdirectly contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation.\u201d  Gardner said he would take all steps necessary to fight the measure, including possibly holding up the Senate from voting on pending Justice Department nominees.  The Obama-era policy recognized marijuana as a \u201cdangerous drug,\u201d but said the Justice Department expected states and localities that authorized various uses to effectively regulate and police it.  Among companies that have invested in the industry, Scotts Miracle-Gro, a gardening product manufacturer, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire companies that sell soil, lighting, fertilizer and other products to marijuana growers. Shares in the company closed down about 2.3 percent. Several Canadian marijuana-related stocks also fell.  Marijuana startup companies said they were now bracing for a deceleration in funding.  \u201cIn the short term, this news will further scare away investors, which will, in turn, slow down cannabis entrepreneurship,\u201d said Nicolas Ruiz, co-founder of Cloudponics, a San Francisco startup whose technology can be used to grow marijuana.

The Sessions memo did not distinguish between enforcement against marijuana used for recreational versus medicinal purposes. But his department\u2019s ability to pursue criminal charges related to medicinal marijuana remains in doubt.  Since 2014, federal lawmakers have attached language to spending legislation that explicitly bars the Justice Department from spending resources to enforce cases in states where medicinal marijuana is legal.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) agreed to pay $15 million to settle nationwide antitrust litigation by passengers who accused the four largest U.S. carriers of conspiring to raise fares by reducing seating capacity.  U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C. granted preliminary approval on Wednesday for the accord with the Dallas-based carrier.  Southwest denied wrongdoing but said it settled to avoid the cost and distraction of further litigation.  It is the first defendant to settle and agreed to help the plaintiffs with their case against the remaining defendants, which are American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N).  Those carriers have also denied wrongdoing. The litigation began in 2015 after the U.S. Department of Justice began probing possible collusion. It has yet to take any formal action.  The passenger litigation combined more than 100 private lawsuits filed around the country.  Passengers claimed that the airlines\u2019 collusion began in early 2009, led to higher fares and reduced flight choices, and together with low fuel prices and higher fees for checking bags and other services helped the industry post record profits.  According to government data, American, Delta, Southwest and United together commanded a roughly 69 percent share of the U.S. domestic air travel market from October 2016 to September 2017.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors sitting on U.S. stock returns need a place to put the money, and the big winners are international markets and high-rated debt issuers from corporations to governments.  U.S. fund investors pulled $8.4 billion from stocks and funneled $3.3 billion into taxable bonds during the most recent week, responding defensively to a strong year of market gains, Lipper data showed on Thursday.  It is a continuation of a theme that dominated in 2017: Investors raided strong-performing domestic stock funds and put the money elsewhere. But the trend is a break from the axiomatic truth that flows chase performance.  Domestic equity funds posted outflows of $27.3 billion in 2017, according to preliminary year-end data from Lipper, marking a third year of outflows for the category.  \u201cIt was a phenomenal year as far as returns go,\u201d said Tom Roseen, head of research services for Thomson Reuters\u2019 Lipper unit. He said the average equity fund was up more than 20 percent for the year, adding, \u201cBut what we saw was a mass exodus from retail.\u201d  Non-domestic equity fund inflows of $171.4 billion and Treasury fund inflows of $34 billion for the year are the largest on records dating to 1992. Emerging market inflows were the biggest since 2010, Lipper\u2019s preliminary data showed.  That cash from U.S. investors is helping keep bond yields and borrowing costs low worldwide.  Yet the domestic equity outflows are not universal.  Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), many of which track an index and charge lower fees than funds run by stockpickers trying to beat the market, had another record year of inflows.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors sitting on U.S. stock returns need a place to put the money, and the big winners are international markets and high-rated debt issuers from corporations to governments.  U.S. fund investors pulled $8.4 billion from stocks and funneled $3.3 billion into taxable bonds during the most recent week, responding defensively to a strong year of market gains, Lipper data showed on Thursday.  It is a continuation of a theme that dominated in 2017: Investors raided strong-performing domestic stock funds and put the money elsewhere. But the trend is a break from the axiomatic truth that flows chase performance.  Domestic equity funds posted outflows of $27.3 billion in 2017, according to preliminary year-end data from Lipper, marking a third year of outflows for the category.  \u201cIt was a phenomenal year as far as returns go,\u201d said Tom Roseen, head of research services for Thomson Reuters\u2019 Lipper unit. He said the average equity fund was up more than 20 percent for the year, adding, \u201cBut what we saw was a mass exodus from retail.\u201d  Non-domestic equity fund inflows of $171.4 billion and Treasury fund inflows of $34 billion for the year are the largest on records dating to 1992. Emerging market inflows were the biggest since 2010, Lipper\u2019s preliminary data showed.  That cash from U.S. investors is helping keep bond yields and borrowing costs low worldwide.  Yet the domestic equity outflows are not universal.  Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), many of which track an index and charge lower fees than funds run by stockpickers trying to beat the market, had another record year of inflows.  Technology-focused equity funds pulled in about $13 billion for the year, the most since the sector\u2019s boom year in 2000, when they pulled in $41 billion, before the sector tanked.

          "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will plant new forests covering an area roughly the size of Ireland this year as it aims to increase forest coverage to 23 percent of its total landmass by the end of the decade, China Daily reported on Friday.  Planting trees has become a key part of China\u2019s efforts to improve its environment and tackle climate change, and the government has pledged to raise total coverage from 21.7 percent to 23 percent over the 2016-2020 period, said the China Daily, citing the country\u2019s top forestry official.  Zhang Jianlong, head of the State Forestry Administration, said at a meeting on Thursday that China would aim to grow at least 6.66 million hectares of new forest this year.  He said 33.8 million hectares of forest had been planted nationwide over the last five years, with a total investment of more than 538 billion yuan ($82.88 billion), bringing the country\u2019s total forest area to 208 million hectares.  Three new state forests with a total area of 483,000 hectares would also be built in the new Xiongan development zone in Hebei province, he said.  The heavily polluted Hebei, which surrounds the capital Beijing, has also pledged to raise total forest coverage to 35 percent by the end of 2020.  China, which has to feed a quarter of the global population using just 7 percent of the world\u2019s arable land, has long struggled to strike a balance between industrial growth, maximizing food production and protecting its environment.   The government is currently promoting an \u201cecological red line\u201d program which will force provinces and regions to restrict \u201cirrational development\u201d and curb construction near rivers, forests and national parks.   The environment ministry said last month that 15 provinces had already drawn up plans, with the remaining 16 aiming to do so this year, but it is not yet clear what impact the policy will have on the country\u2019s farmland.

          "body": "(Corrects corporate identifier for Southwest to Co from Inc in first paragraph)  By Jonathan Stempel  Jan 4 (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co agreed to pay $15 million to settle nationwide antitrust litigation by passengers who accused the four largest U.S. carriers of conspiring to raise fares by reducing seating capacity.  U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C. granted preliminary approval on Wednesday for the accord with the Dallas-based carrier.  Southwest denied wrongdoing but said it settled to avoid the cost and distraction of further litigation.  It is the first defendant to settle and agreed to help the plaintiffs with their case against the remaining defendants, which are American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc.  Those carriers have also denied wrongdoing. The litigation began in 2015 after the U.S. Department of Justice began probing possible collusion. It has yet to take any formal action.  The passenger litigation combined more than 100 private lawsuits filed around the country.  Passengers claimed that the airlines\u2019 collusion began in early 2009, led to higher fares and reduced flight choices, and together with low fuel prices and higher fees for checking bags and other services helped the industry post record profits.  According to government data, American, Delta, Southwest and United together commanded a roughly 69 percent share of the U.S. domestic air travel market from October 2016 to September 2017.  In statements on Thursday, American spokesman Matt Miller said, \u201cWe will continue to defend against the claims, which we believe are without merit,\u201d while Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said, \u201cThe simple fact is that Delta has not engaged in any illegal behavior.\u201d  United was not immediately available for comment.  Kollar-Kotelly called Southwest\u2019s settlement \u201csufficiently fair, reasonable and adequate\u201d to justify preliminary approval.  Final approvals typically occur a few months after preliminary approvals are granted and after people are given a chance to object.

          "body": "* Euro short distance away from 3-year high vs dollar  * Combo of strong euro zone data, dollar weakness support euro  * Dollar/yen manages to rise as risk appetite hits Japanese unit  * A$ headed for 4th week of gains, commodity currencies strong  By Shinichi Saoshiro  TOKYO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a three-year high against the sagging dollar on Friday, while improving investor risk appetite weighed on the yen.  The euro was steady at $1.2069 after rising 0.45 percent overnight.  The common currency, supported in part by narrowing U.S.-euro zone debt yield spreads, has gained 0.6 percent so far this week. A rise above $1.2092 would take it to its highest level since January 2015.  The euro received its latest boost overnight as data showed the euro zone economy closed out 2017 with the strongest growth in nearly seven years.  Weighed down by the greenback\u2019s weakness against the euro, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was poised on a loss of 0.3 percent this week, during which it probed a three-month low of 91.751. The index was also headed for its third week of losses.  The U.S. currency\u2019s weakness was highlighted overnight as the dollar failed to draw support from stronger-than-expected jobs report. U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, data from ADP Research Institute showed, the biggest monthly increase since March.  The markets are now focused on Friday\u2019s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show job gains of 190,000 for December.  Given the dollar\u2019s recent poor showing, market participants reckon stronger-than-expected employment gains and growth in wages would be needed to turn fortunes around for the currency.  \u201cIt is the same theme from 2017 that is hurting the dollar, which is low inflation concerns, which in turn has capped Treasury yields,\u201d said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  \u201cThe euro, on the other hand, is on a roll. We see the euro zone HICP figures out later today and if that proves to be strong, that could offset a decent U.S. jobs report from the dollar\u2019s perspective,\u201d Ishikawa said.  The euro zone\u2019s harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) for December is due later on Friday.  The Australian dollar extended gains from the previous day and rose to $0.7869, its highest since Oct. 20.  The Aussie was on track for its fourth straight week of gains, with the recent surge in prices of commodities like copper and iron ore providing a lift.  The Canadian dollar has also benefited from surging commodities, with crude oil prices at their highest since 2015.  The loonie was headed for its third straight week of gains, having touched a 2-1/2-month high of C$1.2485 per dollar overnight.  The yen was an exception among the major currencies, having sunk this week against its peers like the dollar, euro and Aussie.  The Japanese currency depreciated against the broadly weaker greenback due to increasing investor appetite for risk in the broader markets, which dimmed its allure as a perceived safe haven.  The dollar was little changed at 112.790 yen after rising about 0.2 percent on Thursday. It was little changed against the yen this week, during which it had momentarily slipped to a two-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday. (Editing by Kim Coghill)"

          "body": "(Repeats story from late on Thursday)  * China bans under-the-table transactions that skirt rules  * Beijing sets \u201csoft\u201d caps on repo, reverse repo trading volume  * Changes underscore coordinated efforts to cut financial leverage  SHANGHAI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - China released new rules tightening bond trading regulations on Thursday, with a focus on restricting leverage and banning under-the-table deals.  The regulations, jointly issued by the People\u2019s Bank of China and China\u2019s banking, securities and insurance regulators, come as Beijing launches a series of co-ordinated initiatives across government agencies designed to reduce leverage in the financial system.  Under the new rules, published on the central bank\u2019s website, institutions must sign written deals when conducting bond repurchase or bond forward transactions. Any deals designed to dodge regulatory requirements are to be banned.  The rules order financial institutions to report financial data to regulators if their outstanding repurchase agreements, known as repos, and reverse repo volumes exceed a certain limit.  A version of the rules seen by Reuters earlier on Thursday and confirmed to be authentic by three sources was dated Dec. 29. The document posted on the PBOC\u2019s website did not include a specific date but carried the year 2017.  China is escalating a campaign to reduce excessive leverage in the banking system that threatens financial stability.  In November, Beijing formally set up its State Council Financial Stability and Development Committee to strengthen financial supervision. In the same month, the central bank drafted sweeping rules to tighten supervision of the country\u2019s $9 trillion asset management industry to curb shadow banking.  \u201cAll these measures are aimed at deleveraging, and preventing systemic risks in the financial industry, after years of aggressive expansion by financial institutions,\u201d said Zhang Zibing, chief investment officer at Shanghai-based asset manager Bona Capital.  \u201cBanks must change their mentality, both in their growth models, and in how they allocate their assets,\u201d Zhang said, adding he expects bond yields to remain elevated this year.  Yields of China\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bonds climbed steadily in 2017, and on Thursday hovered around the highest level in three years, at 3.937 percent.  By publishing the rules, regulators are seeking to avoid a repeat of the $2.4 billion bond scandal involving Chinese brokerage Sealand Securities in late 2016, which triggered panic across the country\u2019s financial markets.  Although Sealand Securities blamed \u201cforged\u201d bond agreements, analysts largely pointed to a popular practice called \u201cdaichi\u201d, which is Chinese for \u201cpledged financing\u201d and works in a similar manner to repo agreements, although such transactions are made through informal, oral agreements.  The new rules would effectively terminate the practice, which traders have used to keep increased leverage off the regulatory radar.  They would also restrict leverage by setting a cap on repo or reserve transactions, tools which help some institutions channel short-term borrowings into longer-term assets for profit.  For deposit-taking institutions, if the outstanding volume of such transactions exceeds 80 percent of their net assets, they need to report their financial data to regulators.  The cap is 120 percent for securities firms, fund houses and futures brokerages. For insurers, the limit is set at 20 percent of their total assets.  The rules called on bond market participants to reasonably control leverage ratios on bond trading and strictly abide by liquidity, leverage and ratio requirements.

          "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daniel Gruss didn\u2019t sleep much the night he hacked his own computer and exposed a flaw in most of the chips made in the past two decades by hardware giant Intel Corp (INTC.O).  The 31-year-old information security researcher and post-doctoral fellow at Austria\u2019s Graz Technical University had just breached the inner sanctum of his computer\u2019s central processing unit (CPU) and stolen secrets from it.  Until that moment, Gruss and colleagues Moritz Lipp and Michael Schwarz had thought such an attack on the processor\u2019s \u2018kernel\u2019 memory, which is meant to be inaccessible to users, was only theoretically possible.  \u201cWhen I saw my private website addresses from Firefox being dumped by the tool I wrote, I was really shocked,\u201d Gruss told Reuters in an email interview, describing how he had unlocked personal data that should be secured.  Gruss, Lipp and Schwarz, working from their homes on a weekend in early December, messaged each other furiously to verify the result.  \u201cWe sat for hours in disbelief until we eliminated any possibility that this result was wrong,\u201d said Gruss, whose mind kept racing even after powering down his computer, so he barely caught a wink of sleep.  Gruss and his colleagues had just confirmed the existence of what he regards as \u201cone of the worst CPU bugs ever found\u201d.  The flaw, now named Meltdown, was revealed on Wednesday and affects most processors manufactured by Intel since 1995.  Separately, a second defect called Spectre has been found that also exposes core memory in most computers and mobile devices running on chips made by Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (AMD.O) and ARM Holdings, a unit of Japan\u2019s Softbank (9984.T).   Both would enable a hacker to access secret passwords or photos from desktops, laptops, cloud servers or smartphones. It\u2019s not known whether criminals have been able to carry out such attacks as neither Meltdown nor Spectre leave any traces in log files.  Intel says it has started providing software and firmware updates to mitigate the security issues. ARM has also said it was working with AMD and Intel on security fixes.  The discovery was originally reported by online tech journal The Register. As a result of that report, research on the defect was published a week earlier than the manufacturers had planned, before some had time to work out a complete fix.  The Graz team had already been working on a tool to defend against attempts to steal secrets from kernel memory.   In a paper presented last June they called it KAISER, or Kernel Address Isolation to have Side-channels Effectively Removed.  As the name suggests, KAISER seeks to defend the kernel memory from a so-called side-channel attack that exploits a design feature of modern processors that increases their speed.  This involves processors executing tasks \u201cout-of-order\u201d, and not in the sequence received. If the CPU makes the right speculative call, time is saved. Get it wrong and the out-of-order task is cancelled and no time is lost.  Researcher Anders Fogh wrote in a subsequent blog that it might be possible to abuse so-called speculative execution in order to read kernel memory. He was not able to do so in practice, however. (bit.ly/2vpkut0)  Only after the December self-hacking episode did the significance of Graz team\u2019s earlier work become clear. It turned out that the KAISER tool presented an effective defence against Meltdown.  The team quickly got in touch with Intel and learned that other researchers - inspired in part by Fogh\u2019s blog - had made similar discoveries.  They were working under so-called responsible disclosure, where researchers inform affected companies of their findings to give them time to prepare \u2018patches\u2019 to repair flaws they have exposed.  The key players were independent researcher Paul Kocher and the team at a company called Cyberus Technology, said Gruss, while Jann Horn at Google Project Zero (GOOGL.O) came to similar conclusions independently.  \"We merged our efforts in mid-December with the team around Paul Kocher and the people from Cyberus Technology to work on two solid publications on Meltdown and Spectre,\" said Gruss. (www.meltdownattack.com)  Gruss had not even been aware of the work Horn was doing. (here)   \u201cJann Horn developed all of this independently - that\u2019s incredibly impressive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe developed very similar attacks, but we were a team of 10 researchers.\u201d  The wider team said patches for Meltdown, based on KAISER, had been readied for Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) operating systems, as well as for the Linux open-source system.  There is as yet no fix for Spectre, which tricks programmes into leaking their secrets but is viewed as a harder exploit for a hacker to carry out.  Asked which of the two flaws posed the greater challenge, Gruss said: \u201cThe immediate problem is Meltdown.  \u201cAfter that it is going to be Spectre. Spectre is more difficult to exploit but also to mitigate. So in the long run I\u2019d bet on Spectre.\u201d  (This story has been refiled to remove incorrect detail on name given to app in paragraph 13, amends detail about blog in paragraph 17.)

          "title": "Trump administration aims to open nearly all U.S. offshore to oil drilling",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, a move aimed at boosting domestic energy production that sparked protests from coastal states, environmentalists and the tourism industry.  The effort to open previously off-limits acreage in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans comes less than eight years after BP Plc\u2019s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico - the largest in American history. The disaster caused billions of dollars in economic damage and led former President Barack Obama\u2019s to increase regulation of the industry.  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Thursday the department\u2019s draft National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2019 to 2024 would make over 90 percent of the outer continental shelf\u2019s total acreage available for leasing to drillers, a national record.   That would reverse the Obama administration order placing 94 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers. Obama\u2019s 2017-2022 plan would be replaced by the new program when it is finalized.  \u201cWe want to grow our nation\u2019s offshore energy industry, instead of slowly surrendering it to foreign shores,\u201d Zinke said in prepared remarks.   He said 25 of 26 planning areas on the Outer Continental Shelf will be considered for leasing, covering all U.S. coastlines. Proposed sales include 19 off the coast of Alaska, seven in the Pacific, 12 in the Gulf of Mexico and nine in the Atlantic Region. The last offshore lease sales for the East and West coasts were in the 1980s.  Alaska\u2019s North Aleutian Basin/Bristol Bay will be exempted after drilling was barred there by a previous executive order.  Zinke said the proposal was just the start of a dialogue with local stakeholders and the plan was not final. The draft will be subject to a 60-day comment period.  The proposal marks a huge shift from previous policy.  Weeks before leaving office, Obama banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, protecting 115 million acres (46.5 million hectares) of waters off Alaska and 3.8 million acres (1.5 million hectares)in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay.   Trump in April ordered the Interior Department to overhaul the leasing schedule to promote increased drilling. At the time, low oil prices and soaring onshore production were curtailing demand for offshore leases, raising questions about the benefits of the move. Oil prices have since risen to around three-year highs.  Industry groups welcomed Thursday\u2019s announcement.   \u201cExpanding access to additional offshore reserves allows the United States to better understand where production potential exists and where capital should be invested,\u201d said Independent Petroleum Association of America senior vice president Dan Naatz.    But lawmakers from both parties, environmental groups,  governors and local business leaders said they were opposed to any effort to open coastlines to drilling rigs, citing environmental risks and threats to lucrative tourism industries.  Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott said he is aggressively fighting to plan. \u201cI have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,\u201d he said.  Environmental groups described the plan as dangerous.  \u201cTrump\u2019s trying to turn our oceans into oilfields. His reckless plan would expose more wildlife and coastal communities to devastating oil spills,\u201d said Kristen Monsell, ocean program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity.       Coastal tourism business groups were girding for a long fight against the proposal, which comes as the Gulf Coast recovers from the Deepwater spill. The plan would open the California coast where drilling opposition has been fierce since a major oil spill in the 1960s soiled popular beaches.  Frank Knapp, founder of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, accused the federal agency of favoring the oil and gas sector over the tourism sector.  \u201cWhat part of the business sector are they listening to? It\u2019s certainly not small or coastal businesses,\u201d Knapp said.  The Defense Department has also raised concerns about opening drilling that had been banned off the eastern Gulf of Mexico, where military exercises are held.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci was given a five-month, back-dated doping suspension but was considered not guilty of any \u201csignificant fault or negligence,\u201d the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme said on Thursday.  Bellucci, who reached a career-high 21st in the world rankings in 2010 but has fallen to 112th, provided a urine sample at last July\u2019s Swedish Open that contained hydrochlorothiazide, which can mask other substances.  The 30-year-old Brazilian, who said the positive test was the result of a contaminated vitamin supplement, refused to accept a voluntary provisional suspension and so was free to compete pending resolution of his case.  The Tennis Anti-Doping Programme said in a statement it accepted Bellucci\u2019s account of how the banned substance got in his system.  It also said that his period of ineligibility was backdated due to the player\u2019s prompt admission and for delays not attributable to him.  Bellucci can start competing again from Feb. 1, meaning he will miss the Jan. 15-28 Australian Open. Bellucci, who has never been beyond the second round at Melbourne Park, would have had to qualify for the tournament given his low ranking.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - London was the top city in Europe for technology investment last year, with more funding going into companies in the British capital than into firms based in Paris, Berlin and the next seven cities combined, data showed on Friday.  Tech firms in London attracted 2.45 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) in venture capital funding in 2017, about 80 percent of the 2.99 billion pounds invested in Britain as a whole, according to data compiled by funding database PitchBook for London & Partners.  Eileen Burbidge, partner at Passion Capital, said it was no surprise to see London - and Britain - leading the pack because it has both the talent and investor capital needed.  \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to our exceptional entrepreneurs that the UK tech sector continues to produce companies that are leading in the development of cutting edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and fintech,\u201d she said.  Fintech, or financial technology, was the most popular segment for investors, attracting a record 1.34 billion pounds in venture capital, the data showed, led by major rounds for TransferWise, Funding Circle and Monzo.   Artificial intelligence (AI) was another growth area, with UK-based AI firms raising 488 million pounds, double the amount a year earlier, the data showed.  Other big deals last year included a 391 million pound investment into Improbable, whose software creates large-scale simulations in the cloud; 364 million pounds for food delivery company Deliveroo; and 255 million pounds for mobile phone firm Truphone.   Burbidge said the biggest threat to Britain\u2019s leadership was any restrictions in its ability to attract the best talent after the country leaves the European Union next year.  \u201cAccess to talent is critically important,\u201d she said.   \u201cBeing able to attract EU talent has been a huge advantage for the UK in the last few years.

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britons sipping on hot tea or strong coffee should pay an extra 25 pence ($0.34) \u201clatte levy\u201d if they use a disposable cup, common in coffee shops and fast food eateries, British lawmakers said on Friday.  The government should also ensure that all disposable cups are recycled by 2023 or introduce a total ban if that target is not met, an Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) report found.  Mary Creagh, chairwoman of the parliamentary group, said it was time for a \u201crevolution\u201d in recycling.  \u201cThe UK throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year, enough to circle the planet five and a half times,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cAlmost none are recycled and half a million a day are littered.\u201d  The 25 pence charge would go toward improving Britain\u2019s recycling and reprocessing facilities, the report said.  Some coffee shops in Britain already provide discounts to customers who bring their own cups.  The sandwich chain Pret A Manger said last month that it will increase its discount for bringing a reusable cup from 25 pence to 50 pence from January 2018.   Green Party lawmaker and EAC committee member Caroline Lucas told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the reforms were \u201clong overdue\u201d and hoped that they would change behavior.  \u201cThis is now a 10 billion pound industry, and the businesses involved need to show leadership and work quickly towards 100 percent recyclability, or face an outright ban - the time for talking is over,\u201d she said in emailed comments.  In 2015, Britain introduced a 5 pence charge for plastic carrier bags, legislation that slashed usage and has taken about 9 billion plastic bags out of circulation, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.   The EAC said it had learnt from this example that consumers were often more responsive to charges than discounts.  \u201cThe UK has woken up and smelled the coffee cup nightmare,\u201d celebrity chef and environmental campaigner Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, said in a statement welcoming the report.  \u201cNow there\u2019s no way this horrendous and avoidable problem can be put back to sleep.\u201d  Reporting by Adela Suliman.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans will have to wait until 2019 for the planned final season of the award-winning medieval fantasy series, a gap of more than a year since the end of season seven.  Cable channel HBO said on Thursday that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d would return in 2019 for a six-episode final season. It did not specify the month.  The series is HBO\u2019s biggest hit ever with some 30 million viewers in the United States alone and an army of devoted fans worldwide.  The final season of the Emmy Award-winning show is expected to reveal which of the warring families in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros will win the multigenerational struggle for control of the Iron Throne.  Production on the final season started in October, and filming is expected to last until mid-2018. HBO\u2019s head of programming, Casey Bloys, has said multiple endings will be filmed to avoid leaks or hacks of how the saga ends.  Show creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss told Entertainment Weekly in 2016 that they wanted to make the series finale as spectacular as possible. HBO said on Thursday that Benioff and Weiss will also direct the final season.  The seventh season ended last August with an average of more than 30 million U.S. viewers per episode across multiple platforms. Some of its seven episodes were more than an hour long.  The long gap until the final season would give author George R.R. Martin the chance to finish one or two new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d books that he said in July he was working on. The television series has already advanced beyond the events of Martin\u2019s five published \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d series of novels.

          "body": "BERLIN, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called on Friday for a fresh start in his country\u2019s rocky relationship with Germany, holding out the prospect of closer economic cooperation, particularly in transport and energy, if ties improved.  In a column written for the Funke media group of newspapers for publication on Friday ahead of a meeting with his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel, Cavusoglu called for an end to the \u201ccurrent crisis spiral in our relationship\u201d.  \u201cBoth sides have an interest in a new start in the bilateral relationship as we live in a time full of challenges,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is not the time for bullhorn diplomacy.\u201d  Cavusoglu said Germany needed to develop a more \u201cempathetic\u201d tone in its dealings with Turkey. Berlin did not seem to fully understand the \u201ctrauma\u201d caused by a failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan in 2016.  Last month, Gabriel said Turkey\u2019s decision to release a sixth German citizen from jail gave hope that relations between the two NATO allies could improve after plumbing new lows following the coup attempt.  German politicians have been outspoken critics of Turkey\u2019s security crackdown since the coup. Tens of thousands of Turks have been jailed, including around a dozen German citizens. Germany is home to some 3 million people of Turkish heritage.  Ankara has criticised Berlin for not handing over asylum seekers it accuses of involvement in the failed coup.  Cavusoglu said an improved relationship could mean that the two countries could work more closely in areas including security and trade.  He said trade between Germany and Turkey amounted to 174 billion euros  ($209.91 billion)in the last five years, with major opportunities in the coming decade from big infrastructure projects, in particular in transport and renewable energy.  He stressed the importance of Turkey\u2019s role in stemming a wave of migrants to Germany under a deal with the European Union in 2016 and said he hoped that the EU would live up to its commitments to make it easier for Turks to get visas in return.  $1 = 0.8289 euros\nReporting by Emma Thomasson; editing by Ralph Boulton"

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - British new car sales recorded their biggest drop since 2009 last year, falling by more than 5 percent due to uncertainty over potential new diesel charges and weakening consumer confidence since Brexit, an industry body said on Friday.  Registrations ended 2017 at around 2.54 million vehicles, according to provisional data, and are set to fall up to 7 percent this year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.  Demand for diesel cars fell 17 percent as consumers were put off by potential new charges, pushing up average CO2 emissions for new cars for the first time in two decades as some switched to petrol.  Last year\u2019s drop in total sales is the biggest since demand nosedived in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, but comes after two years of record highs in 2015 and 2016.  Sales in December fell 13.9 percent and SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said further declines were likely over the next few months.  \u201cThe two main reasons are business-led and consumer confidence and the confusion around diesel which has caused hold-off,\u201d he said of last year\u2019s fall.  \u201cThe first quarter is going to be tough and March (last year) in particular was an all-time record month. We ain\u2019t going to get that next March.\u201d  Britain\u2019s automotive sector is also concerned its cars could face tariffs of up to 10 percent and be hit by customs delays if the government fails to strike the right Brexit deal.  There are investment decisions which are pending as companies await clarification on the terms of a transitional deal which will bridge Britain\u2019s exit from the EU in March 2019 into a new relationship with the bloc, Hawes said.  \u201cSome of those decisions are overdue, they need clarity urgently and certainly the turn of the first quarter is what they have been saying to me,\u201d he said.  Honda is one of several carmakers considering contingency plans involving possible extra warehousing and stockpiling of parts and has said it needs clarity by March on a transitional deal.  Hawes said any additional cost borne by British plants could hit the sector.  \u201cThat\u2019s the thin end of the wedge ... How do you secure that next piece of investment when you\u2019re less competitive because you\u2019ve got to warehouse?\u201d (Editing by Mark Potter)"

          "body": "* Underlying UK sales down 2.3 pct in December - BDO  * Shop prices fell 0.6 pct - BRC  LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - British shops suffered a fall in underlying sales in December for the fifth straight year, a survey showed on Friday, adding to evidence consumers are tightening their belts.  Britons are being squeezed by slow wage growth and a jump in inflation that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, prompting many forecasters to predict a further weakening in the overall economy this year after a slowdown in 2017.  Accountancy and business advisory firm BDO said its monthly High Street Sales Tracker (HSST) showed a 2.3 percent fall in like-for-like sales in December.  It said fashion sales fell 3.8 percent, while sales of homewares were up 2.5 percent.  BDO said its data reinforced reports of a last minute Christmas buying spree. It said all categories recorded year-on-year growth in the week to Dec. 24, after negative like-for-like sales in the first three weeks of December.  \u201cWith discretionary spend under pressure, shoppers have been forced to think twice before making their purchases and have shown a preference to prioritise spend on food and drink, home comforts and trips out to restaurants and bars this festive season,\u201d Sophie Michael, BDO\u2019s head of retail and wholesale, said.  A separate survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed shop prices fell by an annual 0.6 percent in December, the sharpest decline since March 2017, as retailers offered larger discounts for non-food goods.  By contrast, food price inflation picked up last month.  \u201cMany non-food retailers have been keeping prices low to stimulate spending, which will undoubtedly have come at a cost to margins,\u201d said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen, which conducted the BRC survey.  Department store chain Debenhams issued a profit warning on Thursday after it was forced to cut prices to drive sales of Christmas gifts, illustrating the challenges facing some of Britain\u2019s best known retailers.  But clothing seller Next, the first major British listed retailer to report on Christmas trading, beat expectations and upgraded its profit outlook.  A string of retail companies, including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Marks & Spencer , are scheduled to update on festive trading next week.  Reporting by James Davey and Andy Bruce.

          "title": "'Bomb cyclone' hits U.S. East Coast energy, power supply",
          "body": "NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A severe winter storm froze pipes and disrupted services at refineries on the U.S. Atlantic coast on Thursday, sending fuel prices higher as heavy snowfall and high winds caused electricity outages for almost 80,000 homes and businesses.  The only nuclear plant in Massachusetts was shut just after 2 p.m. because of the failure of a line that connects the reactor to the power grid. Entergy Corp (ETR.N), which operates the Pilgrim Station, said it had not identified the cause of the line problem. ISO New England, which operates the region\u2019s power grid, attributed the shutdown to blizzard conditions. The company did not say when the station would restart.  Utilities in the Southeast have restored service to some  customers who were hit by the storm overnight.  Heavy snow pounded the East Coast from Maine as far south as North Carolina on Thursday, taking out power lines, icing  roadways and closing schools.   The storm was powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters referred to as bombogenesis or a \u201cbomb cyclone,\u201d which brought high winds and swift, heavy snowfall.   The region has also been in the grip of a prolonged cold spell.   Prices for heating oil HO-NYH HO-DIFF-NYH and natural gas in the U.S. Northeast hit their highest levels in years on the back of near-record heating demand. Benchmark U.S. heating oil futures HOc1 are near their highest in almost three years.   The U.S. average home residential heating oil prices rose  5.4 percent to $3.078 a gallon in the week through Jan. 1 from a week earlier, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. On the East Coast, prices rose 5.4 percent to $3.085 a gallon.    U.S. average residential heating oil prices for the 2017-18 period are well above the 2016-17 levels, the data showed.   U.S. natural gas demand was expected to remain near record highs this week. Natural gas is the major fuel for residential and commercial heating in the U.S. Northeast and is also widely used by power plants.   On Thursday, natural gas futures NGc1 fell 12.8 cents, or 4.3 percent, to settle at $2.880 per million British thermal units. That was the biggest one-day decline for the contract in three weeks as less cold weather was predicted. However, regional prices soared under pressure from the cold snap.   U.S. spot natural gas and power prices on Thursday rose to their highest in years in several regions.   Next-day power prices in New England E-NEPLMHP-IDX and PJM E-PJWHRTP-IX, which covers much of the U.S. mid-Atlantic and Midwest region, rose to their highest since January 2014 due to a spike in local natural gas prices.  New England\u2019s cash prices LNG-CG-BS-SNL soared last week, and remained near four-year highs at $36.32 per mmBtu. ISO-New England, that region\u2019s power grid operator, said on Thursday that its power operators were relying more heavily on generators that burn heating oil due to heavy natural gas demand from homes and businesses.   \u201cWe expect to have sufficient capacity and fuel available and expect to be able to weather the storm without running up against significant emissions limits, but concerns remain the same regarding fuel availability and emissions limits throughout this protracted cold spell and the rest of the winter,\u201d the company said in a statement.  ISO New England spokeswoman Marcia Blomberg said there were \u201cno immediate reliability issues to the local area\u201d due to the shutdown of Pilgrim.   The lights did not go out in New England after the 688 megawatt Pilgrim plant shut because New England, like all U.S. power grids, keeps some generating plants in reserve in case an operating unit unexpectedly shuts. On Thursday, the grid had a reserve of over 2,100 MW. One megawatt is enough to power about 1,000 U.S. homes.  Blomberg added that the loss of Pilgrim \u201cdoes further challenge the region on fuel availability because we need to rely on other generating resources to meet consumer demand and meet overall grid reliability.\u201d  In New York, very few generator outages were reported and there were no problems with a lack of fuel, Wes Yeomans, vice president of Operations at the New York Independent System Operator, said on a call on Thursday.  There are concerns that a significant disruption could lead to a heating oil shortage as distillate inventories, including heating oil, in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions are at their lowest levels for this time of year since 2015.  This has spurred tankers carrying diesel and heating oil to set out from Europe bound for the United States to address supply worries, reversing a traditional trade route.  Icebreakers have been used in ports of Boston, New York and Philadelphia to keep shipping lanes clear, though delays are expected, and the Coast Guard said late on Wednesday that those ships would remain at shore until the storm had passed.      Reliance on heating oil is highest in the Northeast, with about 21 percent of households using oil for space heating.   Most northern U.S. refiners are not reporting problems. Phillips 66 (PSX.N) shut a crude and coking unit at its Wood River, Illinois, refinery after a frozen line and short-lived fire, a source said on Wednesday. It did not have a timeline for restarting the units at the Illinois plant, the source said.      Philadelphia Energy Solutions postponed planned work at its 335,000 refinery complex in Philadelphia until after the storm.   Crude carrier Ridgebury Pioneer, carrying 1.9 million barrels of heavy crude into the Philadelphia area, has been delayed by the storm, according to Reuters Eikon shipping data and two sources familiar with the delivery.

          "body": "SAN JOSE (Reuters) - It could take months to determine the cause of a plane crash in Costa Rica that killed 12 people because the aircraft was badly burned and lacked a flight data recorder, the director of the country\u2019s civil aviation agency told Reuters on Thursday.   Enio Cubillo also said that experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board came to Costa Rica on Thursday to assist the investigation, along with staff from the Federal Aviation Administration and Cessna, which made the plane.  He added that experts are analyzing weather conditions at the time of the crash last Sunday as well as possible mechanical failures and human error.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a single cause,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could take several months.\u201d  The accident took place near the Punta Islita beach town, about 230 km (140 miles) west of the capital of San Jose.  Because Punta Islita\u2019s small airfield lacks a control tower, the plane\u2019s status at the time of the crash was unknown, Cubillo said. It was not required to carry a black box flight data recorder because it had fewer than 19 passengers.        Ten U.S. citizens and two Costa Rican pilots, both of whom were experienced fliers, died in the incident, Cubillo said.  The U.S. victims included a family of five from New York.   Costa Rica\u2019s accident investigation team has begun examining the remains of the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, which crashed and ignited in a woodland roughly 1,310 feet (400 meters) from its departure point.  Remains of the plane\u2019s turbine will be sent to producer Pratt & Whitney in Canada for mechanical evaluations.       A video obtained from the civil aviation agency showed twisted and charred chunks of metal that are being examined by investigators, including pieces of the turbine, tail rudder and wings.  The plane had passed a safety inspection about a month ago and was authorized to fly, Cubillo has previously said. Although strong winds in the morning had forced the pilots to alter their itinerary, they had flown safely to Punta Islita to pick up passengers headed to San Jose.  Cubillo added on Thursday that strong winds at the time of the crash should not have impacted the flight.   \u201cThere were winds of some 20, 25 knots ... a speed that isn\u2019t ideal, but that should be perfectly withstood by an aircraft of this wingspan,\u201d he said.

          "title": "Metropolitan Museum to charge fixed admission fee for non-New Yorkers",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the world\u2019s most popular museums, will start charging a fixed admission fee for out-of-state visitors rather than urge they pay a suggested donation, museum officials announced on Thursday.  The shift comes as a growing number of visitors have opted out of paying the full suggested donation, currently $25 for adults, $17 for seniors and $12 for students, Daniel Weiss, the museum\u2019s president, told reporters.  From March 1, those suggested amounts will become mandatory for visitors who are not members and who do not live in New York State, getting them a three-day pass in return.   \u201cIn 2004, 63 percent of those who came paid the full recommended price,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIn 2017, that is 17 percent. Effectively the policy is failing.\u201d   New Yorkers will continue to pay what they wish, so long as it is a penny or more, as will students from the neighboring states of Connecticut and New Jersey and any child under 12 years old.  The new policy will affect about 31 percent of the roughly 7 million people visiting the museum each year, Weiss said. The extra $5 million to $11 million the museum estimates this will generate will be a modest boost towards covering its annual operating budget of about $305 million.   The museum, spread across three sites in the city, is home to thousands of exhibits, from ancient Egyptian art to Renaissance paintings. The city leased the land on which the main building sits, a prime slice of Manhattan\u2019s Central Park, in 1878 on condition that the museum be free to the public most days. The museum switched to suggested donations in the early 1970s but only updated its lease with the city to reflect this in 2013.  The lease amendment also allowed the possibility of the museum charging a compulsory entrance fee, with the city\u2019s consent, though the museum said in 2013 it had no plans to do so.  Weiss said the museum was unique among institutions of its size around the world in that it receives neither substantial state funding, as do the museums grouped under the Smithsonian in Washington, nor relies on fixed admission prices, as venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan do.  The city\u2019s government, which approved the change, currently covers a little less than 10 percent of the museum\u2019s expenses, Weiss said, but may reduce its contribution by up to $3 million in order to give more to other cultural institutions. Another 14 percent of revenue comes from donations at the door, a figure expected to rise to 16 or 17 percent under the new policy.

          "title": "Obiang, Son net scorchers as Spurs draw with West Ham",
          "body": "(Reuters) - - Tottenham Hotspur endured a night of frustration against London rivals West Ham United but were spared a shock defeat as Son Heung-min salvaged a 1-1 draw with a stunning late equalizer at Wembley on Thursday.  Good as Son\u2019s long-range swerving effort seven minutes from time was, it was still only the second-best goal of the night after Pedro Obiang\u2019s 70th-minute screamer put West Ham within sight of a smash-and-grab raid.  Tottenham, bidding to become the only top-flight club to take 12 points from the hectic holiday program and close on the Premier League\u2019s top four, spent all night trying to pick a way through the claret and blue barricade in front of them.  They ended the contest with 31 attempts to West Ham\u2019s three but were staring a costly defeat in the face when Obiang scored with the visitors\u2019 first attempt on goal.  On a rare foray forward the midfielder found himself in space and belted a right-foot shoot that left Spurs keeper clawing at thin air as the ball whistled into the top corner.  Tottenham poured forward in a desperate search to salvage something and Son delivered when he lashed a 25-metre effort past Adrian to finally puncture West Ham\u2019s resistance.  \u201cToday we had 31 attempts and we needed an amazing goal from Son (to get a point),\u201d Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino told reporters.  \u201cBut that is football. We deserved the three points but we have to be happy because when you concede a goal to their first chance it can complicated. We had to keep calm.\u201d  West Ham manager David Moyes said he was left in \u201cdisbelief\u201d when Obiang produced his scorcher that looked likely to give his side a vital victory in their battle to pull clear of danger.  \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to come away with a point, Spurs have some really exciting young talent, I have seen them beat Real Madrid here, beat teams by four or five,\u201d Moyes said.  \u201cSpurs had so many chances but there is another side to football if you haven\u2019t got the best players.\u201d  The draw left Tottenham in fifth place, three points behind Liverpool in the battle for Champions League qualification, while West Ham edged up to 15th spot, two points above the drop zone, after one losing only once in their last seven league games.  Both sides had played 48 hours before and fatigue showed at times on a rainy night at Tottenham\u2019s temporary home.  For all their territorial domination Tottenham\u2019s end product was lacking with top scorer Harry Kane guilty of missing a gilt-edged chance from Serge Aurier\u2019s knock-down in the first half.  Adrian rescued his side seconds before halftime with an acrobatic save to keep out Christian Eriksen\u2019s deflected shot.  The pattern continued in the second half with Kane, who has scored seven times in previous clashes with West Ham, Dele Alli and Eriksen peppering the West Ham goal.  A scrappy affair was heading for stalemate before the two astonishing late strikes gave the fans something to remember.  Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Ed Osmond"

          "title": "We are still miles away, says West Ham boss Moyes",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - West Ham United manager David Moyes said his side were still \u201cmiles away\u201d from where he wants them to be despite a gritty 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur that edged them away from the Premier League\u2019s basement on Thursday.  Since replacing sacked Slaven Bilic in November with the Hammers in dire relegation trouble, West Ham have improved markedly and have suffered one defeat in their last seven games.  While they are hardly playing the kind of football West Ham fans historically crave, they have beaten champions Chelsea, drawn with Arsenal and held a Tottenham side who had rattled in 12 goals in their last three home games at Wembley.  His side rode their luck on Thursday but took a 70th-minute lead through Pedro Obiang\u2019s screamer, only for Son Heung-min to deny them a smash-and-grab victory that would have taken them four points clear of the relegation zone.  \u201cTo come here and get a point after what we did two days ago is a great effort,\u201d Moyes, whose side beat West Bromwich Albion with a stoppage time winner on Tuesday, told reporters.  \u201cWe\u2019re miles away from how I want us to play but we are doing some things right.  \u201cWe are defending well which gives us a chance against the top teams. I want the players to look up the table.\u201d  West Ham have managed only three shots on target, scoring two of them, in the four London derbies they have played under Moyes, but have become far tougher defensively.  They are now 15th, two points above the relegation zone, and Moyes hopes that he can strengthen his squad in the transfer window.  \u201cWe need a lot in the transfer window but if I can get one or two I\u2019ll be happy,\u201d the former Everton and Manchester United manager said.  Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said it had just been one of those nights and refused to blame a schedule that forced both teams to play their second match in 48 hours.  His side had 70 percent of the ball and 31 attempts at goal to West Ham\u2019s three but could easily have suffered their second defeat against West Ham this season having been knocked out of the League Cup at Wembley in October.  \u201cThe team was fresh and focused, it wasn\u2019t because of two games in 48 hours,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe have different options to score, we tried different ways, we dominated but sometimes you don\u2019t get what you deserve. You need some luck to score.  \u201cWest Ham defended properly.\u201d  Tottenham remained in fifth spot, three points behind Liverpool in the battle for a Champions League spot.

Iovine is best known as the co-founder of Interscope Records, a rap music pioneer that branched out to include artists like Lady Gaga and U2.  Iovine's departure is likely timed to his Apple shares fully vesting, according to the report.

          "body": "(Adds details on financing plans, issuance)  BUENOS AIRES, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Argentina sold $9 billion in a three-part dollar bond issuance that was oversubscribed on Thursday, covering nearly a third of its expected financing needs for 2018 early in the year.  Latin America\u2019s third largest economy sold $1.75 billion in five-year bonds at a yield of 4.625 percent, $4.25 billion of 10-year bonds at 6 percent and $3 billion in 30-year bonds at 7 percent, the ministry said. It said the yields were the lowest in Argentina\u2019s history.  The bonds were 2.4 times oversubscribed, as Argentina received orders for $21.4 billion, the ministry said. It said the issuance would cover half of planned infrastructure investments this year.  Argentina\u2019s Finance Minister Luis Caputo said in late December the country would have to finance an estimated $30 billion in 2018. A finance ministry spokeswoman said on Thursday of this amount $15 billion would likely be international. Argentina is also evaluating a sale in Brazilian reais, she said.  Argentina has aggressively returned to international debt markets since President Mauricio Macri was elected president in late 2015. He settled a dispute with holdout creditors that had locked Argentina out of capital markets for more than a decade.  Earlier on Thursday, Argentina raised the maximum amount of foreign debt it could issue in 2018 by up to the equivalent of $15 billion, after filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Including foreign debt it was authorized to sell last year but did not, total issuances abroad in 2018 could legally be up to $21.6 billion.  Argentina finalized its 2017 foreign bond sale plan by selling 2.75 billion euros ($3.21 billion). That brought the total amount of bonds sold to around $13.4 billion, higher than the $12.75 billion in issuance Caputo had said the country was targeting in June.  Argentina had been authorized to sell $20 billion in bonds in 2017. (Reporting by Caroline Stauffer and Maximilian Rizzi; Editing by Sandra Maler and Lisa Shumaker)"

          "title": "Brookfield Business Partners to buy Westinghouse for $4.6 billion",
          "body": "(Reuters) - A subsidiary of Canada\u2019s Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) (BAM.N) plans to acquire Westinghouse Electric Co LLC, the bankrupt nuclear services company owned by Toshiba Corp (6502.T), for $4.6 billion.  Brookfield Business Partners LP (BBU.N) (BBU_u.TO) said in a statement on Thursday that it and institutional partners would use $1 billion of equity and $3 billion of long-term debt financing to buy the Pittsburgh-based business, its first investment in nuclear power.  The buyers are also assuming Westinghouse\u2019s underfunded pension plan.  New York-listed shares of Brookfield Business Partners were up 3.4 percent in afternoon trading.  The deal is expected to close in the third quarter but will require approval from regulators and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.   Westinghouse has said it is aiming to exit bankruptcy as soon as March, which would allow Toshiba to book tax benefits in the current fiscal year.  \u201cBrookfield\u2019s acquisition of Westinghouse reaffirms our position as the leader of the global nuclear industry,\u201d said Westinghouse Chief Executive Officer Jos\u00e9 Emeterio Guti\u00e9rrez.  Toshiba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The Brookfield group of companies is among the world\u2019s largest investors in stable, long-lived assets such as utilities, real estate, energy and infrastructure.   \u201cAcquiring Westinghouse definitely fits the risk approach they have,\u201d said Mycle Schneider, an energy and nuclear policy consultant in Paris. \u201cThey buy assets in shaky situations.\u201d  Last year Brookfield Asset Management acquired control of two owners of renewable energy projects, TerraForm Global Inc and TerraForm Power Inc (TERP.O), from SunEdison Inc, which had filed for Chapter 11.  In 2016, Brookfield Business Partners converted debt to a large equity stake in a Texas power producer that emerged from Chapter 11 and became Vistra Energy Corp (VST.N). And in November, Brookfield Property Partners BPY.N offered to buy the remaining shares in General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), adding to a large stake it purchased to bring the mall owner out of bankruptcy.  Schneider said he was surprised that Brookfield acquired Westinghouse, given that the company has no other nuclear businesses.  Westinghouse is one the world\u2019s leading suppliers of nuclear fuel, and it provides some form of service to 80 percent of the world\u2019s 450 commercial reactors, according to court records.   Those two business lines generated combined cash flow of $403 million on revenue of about $3.1 billion in Westinghouse\u2019s 2015 financial year, according to court records.  However, the company suffered after it agreed to build two plants in the U.S. Southeast on fixed-price contracts. The project went billions of dollars over budget, and Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in March to escape the contracts.   Construction of new nuclear power plants globally has dropped to the lowest level in a decade following renewed safety concerns after the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.  One of Westinghouse\u2019s unfinished U.S. projects, known as Vogtle in Georgia, will continue with Southern Co (SO.N) replacing the company as the project manager. A South Carolina project known as V.C. Summer was abandoned in July.  The lead utility behind the V.C. Summer project, Scana Corp (SCG.N), agreed on Wednesday to a $7.9 billion takeover bid from Dominion Energy Inc (D.N).  Westinghouse has joined a consortium bidding to provide nuclear power in Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest new markets in the world. Bringing Westinghouse out of bankruptcy could help close a proposed deal for six of the company\u2019s new AP1000 reactors in India.

          "title": "'Bomb cyclone' hits U.S. East Coast energy, power supply",
          "body": "NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A severe winter storm froze pipes and disrupted services at refineries on the U.S. Atlantic coast on Thursday, sending fuel prices higher as heavy snowfall and high winds caused electricity outages for almost 80,000 homes and businesses.  The only nuclear plant in Massachusetts was shut just after 2 p.m. because of the failure of a line that connects the reactor to the power grid. Entergy Corp (ETR.N), which operates the Pilgrim Station, said it had not identified the cause of the line problem. ISO New England, which operates the region\u2019s power grid, attributed the shutdown to blizzard conditions. The company did not say when the station would restart.  Utilities in the Southeast have restored service to some  customers who were hit by the storm overnight.  Heavy snow pounded the East Coast from Maine as far south as North Carolina on Thursday, taking out power lines, icing  roadways and closing schools.   The storm was powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters referred to as bombogenesis or a \u201cbomb cyclone,\u201d which brought high winds and swift, heavy snowfall.   The region has also been in the grip of a prolonged cold spell.   Prices for heating oil HO-NYH HO-DIFF-NYH and natural gas in the U.S. Northeast hit their highest levels in years on the back of near-record heating demand. Benchmark U.S. heating oil futures HOc1 are near their highest in almost three years.   The U.S. average home residential heating oil prices rose  5.4 percent to $3.078 a gallon in the week through Jan. 1 from a week earlier, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. On the East Coast, prices rose 5.4 percent to $3.085 a gallon.    U.S. average residential heating oil prices for the 2017-18 period are well above the 2016-17 levels, the data showed.   U.S. natural gas demand was expected to remain near record highs this week. Natural gas is the major fuel for residential and commercial heating in the U.S. Northeast and is also widely used by power plants.   On Thursday, natural gas futures NGc1 fell 12.8 cents, or 4.3 percent, to settle at $2.880 per million British thermal units. That was the biggest one-day decline for the contract in three weeks as less cold weather was predicted. However, regional prices soared under pressure from the cold snap.   U.S. spot natural gas and power prices on Thursday rose to their highest in years in several regions.   Next-day power prices in New England E-NEPLMHP-IDX and PJM E-PJWHRTP-IX, which covers much of the U.S. mid-Atlantic and Midwest region, rose to their highest since January 2014 due to a spike in local natural gas prices.  New England\u2019s cash prices LNG-CG-BS-SNL soared last week, and remained near four-year highs at $36.32 per mmBtu. ISO-New England, that region\u2019s power grid operator, said on Thursday that its power operators were relying more heavily on generators that burn heating oil due to heavy natural gas demand from homes and businesses.   \u201cWe expect to have sufficient capacity and fuel available and expect to be able to weather the storm without running up against significant emissions limits, but concerns remain the same regarding fuel availability and emissions limits throughout this protracted cold spell and the rest of the winter,\u201d the company said in a statement.  ISO New England spokeswoman Marcia Blomberg said there were \u201cno immediate reliability issues to the local area\u201d due to the shutdown of Pilgrim.   The lights did not go out in New England after the 688 megawatt Pilgrim plant shut because New England, like all U.S. power grids, keeps some generating plants in reserve in case an operating unit unexpectedly shuts. On Thursday, the grid had a reserve of over 2,100 MW. One megawatt is enough to power about 1,000 U.S. homes.  Blomberg added that the loss of Pilgrim \u201cdoes further challenge the region on fuel availability because we need to rely on other generating resources to meet consumer demand and meet overall grid reliability.\u201d  In New York, very few generator outages were reported and there were no problems with a lack of fuel, Wes Yeomans, vice president of Operations at the New York Independent System Operator, said on a call on Thursday.  There are concerns that a significant disruption could lead to a heating oil shortage as distillate inventories, including heating oil, in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions are at their lowest levels for this time of year since 2015.  This has spurred tankers carrying diesel and heating oil to set out from Europe bound for the United States to address supply worries, reversing a traditional trade route.  Icebreakers have been used in ports of Boston, New York and Philadelphia to keep shipping lanes clear, though delays are expected, and the Coast Guard said late on Wednesday that those ships would remain at shore until the storm had passed.      Reliance on heating oil is highest in the Northeast, with about 21 percent of households using oil for space heating.   Most northern U.S. refiners are not reporting problems. Phillips 66 (PSX.N) shut a crude and coking unit at its Wood River, Illinois, refinery after a frozen line and short-lived fire, a source said on Wednesday. It did not have a timeline for restarting the units at the Illinois plant, the source said.      Philadelphia Energy Solutions postponed planned work at its 335,000 refinery complex in Philadelphia until after the storm.   Crude carrier Ridgebury Pioneer, carrying 1.9 million barrels of heavy crude into the Philadelphia area, has been delayed by the storm, according to Reuters Eikon shipping data and two sources familiar with the delivery.

          "title": "Samsung Elec on track for record fourth quarter earnings",
          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) is expected on Tuesday to forecast a record quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, as a world hungry for processing power and high-tech smartphones snaps up its semiconductors and screens.  While a stronger won and falling NAND chip prices could take some shine off the performance, most analysts are tipping a strong quarter for the world\u2019s leading maker of semiconductors, smartphones and televisions.   The South Korean technology giant is expected to forecast a 74 percent year-on-year jump in operating profit in the October-December period to 16 trillion won ($15 billion), according to a Thomson Reuters survey of 16 analysts.  The company will issue earnings guidance on Tuesday ahead of full details on its performance later in January.  \u201cSamsung\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings outlook is lower than initially expected, but it\u2019s mainly due to one-off costs. We remain positive as there\u2019s no notable change in DRAM market dynamics,\u201d said Lee Soon-hak, analyst at Hanwha Investment & Securities.    Samsung Electronics shares closed at 2.554 million won on Thursday, a 11 percent drop from its all-time high of 2.876 million won in early November.   The stock fell sharply in late November after Morgan Stanley forecast that a down-cycle in NAND flash chips had started, ending a prolonged boom.

          "body": "(Adds New England operating reserves)  Jan 4 (Reuters) - Entergy Corp said on Thursday it shut its 688-megawatt Pilgrim nuclear power plant in eastern Massachusetts because of the failure of one of the two lines that connect the reactor to the New England electric grid.  The outage occurred during a winter storm that tested the power grid\u2019s ability to keep the lights on as homes and businesses used most of the region\u2019s natural gas supplies for heating, leaving less of the fuel available for power generation.  \u201cThere are no immediate reliability issues to the local area\u201d after the shutdown of Pilgrim, said Marcia Blomberg, a spokeswoman at ISO New England, which operates the region\u2019s power grid.  The lights did not go out in New England after Pilgrim shut because New England, like all U.S. power grids, keeps some generating plants in reserve in case an operating unit shuts unexpectedly. On Thursday, the grid had a reserve of over 2,100 MW. One megawatt is enough to power about 1,000 U.S. homes.  Blomberg said, however, that the loss of Pilgrim \u201cdoes further challenge the region on fuel availability because we need to rely on other generating resources to meet consumer demand and meet overall grid reliability.\u201d  The region, which usually gets about half of its power from gas-fired generators, was already receiving more electricity from oil-fired units instead of gas.  Blomberg said Pilgrim shut Thursday afternoon \u201cdue to storm conditions.\u201d  Entergy spokesman Patrick O\u2019Brien said the company was \u201cworking to determine the cause of the line loss, noting the plant had been operating safely for 227 days following the completion of its most recent refueling outage in May 2017.  \u201cWe will take this opportunity to conduct preventive maintenance that we could not otherwise perform with the plant operating at full power,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) is expected on Tuesday to forecast a record quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, as a world hungry for processing power and high-tech smartphones snaps up its semiconductors and screens.  While a stronger won and falling NAND chip prices could take some shine off the performance, most analysts are tipping a strong quarter for the world\u2019s leading maker of semiconductors, smartphones and televisions.   The South Korean technology giant is expected to forecast a 74 percent year-on-year jump in operating profit in the October-December period to 16 trillion won ($15 billion), according to a Thomson Reuters survey of 16 analysts.  The company will issue earnings guidance on Tuesday ahead of full details on its performance later in January.  \u201cSamsung\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings outlook is lower than initially expected, but it\u2019s mainly due to one-off costs. We remain positive as there\u2019s no notable change in DRAM market dynamics,\u201d said Lee Soon-hak, analyst at Hanwha Investment & Securities.    Samsung Electronics shares closed at 2.554 million won on Thursday, a 11 percent drop from its all-time high of 2.876 million won in early November.   The stock fell sharply in late November after Morgan Stanley forecast that a down-cycle in NAND flash chips had started, ending a prolonged boom.   However, analysts say the continued rise of DRAM chip prices in the fourth quarter has more than made up for that, and many are forecasting DRAM supply to remain tight throughout 2018 as companies expand data centers.

          "title": "Trump credits his firmness for potential Korea talks, signals Olympic concession",
          "body": "WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called potential talks between North and South Korea \u201ca good thing\u201d and agreed with South Korea there would be no joint military drills, which North Korea bitterly opposes, during next month\u2019s Winter Olympics.  South Korea\u2019s Presidential Blue House said Trump told South Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-in in a telephone call he hoped inter-Korean talks would lead to good results and that he would send a high-level delegation, including members of his family, to the Winter Olympics, which will be held in South Korea.  A senior U.S. administration official told Reuters there had been discussion about Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka attending the games in Pyeongchang.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this but said Trump and Moon agreed \u201cto de-conflict the Olympics and our military exercises\u201d to ensure the security of the games and that a \u201chigh-level delegation\u201d would attend.  At the same time, the two leaders also \u201cagreed to continue the campaign of maximum pressure against North Korea,\u201d it added.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters the joint drills, which North Korea denounces as a prelude to invasion, would now take place sometime after the Olympics and Paralympics, which run from Feb. 9-25 and March 9-18. Mattis called their delay a \u201cpractical\u201d matter.  Mattis said it was too early to say if North Korea\u2019s offer to talk to South Korea was a genuine olive branch, but said it was clearly the result of international pressure.   In a tweet earlier, Trump, who hurled fresh insults at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this week, took credit for any dialogue.  \u201cDoes anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn\u2019t firm, strong and willing to commit our total \u2018might\u2019 against the North,\u201d Trump tweeted, adding that \u201ctalks are a good thing!\u201d  Washington had earlier responded coolly to Kim\u2019s suggestion of inter-Korean talks in a New Year\u2019s Day message, with the State Department saying Pyongyang \u201cmight be trying to drive a wedge\u201d between Washington and Seoul.  The head of U.S. forces in South Korea warned on Thursday against raising hopes over North Korea\u2019s overture amid a war of words over Pyongyang\u2019s development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.  Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim have exchanged bellicose comments in recent months, raising alarm across the world, with Trump at times dismissing the prospect of a diplomatic solution to a crisis in which both sides have threatened to destroy each other.  In his New Year address, Kim said he was open to dialogue with South Korea and could send a delegation to the Winter Olympics.  Kim also warned he would push ahead with \u201cmass producing\u201d nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions and warned that the entire United States was in range of North Korean nuclear missiles and a nuclear button was always on his desk.  Trump responded by mocking Kim as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and saying that his nuclear button was bigger and more powerful and worked.  Seoul answered the North Korean talks overture by proposing high-level talks at a border village next week and on Wednesday, the two Koreas reopened a border hotline that had been closed since February 2016.  The senior administration official said that despite Trump\u2019s positive words, there was concern in the administration that South Korea could go too far in offering concessions to North Korea that could weaken the U.S. pressure campaign.  \u201cI don\u2019t think people view the talks as an unalloyed good, that under all circumstances North and South talking is a good thing,\u201d the official said.  \u201cI think we have seen in the past that sometimes the North exploits these talks, especially when you have a left-of-center president in South Korea whose base is encouraging him to make concessions that we probably would not be comfortable with.\u201d  \u201cSo there\u2019s a level of wariness about that.\u201d  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said she understood any talks would be limited to the Olympics and domestic issues and added that Washington and Seoul were in close contact.  \u201cThis is not something where (South Korea) is going to go off freelancing,\u201d she said. \u201cCould that meeting that could potentially happen ... lead to something more in the future? Perhaps it could but I don\u2019t want to speculate.\u201d   On Tuesday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not contribute to denuclearizing North Korea.  She also said Washington was hearing reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile and warned of even tougher steps in response if it did so.  The commander of U.S. Forces Korea, General Vincent Brooks, said the North Korean overture was a strategy to divide five countries - the United States, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia - to reach its goal of being accepted as a \u201cnuclear capable\u201d nation, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency reported.  \u201cWe must keep our expectations at the appropriate level,\u201d he was quoted as saying in an address to a university in Seoul,\u201d he said, adding it was important for the United States and South Korea to maintain an \u201cironclad and razor-sharp\u201d alliance.  The five countries Brooks mentioned were involved in years of on-again-off-again \u201csix-party talks\u201d with North Korea aimed at resolving the crisis, but eventually North Korea pulled out.

Kazakhstan is the Security Council president through January.   U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said this week that Washington was seeking emergency sessions on Iran at the United Nations in New York and at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. The U.S. delegation said on Thursday it had requested the Friday meeting.  Anti-government protests have swept Iranian cities and towns over the past week and 21 people have been killed in the unrest.

          "body": "Jan 4 (Reuters) - California\u2019s insurance regulator wants a new state law to stop insurers dropping homeowner coverage due to wildfire risk by making them change computer models to factor in efforts to prevent blazes from spreading.  California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones issued a report on Thursday describing how more frequent and ferocious California wildfires are restricting the availability and affordability of homeowners\u2019 insurance in the state.  Massive, out-of-season fires in California during 2017 caused billions of dollars in claims and are challenging expectations of when and where to expect blazes. State law gives insurers more leeway to drop coverage than to raise rates, and some have been taking the opportunity to not renew policies, a trend concerning Jones.  The California Department of Insurance lacks authority to regulate how insurers underwrite property insurance, a problem the state\u2019s legislature must fix, Jones said.  He unveiled legislative proposals to change computer models that homeowner insurers rely on for house-by-house predictions of risk, now using factors such as local topography and brush cover. Jones wants to require the models to include wildfire mitigation efforts, such as homeowner or community efforts to clear brush, according to the report.  \u201cThere are no specific statutory standards in place to ensure the models\u2019 accuracy or reliability in rating and underwriting of homeowners\u2019 insurance,\u201d Jones said in the report.  Jones also wants homeowners to be able to appeal the risk scores that models generate which insurers use to make coverage decisions.  It was unclear whether legislators would take up Jones\u2019 proposals, but at least one California lawmaker has suggested that insurers give discounts when homeowners reduce their wildfire risks.  \u201cWe look forward to reviewing Commissioner Jones\u2019 recommendations and working with him and other policymakers to address wildfire safety and recovery efforts, while balancing the need to remain solvent and pay future claims,\u201d said Mark Sektnan, vice president of state government relations for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.  Homeowners can already appeal risk scores by talking to insurers who, in turn, can ask risk modeling companies to review the property again, said Janet Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the industry\u2019s Insurance Information Institute.  The 2017 wildfires will not change Allstate Corp\u2019s underwriting in the state, said the insurer\u2019s chief executive officer, Tom Wilson, in an unrelated interview on Thursday. Allstate already scaled back its wildfire exposure four to five years ago, said Wilson.  \u201cBut you do have to make sure over time that you\u2019re collecting the  proper amount of money for that,\u201d Wilson said.

The UAE had not commented publicly on the issue until Thursday, except for a tweet by its minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, which said both countries had been in contact about \u201csecurity measure information\u201d, adding that his country valued and respected Tunisian women.

          "title": "Senator Gillibrand raises concerns about interim Manhattan U.S. attorney",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said on Thursday she opposed the possible nomination of Manhattan\u2019s interim top federal prosecutor, Geoffrey Berman, to permanently fill the post, citing concerns over his independence from President Donald Trump.   Gillibrand, the junior U.S. senator from New York, said in an emailed statement to Reuters that she found \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d reports the president personally interviewed Berman for the post of Manhattan U.S. attorney, whose jurisdiction includes Trump\u2019s home, offices and real estate holdings in New York.  \u201cIf this meeting took place it shows a lack of judgment that (Gillibrand) believes her colleagues should view as disqualifying as a nominee,\u201d the statement said. Gillibrand said it was especially troubling in light of reports that Trump had asked former FBI director James Comey for a pledge of loyalty in a one-on-one meeting.  Politico and other media outlets reported in October that Berman and at least two other candidates for U.S. attorney were personally interviewed by Trump. Presidents have not typically met with U.S. attorney nominees, and some Democrats have suggested it was inappropriate from Trump to do so, especially for the Manhattan position.   The Manhattan U.S. attorney is one of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement posts, well known for terrorism cases and prosecutions of Wall Street financial crimes and government corruption  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has not denied that the interviews took place. Other former government lawyers from both parties have said they would not have been improper on their face.  Berman, who was a member of Trump\u2019s transition team, was sworn in on Thursday as one of 17 interim U.S. attorneys appointed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to serve in jurisdictions around the country.   The interim posts are for 120 days unless those holding them are re-appointed by a court or officially nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.  The statement from Gillibrand is potentially significant because she could try to block Berman\u2019s nomination through the \u201cblue slip\u201d process by which senators have traditionally held veto power over nominees in their home state.  Chuck Schumer, the senior senator from New York and also a Democrat, did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.  Berman, who was an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan from 1990 to 1994, was a partner at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, another supporter of Trump\u2019s presidential run in 2016, practices at the same firm.  Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, tweeted his disapproval of Berman on Tuesday. \u201cTrump\u2019s appointment of a prosecutor - after a personal interview - who may well be prosecuting him is absolutely abhorrent to the rule of law,\u201d he wrote.  New York lawyer Robert Fiske, who served as Manhattan U.S. attorney from 1976 to 1980 and worked with Berman early in Berman\u2019s career, called the concerns about the meeting a \u201cred herring\u201d and said the president was entitled to meet with someone he was going to nominate.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Any lawsuits by President Donald Trump against former chief strategist Steve Bannon or the author and publisher of a book depicting a chaotic White House and Trump as out of his depth would almost certainly fail and could lead to more damaging disclosures, legal experts said.   Trump threatened legal action against Bannon over \u201clibelous\u201d remarks quoted by writer Michael Wolff in the book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\u201d after excerpts were published by media outlets on Wednesday. Charles Harder, a lawyer for the president, told Reuters that he would take \u201clegal action\u201d to block the book\u2019s release. He sent  cease-and-desist letters to Bannon, Wolff and publisher Henry Holt & Co.  Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus law professor at Harvard Law School, said a libel lawsuit by Trump would be a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d and \u201ca nonstarter\u201d that \u201cno reasonable lawyer would recommend.\u201d  Dershowitz, who has often publicly defended the legality of the president\u2019s actions over the past year, said it is very difficult for public figures to prevail in libel suits. Trump would need to show Wolff and publisher Holt knew statements by Bannon and others were false or they acted with reckless disregard for whether or not they were true.  In the book, Bannon was quoted describing as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic\u201d a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting Donald Trump Jr. and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner held with a group of Russians who had promised damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.  Bannon has not responded to requests for comment.  Trump Jr. and Kushner have not commented on the quotes.   Elsewhere in the book, Wolff in his own voice describes Trump as \u201cno more than semi-literate\u201d in terms of his reading habits and being known among his social circle for having a \u201cwide-ranging ignorance.\u201d  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders described the book as  \u201csome trash\u201d filled with \u201cmistake after mistake.\u201d  The publisher defended the book.   \u201cWe see \u2018Fire and Fury\u2019 as an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse, and are proceeding with the publication of the book,\u201d Holt said in a statement.  Holt on Thursday moved up the book\u2019s release to Jan. 5 from the original publication date of Jan. 9.  Some lawyers said Bannon, Wolff and the publisher could all argue that many of the comments in the book were opinions, which are protected by the First Amendment and cannot be the basis of a libel action. Andrew Wright, a former associate counsel in the Obama White House and professor at Savannah Law School, said that would include Bannon\u2019s \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic\u201d quotes.  \u201cI don\u2019t think Bannon would have a hard time establishing that he meant it as an opinion that it was disloyal and improper rather than as a statement of law,\u201d said Wright.  In one letter to Bannon and another to both Wolff and Steve Rubin, President & Publisher, Henry Holt and Company, Harder also said Bannon violated non-disclosure and non-disparagement provisions of his employment agreement with the Trump 2016 election campaign by speaking with Wolff. He said Wolff and Holt could face claims of interfering with or inducing breach of that contract.   But legal experts said the employment agreement would not have applied to Bannon after he joined the White House staff.  Because of transparency and free speech concerns, the government has far less power to limit non-classified speech by employees than private companies, said Bradley Moss, a Washington lawyer specializing in national security law.   Apart from facing long odds, a Trump libel lawsuit would also force the president to participate in an intrusive disclosure process.  Dershowitz said that defense lawyers would be able to subject Trump to \u201cbroad and far-ranging\u201d depositions about \u201calmost anything\u201d and compel him to answer.  Moss said defense lawyers would also be entitled to interview White House officials and collect potentially damaging documents from them. \u201cIt would be one more distraction, one more thing people in the administration need to hire lawyers for.\u201d  Trump has a history of threatening lawsuits in his real estate business career and during his election campaign, though he has not always followed through. In the campaign, he threatened to sue the New York Times over its reporting that he made unwanted advances on two women.   Then-Republican candidate Trump was accused by 13 women who publicly said that in the past he had physically touched them inappropriately in some way. He said he would sue all of the women, calling them liars, but those lawsuits have not been filed.  Reporting by Jan Wolfe; Editing by Anthony Lin and Grant McCool"

          "title": "Intel shares fall as investors worry about costs of chip flaw",
          "body": "(Reuters. - Intel Corp shares fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday as investors worried about the potential financial liability and reputational hit from recently disclosed security flaws in its widely used microprocessors.   The largest chipmaker had confirmed on Wednesday that flaws reported by researchers could allow hackers to steal sensitive information from computers, phones and other devices. Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and other software makers have issued patches to protect against the vulnerabilities.  Intel may be on the hook for costs stemming from lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers will likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make, security experts said.   \u201cThe potential liability is big for Intel,\u201d said Eric Johnson, dean of Vanderbilt University\u2019s Owen Graduate School of Management. \u201cEverybody will be scrambling over the next few days to figure out just how big it is.\u201d   Intel has said that the patches for the bugs would slow its chips down somewhat but that most users will not notice.   Amazon Web Services (AWS), the largest seller of cloud computing services, said in a statement it does not \u201cexpect meaningful performance impact for most customer workloads.\u201d  Microsoft and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google both said in statements on their websites that they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers.  But the incident is likely to spur cloud companies to press Intel for lower prices on chips in future talks, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, which owns shares in Intel.   \u201cWhat (Intel\u2019s cloud customers) are going to say is, \u2018You wronged us, we hate you, but if we can get a discount, we\u2019ll still buy from you,\u2019\u201d  Forrest said.   Forrest also expects Intel will have to increase its chip development spending to focus on security.   Government agencies and security experts said they knew of no cyber attacks that had exploited the vulnerabilities.  Financial services firms were studying information on the vulnerabilities to determine how to best respond, said the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a global industry group known as FS-ISAC that shares data on cyber threats.  Banks and other firms are trying to understand what it will cost to respond to the issue, FS-ISAC said in an emailed statement.  \u201cIn addition to the security considerations raised by this design flaw, performance degradation is expected, which could require more processing power for affected systems to compensate and maintain current baseline performance,\u201d FS-ISAC said. \u201cThere will need to be consideration and balance between fixing the potential security threat vs the performance and other possible impact to systems.\u201d   Lawyers filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California, federal court on Wednesday that sought class action status and compensation for people who had bought vulnerable Intel chips or computers that came with them already installed.   Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the lawsuit.   While more lawsuits are expected, Intel\u2019s biggest customers are likely to quietly seek compensation for any harm caused by the vulnerabilities, including costs to patch machines or replace microprocessors, Johnson said.  Legal experts said that consumers would have to prove concrete damages and harm to proceed with claims.   Intel shares fell 1.8 percent, following a 3.4 percent decline Wednesday.   Shares in rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc climbed 4.9 percent as investors speculated the No. 2 maker of microprocessors would woo customers away from Intel.   Still, researchers had said some of AMD\u2019s chips had one of the two vulnerabilities disclosed on Wednesday, as do processors from ARM Holdings.

          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) said on Thursday it was shuttering 103 unprofitable Kmart and Sears stores as it continues to streamline operations amid mounting debt and a string of quarterly losses.  The department store operator, which has racked up 24 straight quarters of sales declines, said 64 Kmart stores and 39 Sears stores would be closed between early March and early April this year.  Sears Holdings, once the largest retailer in the United States, said at the end of October that it operated 1,104 stores, nearly half the 2,019 stores it ran in 2012.  The closures announced on Thursday were in addition to 63 stores Sears is closing this month, having also shuttered 330 stores in 2017.  Shares in Sears closed down 4.8 percent on Thursday.  Liquidation sales will begin as early as Jan. 12 at the closing stores, Sears said, adding that \u201celigible\u201d staff at these stores would receive severance.   Company spokesman Chris Brathwaite declined to disclose the number of jobs that would be cut, but said an overwhelming majority of them were part-time positions. He added that only full-time employees typically received severance packages, but that this would vary depending on local laws.  Sears\u2019 billionaire chief executive and biggest shareholder Eddie Lampert said in July that some vendors had reduced their support, placing additional pressure on operations. In October, Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N), one of Sears\u2019 biggest vendors, said it would stop supplying some big name-brand appliances to the department store chain.  Lampert is also among Sears\u2019 biggest lenders through his hedge fund, ESL Investments.  Reporting by Richa Naidu; Editing by Tom Brown and David Gregorio"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow industrials broke above the 25,000 level for the first time on Thursday and other major indexes hit closing record highs again, propelled by strong global economic data that extended the New Year\u2019s rally for the stock market.  The 30-member blue-chip index crossed five 1,000-point marks in 2017 on solid corporate earnings and hopes for a pro-growth agenda by U.S. President Donald Trump.  It took less than a year for the Dow to add a 5,000-point milestone, which is the fastest since the index was created in May 1896.  Wall Street has started 2018 on a strong note. The benchmark S&P index closed above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settled above 7,000 a day earlier. Both indexes also registered closing record highs on Thursday.  Strong manufacturing and services sector data from the world\u2019s largest economies provided a bullish tone on Thursday, while other data showed U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December. Friday will bring the key U.S. non-farm payrolls report.  \u201cThere are expectations we will see volatility creep back into the market and pull this market down,\u201d at some point this year, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  \u201cBut as long as you have economic growth and earnings moving higher... there\u2019s still a solid underpinning,\u201d she said. The rally shows \u201cinvestors are expecting conditions to remain solid at least in the initial couple of months.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 152.45 points, or 0.61 percent, to 25,075.13, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 10.93 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,723.99 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 12.38 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,077.92.  The Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, better known as the VIX and a popular options-based gauge of expected near-term price volatility, closed at 9.22. The index has been flirting with record lows in recent months.   Financials led gains on the S&P 500 on Thursday, with Wells Fargo (WFC.N) up 1.3 percent, JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) up 1.4 percent and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) also up 1.4 percent.  Credit Suisse raised its price targets on six banks, while Goldman Sachs also had a bullish note on U.S. bank stocks.  \u201cThere were very positive notes on the banks today, so that set the tone for the group,\u201d said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York.  \u00a0\u00a0  \u201cAs we head into earnings, a lot of people will take a break. The banks are well owned.\u201d  S&P 500 companies are expected to soon begin reporting quarterly earnings, with JPMorgan results due next week.  On the downside, Victoria\u2019s Secret owner L Brands (LB.N) slid 12.3 percent after a disappointing quarterly earnings forecast.  Macy\u2019s (M.N) fell 3.3 percent after it reported only modest growth in holiday sales and saying it would close stores and slash thousands of jobs this year. Other department store operators also fell.  Intel Corp (INTC.O) was down 1.8 percent, adding to Wednesday\u2019s losses, as investors worried about the potential financial liability from recently disclosed security flaws in its microprocessors. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) rose 4.9 percent.   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.46-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  Volume held up despite a powerful blizzard that caused power outages and travel problems in the U.S. Northeast, and walloped New York City with snow.  About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

          "title": "Trump, lawmakers step up talks on immigrant 'Dreamers'",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Urgent negotiations aimed at shielding young, undocumented immigrants from deportation intensified on Thursday as Republican U.S. senators emerged from a meeting with President Donald Trump expressing confidence a deal could be struck this month.  As a follow-up to the Republican-only talks on so-called \u201cDreamer\u201d immigrants, Trump is inviting senators from both major parties to the White House next week. Some senators told reporters the aim was to hold the meeting on Tuesday.  \u201cNext week the president is inviting a bipartisan group of senators to the White House to discuss the next steps on responsible immigration reform,\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.  For at least the past four months, Democratic and Republican senators have been meeting behind closed doors to try to fashion legislation that would protect at least 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought into the United States as children.  \u201cI think we\u2019re narrowing the differences,\u201d Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters.  Even with evidence of progress, there were difficulties ahead.  Republicans continued to push for reigning in \u201cchain migration\u201d that could jeopardize the parents of Dreamers who are still in the United States illegally. And whatever deal that is cobbled together in the Senate could face opposition from hard-liners in the House of Representatives.  Some House Republicans have been clamoring to use Dreamer legislation to attach additional money for immigration enforcement throughout the country, which immigration advocacy groups fear would be used to go after the relatives of the young immigrants.  Many of these Dreamers are from Mexico and Central America and have spent most of their lives in the United States, attending school and participating in American society despite their illegal status.  Trump put their fates in doubt in early September when he announced he was ending Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which allowed the youth to legally live and work in the United States temporarily.  Unless the Republican-controlled Congress and Trump can agree on a legislative replacement, these immigrants will be subject to deportation at the beginning of March. For many, their protections already have expired.  Senator Thom Tillis, one of a handful of Republican senators who met with Trump on Thursday, returned to Capitol Hill saying it was possible a bill could hit the Senate floor later this month.  \u201cI think so. I think if people get serious about it and start focusing and get in the room together. ... I think we\u2019ll see progress next week,\u201d Tillis told reporters.  Republican Senator James Lankford expressed hope that at next week\u2019s bipartisan meeting Trump will produce a document that specifically lays out his administration\u2019s demands for additional border security measures and other immigration law changes to accompany the new protections for Dreamers.  Trump and congressional Republicans have insisted on tougher border security, especially along the southwestern border with Mexico. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer reiterated that Democrats also want \u201cstrong and real border security.\u201d  Lankford said that a $1.6 billion injection of additional border security funds for next year was under discussion - a number that Democrats have embraced for more electronic surveillance, drone flights and other high-tech enhancements.  They have steadfastly opposed Trump\u2019s call for building a southwestern border wall.

          "body": "WELLINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A huge storm battered New Zealand\u2019s North Island on Friday,  leaving tens of thousands of homes without power and forcing evacuations in low-lying areas. The county\u2019s official meteorology service said the storm, which began on Thursday, would continue to cause havoc as it moved south towards the capital, Wellington.  New Zealand\u2019s largest city, Auckland, was pummelled by two months\u2019 worth of rain in 24 hours, according to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, prompting authorities to shut major roads and cancel ferry services.  In Kaiaua, a seaside town south of Auckland, local authorities called for residents to immediately evacuate on Friday morning as strong tides submerged land along the coast.  Winds of up to 128 kilometres (79.5 miles) an hour tore off roofs, felled trees and ripped boats from their moorings overnight, according to local media.  More than 20,000 households had been left without power, including 12,000 in Auckland, according to the New Zealand Herald newspaper.  Electricity providers said they were working to urgently fix dozens of separate power outages centering around Auckland.  Air New Zealand said on Twitter that flights could be affected by the bad weather across the country.  The storm was a dramatic interlude in an unusually dry summer period, which has led to drought in many of the country\u2019s farming regions and curbed production of milk, New Zealand\u2019s most lucrative goods export.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow industrials broke above the 25,000 level for the first time on Thursday and other major indexes hit closing record highs again, propelled by strong global economic data that extended the New Year\u2019s rally for the stock market.  The 30-member blue-chip index crossed five 1,000-point marks in 2017 on solid corporate earnings and hopes for a pro-growth agenda by U.S. President Donald Trump.  It took less than a year for the Dow to add a 5,000-point milestone, which is the fastest since the index was created in May 1896.  Wall Street has started 2018 on a strong note. The benchmark S&P index closed above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settled above 7,000 a day earlier. Both indexes also registered closing record highs on Thursday.  Strong manufacturing and services sector data from the world\u2019s largest economies provided a bullish tone on Thursday, while other data showed U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December. Friday will bring the key U.S. non-farm payrolls report.  \u201cThere are expectations we will see volatility creep back into the market and pull this market down,\u201d at some point this year, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  \u201cBut as long as you have economic growth and earnings moving higher... there\u2019s still a solid underpinning,\u201d she said. The rally shows \u201cinvestors are expecting conditions to remain solid at least in the initial couple of months.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 152.45 points, or 0.61 percent, to 25,075.13, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 10.93 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,723.99 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 12.38 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,077.92.  The Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, better known as the VIX and a popular options-based gauge of expected near-term price volatility, closed at 9.22. The index has been flirting with record lows in recent months.   Financials led gains on the S&P 500 on Thursday, with Wells Fargo (WFC.N) up 1.3 percent, JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) up 1.4 percent and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) also up 1.4 percent.  Credit Suisse raised its price targets on six banks, while Goldman Sachs also had a bullish note on U.S. bank stocks.  \u201cThere were very positive notes on the banks today, so that set the tone for the group,\u201d said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York.  \u00a0\u00a0  \u201cAs we head into earnings, a lot of people will take a break. The banks are well owned.\u201d  S&P 500 companies are expected to soon begin reporting quarterly earnings, with JPMorgan results due next week.  On the downside, Victoria\u2019s Secret owner L Brands (LB.N) slid 12.3 percent after a disappointing quarterly earnings forecast.  Macy\u2019s (M.N) fell 3.3 percent after it reported only modest growth in holiday sales and saying it would close stores and slash thousands of jobs this year. Other department store operators also fell.  Intel Corp (INTC.O) was down 1.8 percent, adding to Wednesday\u2019s losses, as investors worried about the potential financial liability from recently disclosed security flaws in its microprocessors. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) rose 4.9 percent.   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.46-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  Volume held up despite a powerful blizzard that caused power outages and travel problems in the U.S. Northeast, and walloped New York City with snow.  About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose on Thursday to its highest since May 2015, on concern about supply risks due to unrest in Iran and another decline in U.S. inventories as refining activity hit a 12-year high.  U.S. oil stocks fell more than expected, continuing a steady drawdown of supplies in the world\u2019s largest oil consumer, though stocks of distillates and gasoline rose on heavy refining activity driven in part by year-end adjustments.   However, cold weather across much of the country was expected to keep demand high, as heating oil prices were just off highs not seen since early 2015.  Brent crude LCOc1, the international benchmark, settled up 23 cents at $68.07 a barrel after hitting a high of $68.27 earlier in the session. U.S. crude CLc1 settled up 38 cents at $62.01, after earlier hitting $62.21, its highest since May 2015.  Freezing weather in the United States has boosted demand for heating oil. Heating oil futures were down 0.7 percent to $2.0741 a gallon; the contract hit highs not seen since February 2014 earlier in the week.  U.S. crude stocks USOILC=ECI fell by 7.4 million barrels in the last week of 2017, exceeding expectations, as refiners boosted activity to their highest rate since 2005, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Thursday.  \u201cThe draw was fairly in line with what we\u2019ve seen in the latter half of 2017,\u201d said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky. U.S. crude stocks have dropped more than 78 million barrels since the middle of 2017 to 424.5 million, the lowest since September 2015.  Anti-government protests since last week in Iran, OPEC\u2019s third-largest producer, have added a geopolitical risk premium to oil prices, though the country\u2019s production and exports have not been affected, sources said.   \u201cThe protests don\u2019t put crude oil production at risk; from that perspective it is sort of a moot geopolitical factor,\u201d said Sarp Ozkan, analyst at Drillinginfo.com in Denver.   Apart from a spike in May 2015, oil is at its highest since December 2014 - the month after a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stop cutting output to support prices.  OPEC, supported by Russia and other non-members, began to reduce output a year ago to remove a glut built up in the previous two years. Compliance has been high, as producers have decided to extend the supply pact until the end of 2018.  OPEC\u2019s cuts are helping reduce global inventories, even as production continues to rise in the United States. U.S. production rose to 9.78 million barrels in the last week.

Petrobras on Wednesday agreed to settle a class action lawsuit in the United States that claimed damages for the oil company\u2019s role in a bribery scheme involving company executives and government officials. Petrobras said the settlement was not an admission of guilt and denied any wrongdoing.  \u201cThe voluntary act of Petrobras paying $3 billion to foreign shareholders indicates it should pay proportional values to Brazilian shareholders,\u201d Andre de Almeida, a lawyer leading the shareholder lawsuit in Brazil, told Reuters.  \u201cAfter all, the same facts, the same defendants, should have the same consequence, independent of the jurisdiction of the investment.\u201d  Petrobras declined to comment.  Wednesday\u2019s settlement agreement, which must still be approved by a U.S. court, was one of the largest ever class action settlements in the United States.

(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) executives have voiced support for the Fox television studio\u2019s adult-oriented programming and development is continuing as usual while a proposed merger undergoes regulatory review, Fox executives and producers said Thursday.  In December, Disney announced plans to acquire the Fox TV studio, the FX and National Geographic cable channels and other assets from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) conglomerate.  Fox produces edgy adult comedies such as \u201cFamily Guy\u201d and gory dramas such as \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d that contrast with Disney\u2019s family-friendly movies and TV shows.  Ryan Murphy, producer of several Fox and FX hits including \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d said he received a phone call from Disney CEO Bob Iger and was blunt about his concerns.  \u201cThe stuff that I do is not specifically Disney,\u201d Murphy said he told Iger. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about that. Am I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in \u2018American Horror Story?\u2019\u201d  Iger told him Disney was interested in buying Fox because it believes in its assets, executives and creators, said Murphy, who spoke at a Television Critics Association meeting where networks promote upcoming shows.  Murphy said he will wait to decide whether to keep working with Fox after the merger, but added that he was hopeful about its future. He noted that Iger had successfully integrated Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Entertainment \u201cwhile keeping their communities intact.\u201d   \u201cI\u2019m interested in seeing what that company is going to look like before I decide where to go,\u201d Murphy said.      The deal sparked anxiety among some other producers of Fox shows, said Gary Newman, co-chairman and co-CEO of Fox Television Group. Newman said he met with many producers to assure them it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d during the regulatory review, which is projected to take 12 to 18 months.          \u201cWhen we did hear from Disney management, they were incredibly vocal to us about how much they like our brand, how much they admire the programming we did,\u201d Newman said.  \u201cEvery expectation we have is that they are not acquiring Fox to turn it into some form of a PG company,\u201d he added. \u201cMy expectation is they are going to be encouraging of our content.\u201d  \u201cFamily Guy\u201d creator Seth MacFarlane, who also said he received a call from Iger, shrugged off the pending acquisition. \u201cThis kind of stuff happens often now,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything will change that much.\u201d  Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by David Gregorio"

Am I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in \u2018American Horror Story?\u2019\u201d  Iger told him Disney was interested in buying Fox because it believes in its assets, executives and creators, said Murphy, who spoke at a Television Critics Association meeting where networks promote upcoming shows.  Murphy said he will wait to decide whether to keep working with Fox after the merger, but added that he was hopeful about its future. He noted that Iger had successfully integrated Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Entertainment \u201cwhile keeping their communities intact.\u201d   \u201cI\u2019m interested in seeing what that company is going to look like before I decide where to go,\u201d Murphy said.      The deal sparked anxiety among some other producers of Fox shows, said Gary Newman, co-chairman and co-CEO of Fox Television Group. Newman said he met with many producers to assure them it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d during the regulatory review, which is projected to take 12 to 18 months.          \u201cWhen we did hear from Disney management, they were incredibly vocal to us about how much they like our brand, how much they admire the programming we did,\u201d Newman said.  \u201cEvery expectation we have is that they are not acquiring Fox to turn it into some form of a PG company,\u201d he added. \u201cMy expectation is they are going to be encouraging of our content.\u201d  \u201cFamily Guy\u201d creator Seth MacFarlane, who also said he received a call from Iger, shrugged off the pending acquisition. \u201cThis kind of stuff happens often now,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything will change that much.\u201d  Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by David Gregorio"

          "body": "RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian shareholders of state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) are petitioning a Brazilian court to be paid on similar terms as those given to U.S. shareholders in a $2.95 billion settlement, a lawyer told Reuters on Thursday.  Petrobras on Wednesday agreed to settle a class action lawsuit in the United States that claimed damages for the oil company\u2019s role in a bribery scheme involving company executives and government officials. Petrobras said the settlement was not an admission of guilt and denied any wrongdoing.  \u201cThe voluntary act of Petrobras paying $3 billion to foreign shareholders indicates it should pay proportional values to Brazilian shareholders,\u201d Andre de Almeida, a lawyer leading the shareholder lawsuit in Brazil, told Reuters.  \u201cAfter all, the same facts, the same defendants, should have the same consequence, independent of the jurisdiction of the investment.\u201d  Petrobras declined to comment.  Wednesday\u2019s settlement agreement, which must still be approved by a U.S. court, was one of the largest ever class action settlements in the United States.  For the last four years Brazil has been rocked by the so-called Car Wash investigation into kickbacks from contractors to executives of state-run companies and politicians in return for public projects.

In 2016, New York and Illinois adopted rules to subsidize some reactors in danger of closing  * PSEG has said economic studies show the loss of its plants would result in $400 million a year in higher electricity rates, 14 million tons a year of additional air pollution and the loss of 5,800 or more jobs (Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The red carpet is rolling out, the champagne is on ice and the statuettes are about to be handed over.   But with the cloud of sexual harassment hanging over Hollywood\u2019s annual round of self-congratulations, the Golden Globe ceremony on Sunday marks the first test of how the industry will handle live on the world\u2019s stage a scandal that has rocked show business.  \u201cThis is an issue that is center stage in Hollywood and is playing out at the award shows,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Neil, founder of awards website GoldDerby.com.  Celebrities and filmmakers who were once major players during awards season have been shunned, written out of shows or snubbed in nominations.  Women are planning to wear black on the Golden Globes red carpet to signal support of sexual harassment victims; a major talent agency has canceled its annual Golden Globes party to instead fund legal defense for victims; and the Screen Actors Guild Awards later in January will feature all female presenters.  The mood ahead of the Oscars on March 4 ranges from nervousness to eagerness to take a stand.  \u201cEveryone I have been talking to is relishing the opportunity to make this kind of visibility and attention more meaningful than simply about the glorification of a single profession,\u201d actress Michelle Williams, who is Golden Globe nominated for \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d told Reuters.  More than 30 men have accused Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct and more than 70 women have made allegations against  film producer Harvey Weinstein.  Dustin Hoffman, comedian Louis C.K. and Jeffrey Tambor are among dozens of other celebrities, politicians and businessmen who have been accused of sexual impropriety.  Reuters is unable to independently verify any of the accusations. Weinstein has denied having any non-consensual sex with anyone, Spacey apologized to one of his accusers but was erased from \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d and written out of his TV series \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d  Hoffman and Tambor have denied any wrongdoing. C.K. admitted past misconduct and his movie and TV projects have been dropped.  \u201cI always saw this awards season as a perfect little bubble where everything is magical and beautiful because it\u2019s movies. I think what we\u2019re realizing now is that it has its own issues that it has to work on,\u201d Emily Gordon, screenwriter for movie \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d told Reuters  On Sunday, all eyes will be on Golden Globes host Seth Meyers and how he navigates what is traditionally a boozy celebration and the elephant in the room.  \u201cHe\u2019s got an impossible job. He can\u2019t ignore the hot button issue in Hollywood. He\u2019s expected to lead a jokathon but it\u2019s not a laughing matter,\u201d said O\u2019Neil.  Meyers said on Thursday that he would tackle the issue.  \u201cFingers crossed we meet the right tone but that\u2019s certainly our goal,\u201d he told Reuters Television. \u201cA great thing about the Globes is that people use it as a platform, and I don\u2019t think this year will be any different.\u201d  Hollywood is also at odds with itself. Matt Damon was slammed in December for suggesting that allegations of rape and inappropriate touching should not be conflated. Talk show host James Corden was criticized for joking about Weinstein at a Beverly Hills event in October, and Rose McGowan accused Meryl Streep of remaining silent about Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior. Streep denied the accusation and called for women to unite.  \u201cThis is getting to be a whole internecine battle in Hollywood. I think they are all very nervous,\u201d said Pete Hammond, awards columnist for Deadline.com.  The Golden Globe awards for film and television will be televised live from Beverly Hills on NBC on Sunday Jan. 7, starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT (0100 GMT on Monday).

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of stock indexes around the world hit fresh record highs on Thursday, bolstered by upbeat data from the world\u2019s largest economies, while the euro kept near a three-year high and the U.S. dollar fell versus major currencies.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS broke a record high and was last up 0.79 percent.  The ADP National Employment Report on Thursday showed U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, the biggest monthly increase since March.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 152.45 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 25,075.13, sailing past the 25,000-mark for the first time on Thursday.  The S&P 500 .SPX gained 10.93 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,723.99 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 12.38 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,077.92, with both indexes notching record closing highs.  Separately, China\u2019s services sector activity hit its highest in more than three years and manufacturing data from Japan came in strong. Services PMI data also showed the euro area was close to its strongest growth in seven years, confirming a strengthening economy was boosting corporate activity.  The euro zone's STOXX 50 .STOXX50E had its best day since April 2017, closing up 1.68 percent. London's FTSE .FTSE set a record high on Thursday, up 0.32 percent, while Tokyo's Nikkei .N225, Asia's biggest market, had earlier shot to its highest since 1992 and was up 3.26 percent.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed up 0.52 percent, scaling a decade-high peak as a fifth day of gains in China helped emerging market stocks .MSCIEF to a six-and-a-half-year high.  Those gains come after Wednesday\u2019s release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s mid-December meeting that did little to change a view that it will stick to measured increases in U.S. interest rates.  The minutes showed policymakers expect U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul will boost consumer spending but are still uncertain about the wider impact the stimulus would have on factors such as inflation.   The euro resumed a rally that has taken it to near its highest in three years, while the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, failed to hold gains from the previous session after upbeat U.S. data and the Fed minutes.  The euro EUR= rose 0.47 percent to $1.2069, while the dollar index .DXY was down 0.33 percent.  On Friday, investors will be focused on the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show job gains of 190,000 for December.  James Chen, head of FX research at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey, said his firm\u2019s U.S. payrolls growth forecast is between 200,000 and 220,000 given the strong employment data in other economic indicators.  \u201cAny result falling within or above this range is likely to give the U.S. dollar a boost, as it would help confirm the Fed\u2019s optimistic outlook for the economy and the path to higher interest rates in 2018,\u201d Chen said.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.21 percent versus the greenback to 112.74 per dollar JPY=, while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3551, up 0.27 percent.  Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR was last down 2/32 in price to yield 2.4525 percent, from 2.445 percent late on Wednesday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR was last down 1/32 to yield 2.7847 percent, from 2.783 percent.  U.S. Treasury two-year yields earlier hit a more than nine-year peak, boosted by the stronger-than-forecast ADP report on private hiring.   Yields were tempered by concerns that wage growth may fall short of expectations.   Oil rose above $68 a barrel to its highest since May 2015 on Thursday after unrest in Iran sparked concerns about supply risks and with support coming from another fall in U.S. inventories as refining hit a 12-year high.   U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.44 percent to $61.90 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $67.97, up 0.19 percent.

          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - Partnerships between teachers and doctors could help students and school staffers better deal with \u201ctoxic stress,\u201d suggests a former teacher turned doctor.  Pediatricians can help build resilience in both children and teachers to counter the effects of traumatic childhood experiences, poverty and violence, Dr. Kavitha Selvaraj of the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago writes in the journal Pediatrics.  \u201cBefore I was a pediatrician, I was a teacher, and in my clinic I hear personal stories about people\u2019s children and families that remind me of stories I heard from my students,\u201d Selvaraj told Reuters Health.  In the essay, Selvaraj writes about her own experiences as a teacher in a stressed environment. A seventh-grade biology and health teacher in an underserved neighborhood, she wanted to serve as a role model and inspiration. But in her first year as a teacher, she felt extremely underprepared to handle behavioral outbursts - including being punched in the face by a student - and felt like she spent little time teaching.   Selvaraj nearly quit that year, but didn\u2019t. The students began to trust her, and they began visiting her classroom outside class time. One confided that he was often hungry and found it hard to concentrate at school. Another said he had nightmares after witnessing a fatal shooting in his neighborhood. Another said she was sexually abused by her stepbrother. Selvaraj was able to help these kids with food pantry referrals, conferences with parents and school counselors and calls to the Department of Child and Family Services, respectively.  \u201cAlthough I do not recommend getting punched in the face to help children thrive, the chain of events that unraveled,\u201d she writes, \u201cshowed me that as a teacher and a caring adult figure, I was in a unique position to limit the long-term effects of toxic stress.\u201d  These adverse childhood experiences, also known as ACEs, and early exposure to poverty can lead to toxic stress in children and negative health problems later in life. They also contribute to a higher chance of heart attack, stroke, mental health problems and substance abuse.   \u201cI didn\u2019t realize then what I know now - that there are so many different people who can help children with these stressors,\u201d Selvaraj said in a telephone interview. \u201cAs a teacher, I never dreamt of talking to a pediatrician. Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me I didn\u2019t have to do this alone?\u201d  Pediatricians and teachers can team up to ask students, \u201cWhat is happening to you?\u201d rather than focusing on, \u201cWhy are you behaving this way?\u201d, she said. Children with toxic stress have complex educational, behavioral and medical needs that can\u2019t be handled by one industry or one person.  Doctor-school collaborations have been successful for children with development disorders, ADHD, undernutrition, obesity, food allergies and asthma. Toxic stress can be added to that list, Selvaraj said. Addressing teacher stress, too, can help with burnout and teacher turnover.   She suggests giving teachers a professional support network, strategies to de-escalate charged situations and ways to manage behavior in children with high ACE scores.   \u201cWe have worked closely with the American Academy of Pediatrics Association and leadership to create best practices on bully and peer victimization assessment,\u201d said Dorothy Espelage, a psychology professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   Several resources on the American Academy of Pediatrics website, AAP.org, give parents, teachers and doctors information about bullying, violence and toxic stress in students.  \u201cWe encourage pediatricians to ask about peer relations and stresses at school during wellness checkups,\u201d Espelage told Reuters Health by email.  Selvaraj suggests promoting \u201cthe 7 C\u2019s\u201d of resilience: competence, confidence, connection, character, contribution, coping and control. This includes teaching emotional self-regulation strategies such as meditation and mindfulness in both the classroom and clinic, she said. Doctors and teachers can also talk regularly about at-risk children and their progress.   In a current study at four hospitals in Chicago, Selvaraj and fellow pediatricians are screening students for signs of toxic stress and unmet social needs such as food, housing, childcare, legal services and monthly bills.  \u201cDoctors often get nervous about asking these questions, and we need a massive effort to get everyone on the same page,\u201d she said. \u201cPartnerships won\u2019t have power without parents, pediatricians and teachers involved. It\u2019s a triad of support for our children.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2CoXfQP Pediatrics, online January 1, 2018."

          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) said on Thursday it was shuttering 103 unprofitable Kmart and Sears stores as it continues to streamline operations amid mounting debt and a string of quarterly losses.  The department store operator, which has racked up 24 straight quarters of sales declines, said 64 Kmart stores and 39 Sears stores would be closed between early March and early April this year.  Sears Holdings, once the largest retailer in the United States, said at the end of October that it operated 1,104 stores, nearly half the 2,019 stores it ran in 2012.  The closures announced on Thursday were in addition to 63 stores Sears is closing this month, having also shuttered 330 stores in 2017.  Shares in Sears closed down 4.8 percent on Thursday.  Liquidation sales will begin as early as Jan. 12 at the closing stores, Sears said, adding that \u201celigible\u201d staff at these stores would receive severance.   Company spokesman Chris Brathwaite declined to disclose the number of jobs that would be cut, but said an overwhelming majority of them were part-time positions. He added that only full-time employees typically received severance packages, but that this would vary depending on local laws.  Sears\u2019 billionaire chief executive and biggest shareholder Eddie Lampert said in July that some vendors had reduced their support, placing additional pressure on operations. In October, Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N), one of Sears\u2019 biggest vendors, said it would stop supplying some big name-brand appliances to the department store chain.  Lampert is also among Sears\u2019 biggest lenders through his hedge fund, ESL Investments.  Reporting by Richa Naidu; Editing by Tom Brown and David Gregorio"

          "body": "* Private employers add jobs in Dec -ADP  * Macy\u2019s falls after disappointing holiday sales  * Indexes up: Dow 0.6 pct, S&P 0.4 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct (Updates to late afternoon)  By Caroline Valetkevitch  NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Dow industrials broke above the 25,000 level for the first time on Thursday and other major indexes hit closing record highs again, propelled by strong global economic data that extended the new year\u2019s rally for the stock market.  The 30-member blue-chip index crossed five 1,000-point marks in 2017 on the back of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda and solid corporate earnings.  It took less than a year for the Dow to add a 5,000-point milestone, which is the fastest since the index was created in May 1896.  Wall Street has started 2018 on a strong note. The benchmark S&P index closed above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settled above 7,000 a day earlier. Both indexes also registered closing record highs on Thursday.  Strong manufacturing and services sector data from the world\u2019s largest economies provided a bullish tone on Thursday, while other data showed U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December. Friday will bring the key U.S. non-farm payrolls report.  \u201cThere are expectations we will see volatility creep back into the market and pull this market down,\u201d at some point this year, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  \u201cBut as long as you have economic growth and earnings moving higher... there\u2019s still a solid underpinning,\u201d she said. The rally shows \u201cinvestors are expecting conditions to remain solid at least in the initial couple of months.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 152.45 points, or 0.61 percent, to 25,075.13, the S&P 500 gained 10.93 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,723.99 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.38 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,077.92.  The Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX and a popular options-based gauge of expected near-term price volatility, closed at 9.22. The index has been flirting with record lows in recent months.  Financials led gains on the S&P 500 on Thursday, with Wells Fargo up 1.3 percent, JPMorgan Chase up 1.4 percent and Goldman Sachs also up 1.4 percent.  \u201cThere were very positive notes on the banks today so that set the tone for the group,\u201d said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. \u201cAs we head into earnings, a lot of people will take a break. The banks are well owned. People are positive, but the banks are due for a little pause.\u201d  S&P 500 companies are expected to soon begin reporting quarterly earnings, with JPMorgan results due next week.  On the downside, Victoria\u2019s Secret owner L Brands slid 12.3 percent on a disappointing quarterly earnings forecast.  Macy\u2019s shares fell 3.3 percent after reporting only modest growth in holiday sales and saying it would close stores and slash thousands of jobs this year.  Other department store operators including J.C. Penney Co Inc also tumbled.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.46-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  Volume held up despite a powerful blizzard that caused power outages and travel problems in the U.S. Northeast, and walloped New York City with snow.  About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

          "body": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government is sending three cabinet ministers to the United States to stress the merits of NAFTA, officials said on Thursday, paving the way for key talks that could either sink or save the trade pact.  Canada and Mexico object to major changes that Washington wants to make to the North American Free Trade Agreement, and time is running out to settle differences before the negotiations are scheduled to wrap up at the end of March.  Officials will hold the sixth and penultimate round of talks in Montreal from Jan. 23-28.   Two Canadian cabinet ministers are already in the United States and one more will travel this weekend.  Canada, which sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the United States, has been reaching out to U.S. politicians and the business community for almost two years to bolster support for free trade.  \u201cWe recognize we are heading into an important period. We are certainly preparing for all scenarios, and we\u2019re hopeful that we can make progress,\u201d a spokesman for Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said when asked about the latest visits.  \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on achieving, including in Montreal,\u201d Alex Lawrence, the spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  News releases announcing the ministerial trips make clear the cabinet members have been instructed to \u201cpromote trade and NAFTA.\u201d  Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale wraps up a two-day trip to Kentucky on Friday, the same day that Environment Minister Catherine McKenna finishes a visit to San Francisco. Officials initially indicated McKenna would travel this weekend but later clarified her trip had already started.  Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay is due to visit Tennessee from Friday to Monday.  Canadian officials are increasingly pessimistic about the prospects for the 1994 trade treaty, which U.S. President Donald Trump blames for the loss of hundreds of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs and a big trade deficit with Mexico.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, citing \u201ca level of unpredictability that\u2019s out of our control,\u201d told Global Television late last month that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal for Canadians.\u201d  In a meeting held in Washington last month between the fifth and sixth rounds, negotiators left untouched the thorniest subjects of the sourcing of auto parts, dispute settlement and an expiry clause.  Trade experts predict that unless Canada and Mexico make some concessions in Montreal, Trump will be more tempted to issue a notice of withdrawal from NAFTA.

          "body": "RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Republicans kept control of Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates on Thursday after their candidate won a lottery-style drawing to resolve a tied race, but the losing Democrat said she might challenge the results.  As cameras clicked in a packed room in Richmond, the state elections board chairman pulled a film canister containing Republican incumbent David Yancey\u2019s name from a blue-and-white ceramic bowl loaned by the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.    The win over Democrat Shelly Simonds gives Republicans a slim 51-49 advantage in seats when the legislature\u2019s session starts on Wednesday, letting them determine the House speaker and committee chairmen.  The tie-breaking draw, Virginia\u2019s first since 1971, was unprecedented because of its impact on the House, board Vice Chairwoman Clara Belle Wheeler said.  \u201cThis has never been done before for the longest-running, oldest legislative body, if you will, in the New World,\u201d she said after the drawing.  Simonds told reporters she was weighing her options, raising the prospect of a second recount in a race that has seen several twists since the November vote.  \u201cAt this moment, I am not conceding,\u201d she said.  Yancey initially appeared to have won the contest in southeastern Virginia\u2019s 94th District by 10 votes. Then a recount showed Simonds beating Yancey by one vote. But after a court ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey, the race was left in a tie.  Carl Tobias, an expert in constitutional law at the University of Richmond, said Simonds probably would opt for a fast recount by election officials, although the House could end up deciding the race.  Yancey would not be seated in the case of a recount. But Republicans would still control the House by a 50-49 margin, despite Democrats\u2019 massive gains in Virginia\u2019s statehouse elections in November.   Yancey, prevented by a winter storm from attending the drawing, said in a statement, \u201cThe election is behind us, the outcome is clear, and my responsibility now is to begin the work I was re-elected to do.\u201d  Republicans also control the state Senate. Democrat Ralph Northam is to be sworn in as governor on Jan. 13.  A second House race with a Republican winner remains in dispute. A hearing is set for Friday in a federal lawsuit over the 28th District election, where at least 147 ballots were assigned to the wrong districts.

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Datawatch Corp (DWCH.O), a U.S. data analytics software company, has hired a financial adviser after receiving expressions of interest from potential acquirers, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  The discussions that Datawatch engages in may not lead to any deal, or may result in other outcomes, such as a commercial partnership, the three sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss the confidential matter.  No sale process is underway, the sources added.  Datawatch, which has a market capitalization of around $115 million, did not respond to a request for comment.   Datawatch helps companies prepare and organize data. It competes with larger companies such as Alteryx Inc (AYX.N), which went public last year.  Like many traditional software companies, Datawatch, which was founded in 1985, has been shifting its business model from selling software for large upfront payments to monthly subscription fees. This change can often result in a bumpy financial performance.  Datawatch trades at a revenue multiple of roughly 2.0, below the 3.7 average for the enterprise software and IT services sector, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Datawatch was the target of an activist investor campaign by hedge fund Potrero Capital in 2016. Potrero had urged the company in a presentation in March 2016 to hire a financial adviser to pursue strategic alternatives. The company later reached an agreement with Potrero Capital and added a new director to its board. That director, Charles Gillman, has since left the board.  Datawatch narrowed its net loss to $4 million in fiscal 2017, from a net loss of $14.63 million a year earlier. Annual revenue rose 19 percent to $36.26 million from $30.46 million a year ago.  Its shares rose nearly 70 percent in 2017. Datawatch fell 2.7 percent to close at $9.20 on Thursday.  Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Chang"

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Datawatch Corp (DWCH.O), a U.S. data analytics software company, has hired a financial adviser after receiving expressions of interest from potential acquirers, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  The discussions that Datawatch engages in may not lead to any deal, or may result in other outcomes, such as a commercial partnership, the three sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss the confidential matter.  No sale process is underway, the sources added.  Datawatch, which has a market capitalization of around $115 million, did not respond to a request for comment.   Datawatch helps companies prepare and organize data. It competes with larger companies such as Alteryx Inc (AYX.N), which went public last year.  Like many traditional software companies, Datawatch, which was founded in 1985, has been shifting its business model from selling software for large upfront payments to monthly subscription fees. This change can often result in a bumpy financial performance.  Datawatch trades at a revenue multiple of roughly 2.0, below the 3.7 average for the enterprise software and IT services sector, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Datawatch was the target of an activist investor campaign by hedge fund Potrero Capital in 2016. Potrero had urged the company in a presentation in March 2016 to hire a financial adviser to pursue strategic alternatives. The company later reached an agreement with Potrero Capital and added a new director to its board. That director, Charles Gillman, has since left the board.  Datawatch narrowed its net loss to $4 million in fiscal 2017, from a net loss of $14.63 million a year earlier. Annual revenue rose 19 percent to $36.26 million from $30.46 million a year ago.  Its shares rose nearly 70 percent in 2017. Datawatch fell 2.7 percent to close at $9.20 on Thursday.  Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Chang"

          "title": "Iranian Nobel laureate urges U.S. to back protests with 'political sanctions'",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi urged the United States and international community to support nationwide protests in Iran with political sanctions and not economic measures that could hit the general population.   The protests, which began over economic hardships suffered by the young and working class, pose one of the most sustained challenges to the clerical rulers in almost a decade.  In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Ebadi said she supported the protests \u201cone hundred percent\u201d and urged the people of Iran to stay in the streets in peaceful protests and engage in civil disobedience.  \u201cPeople should stop paying electricity, water and gas bills. They should not pay their tax. They should withdraw their money from banks,\u201d said Ebadi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.  Iran\u2019s army chief declared on Thursday that police had already quelled anti-government unrest that has killed 21 people but that his troops were ready to intervene if needed.  \u201cI call on my dear children in the police forces and the Revolutionary Guards to put down their guns and do not kill their own brothers and sisters. If the country\u2019s situation improves, you would also benefit from it,\u201d said Ebadi, one of the exiled critics of Iran\u2019s leadership.   Reacting to the Revolutionary Guards commander, Mohammad Ali Jafari who said on Wednesday that the protests were over, Ebadi said: \u201cThat\u2019s his opinion. People are still in the streets. Even if they go home, their anger would remain, and the protests would resurface months or years later.\u201d  A senior U.S. official said on Wednesday that the United States aimed to collect \u201cactionable information\u201d that could allow it to pursue sanctions against Iranian individuals and organizations involved in a crackdown on protesters.  The move is part of an effort by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to swiftly side with anti-government protesters who have rattled Iran\u2019s clerical leadership.  Trump tweeted on Wednesday that United States would throw its support behind Iranian protesters at an \u201cappropriate time\u201d.  Ebadi said: \u201cIf Iranian government has the right to talk about human rights abuses in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Syria, other countries, including America, have the right to talk about human rights abuses in Iran.\u201d   She said the economic sanctions and U.S. visa restriction on Iranians \u2014 that both started under Obama \u2014 had only made life more difficult for people, not the government.  \u201cDuring the Obama presidency, I said they should impose political sanctions on Iran, not economic ones. For example, they should ban sales of arms or any tools that can be used to suppress people,\u201d Ebadi said.  She also called for a restriction on Iran\u2019s dozens of radio and television stations, that she said were part of Iran\u2019s \u201cwrongful\u201d foreign policy, and \u201cspread hatred and lies\u201d in different languages.  She asked world powers to provide young Iranians with \u201cfree and fast\u201d satellite internet that cannot be censored by the Iranian authorities.  It was unclear how the protests might affect Trump\u2019s thinking about the 2015 nuclear pact that eased economic pressure on Tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.  Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports under the terms of the international deal.  If he reimposes sanctions on oil, it could increase the economic pain for Iran\u2019s leaders. But analysts said it could also send the wrong message about U.S. support for Iran\u2019s people in the middle of the boldest challenge to the leadership in a decade.

          "body": "(Adds quotes from minister, political context, sources saying minister will stay in Cabinet)  By Teresa Cespedes  LIMA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Peru\u2019s finance minister warned on Thursday that the political crisis that roiled the country in the last days of 2017 was not over yet, but said it should not have any major impact on the economy as long as it is resolved \u201cin a civilized way.\u201d  In a rare press conference, Claudia Cooper maintained the ministry\u2019s previous forecasts for a 4-percent economic expansion and 3.5 percent fiscal deficit this year as President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski\u2019s center-right government continues to focus on increasing infrastructure spending to support a recovery.  Late last month, Kuczynski\u2019s government was shaken by a bid in the opposition-controlled Congress to remove him from office after Odebrecht, a Brazilian company at the center of a massive graft scandal, disclosed it once had business ties with him that he had denied.  Kuczynski narrowly survived with the help of the country\u2019s former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, who called from prison on his loyalists to help defeat the motion and whom Kuczynski pardoned days later.  But Cooper said Peru could face fresh political uncertainty once Congress resumes its activities after a holiday break and local prosecutors question a former Odebrecht executive on the company\u2019s connections with local politicians.  \u201cThe political crisis isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to have is a bump in the road that\u2019s not going to be significant...as long as the crisis is resolved in a civilized way as we\u2019ve done several times before.\u201d  A fresh clash between Kuczynski\u2019s government and Congress could halt the sol currency\u2019s recovery and slow the government\u2019s already-delayed bid to rebuild infrastructure destroyed by severe flooding last year.  Cooper said public investments were suspended for two weeks amid the political turmoil last month, but have since resumed.  Cooper, whose two predecessors were ousted by votes in Congress last year, said it was up to Kuczynski whether she would remain in the Cabinet.  Kuczynski has yet to reveal a new Cabinet since promising to do so \u201cvery soon\u201d a week ago amid a slew of political resignations after the Fujimori pardon.  Two government sources who asked not to be named said Kuczynski was not planning to replace Cooper.  Congress is controlled by a right-wing party led by Fujimori\u2019s children, Keiko and Kenji, who vied for control of his populist political party while he was in prison for graft and human rights crimes.

          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The left-wing frontrunner to win this year\u2019s Mexican presidential election said on Thursday that he would personally take a central role in restoring order after years of violence that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.  Sketching out his plans to end the bloodletting, former Mexico City mayor and presidential contender Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador presented a team of security advisers that drew both on previous governments and the private sector.  He said he wanted to create more opportunities for the rural population in order to disincentivize crime, adding that the military-led approach in place for the past 11 years needed to end.  \u201cYou can\u2019t fight fire with fire,\u201d he said.  If elected president, the 64-year old Lopez Obrador would also become Supreme Commander of Mexico\u2019s armed forces.   Fueled by battles between rival drug gangs, murders in Mexico spiked to a record high last year, dashing President Enrique Pena Nieto\u2019s pledge to get violence under control and hitting his party\u2019s popularity.  Harking back to his experience as mayor from 2000 to 2005, Lopez Obrador said he would hold daily meetings \u201cfrom an early hour\u201d with the heads of the armed forces, the attorney general and interior minister to discuss security.  He did not address the contentious suggestion he has made of exploring an amnesty for criminal gangs, leaving that to aide Alfonso Durazo, who he has tapped as his head of public security.  Durazo suggested any amnesty might apply for farmers growing illicit crops rather than providing a way out for cartel bosses.  \u201cNobody is talking about negotiating with El Mencho, or any of the others,\u201d Durazo said, referring to Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d who allegedly heads a major cartel.  He also said Lopez Obrador would seek to root out corruption.  \u201cWe can\u2019t resolve the problem of lawlessness if we don\u2019t fix the corruption problem first, both in the federal government and particularly in the security forces,\u201d Durazo told reporters.  Durazo is a former aide to ex-President Vicente Fox of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), who broke the longstanding hold on power of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) with his 2000-2006 administration.  Prior to that, Durazo worked closely with the PRI and he split with Fox in 2004, then moved leftward politically.  Fox\u2019s former head of public security, Alejandro Gertz, was also among the team presented by Lopez Obrador, as was Marcos Fastlicht, a businessman and father-in-law of Emilio Azcarraga, chairman of broadcaster Grupo Televisa.  Lopez Obrador repeated pledges to create a \u201cnational guard\u201d and revive the ministry of public security which the PRI scrapped in 2012. He said he would present a detailed security plan before the election.  Reporting by Lizbeth Diaz, Editing by Dave Graham and Rosalba O'Brien"

Iran\u2019s vastness as well as restrictions on independent media make it hard to determine the breadth and depth of the unrest.  The semi-official labor news agency ILNA said the government on Thursday lifted restrictions on Instagram, one of the social media tools used to mobilize protesters. But access to a more widely used messaging app, Telegram, remained blocked, suggesting authorities remained uneasy about protest threats.  In the latest protests, which generally occur after nightfall, social media video showed demonstrators in Khorramabad in southwestern Iran on Wednesday evening throwing stones at riot police, who were retreating.  In other social media footage, hundreds poured into streets of the northwestern city of Orumiyeh near the Turkish border, chanting anti-government slogans.  None of the videos could be authenticated by Reuters.  The student news agency ISNA quoted Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli as saying on Thursday that \u201cat most 42,000 people attended the protests, which is not much\u201d in a nation of 80 million people.  On Wednesday, the commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said the number of \u201ctroublemakers\u201d did not exceed 15,000 nationwide.  Amnesty International said on Thursday that more than a thousand Iranians had been arrested and detained in jails \u201cnotorious for torture and other ill-treatment over the past seven days\u201d, with many being denied access to families and lawyers.  Iranian Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi, in an interview with Reuters, urged the United States and the international community to support protests in Iran with political sanctions and not economic measures that could hit the general population.  She called for a ban on \u201csales of arms or any tools that can be used to suppress people,\u201d and restriction on Iran\u2019s dozens of radio and television stations, that she said were part of a \u201cwrongful\u201d foreign policy, and \u201cspread hatred and lies\u201d in different languages.  A senior U.S. official said on Wednesday that the United States aimed to collect \u201cactionable information\u201d that could allow it to pursue sanctions against Iranian individuals and organizations involved in a crackdown on protesters.  U.S. President Donald Trump - who has criticized Iran for its ballistic missile program and human rights record - said on Wednesday he would throw support behind Iranian protesters at an \u201cappropriate time\u201d.   The United States on Thursday sanctioned five Iranian-based entities it said were owned or controlled by a industrial firm responsible for developing and producing Iran\u2019s solid-propellant ballistic missiles.  Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said earlier this week Washington was seeking emergency sessions on Iran\u2019s turmoil at the U.N. Security Council in New York and the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.  Russia rejected the idea, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov calling it \u201charmful and destructive\u201d, according to RIA news agency.  He said Iran\u2019s domestic affairs had nothing to do with the U.N. Security Council\u2019s role, which was the \u201cmaintenance of international peace and security\u201d.  RARE ANTI-GOVERNMENT OUTBURSTS  As unrest spread across Iran, mainly in smaller cities and towns, protesters said they were tired of official anti-Western rhetoric and it was time for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the government of President Hassan Rouhani to quit.  \u201cI voted for Khatami and Rouhani, hoping for change. Hoping for freedom. Hoping to live like a normal human being. But nothing has changed,\u201d said Maryam Azemi, 48, a mother of two in the city of Karaj near Tehran.  \u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone anymore. We waited so long for change in this country. We tried peaceful ways to bring change, like voting, but look at us now. The officials are competing with each other to rip us off.\u201d  Protests have drawn largely young people and workers but have begun to draw in members of the educated middle class that formed the backbone of a pro-reform revolt almost a decade ago.  After six days of demonstrations, Jafari said on Wednesday that Revolutionary Guards units had been deployed to put down protests in three provinces that have been hotbeds of unrest. That was the clearest sign yet that authorities were taking the protests seriously.  The Revolutionary Guards, the sword and shield of Iran\u2019s Shi\u2019ite theocracy, were instrumental in suppressing an uprising over alleged election fraud in 2009 in which dozens were killed.   STATE-SPONSORED COUNTER-DEMONSTRATIONS  State television broadcast live pictures of pro-government rallies on Thursday, including Ghaemshahr in northern Iran and Mashhad in the northeast, and Shahin Shahr in central Iran. Marchers carried posters saying, \u201cNo to riots\u201d, and \u201cDeath to seditionists\u201d, as well as portraits of Khamenei.  State media said three Iranian security agents were killed on Wednesday near the Iraqi border in a clash that led to the dismantling of a team of \u201ccounter-revolutionaries\u201d who had planned to cause explosions and provoke unrest.   The intelligence ministry said several \u201cterrorists\u201d were killed in the clash and one was arrested. Kurdish rebels are known to be active in the area.  Few believe the protests pose an existential threat to the clerical elite, backed by pervasive security services, that have dominated Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew a U.S.-backed monarchy.         But protesters have become increasingly bold in challenging Khamenei, who blamed the most sustained challenge to his 29 years in power for nearly a decade on \u201cseditionists\u201d and foreign agents.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to harm my country but when I see those who run this country are so corrupt, I feel like I am being suffocated. They just talk. They accuse \u2018the enemies\u2019 of everything,\u201d said protester Reza, 43, a father of three in the central city of Isfahan.    \u201cI am not an enemy. I am an Iranian. I love my country. Stop stealing my money, my children\u2019s money,\u201d he told Reuters by telephone.

          "title": "Dollar retreats versus most currencies; euro nears three-year high",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Thursday, failing to hold the previous day\u2019s gains on the back of upbeat U.S. data, as the euro resumed a rally that has taken it near its highest level in three years.   A stronger-than-expected U.S. private-sector jobs report briefly helped the dollar pare losses versus the euro and extend gains against the yen. But those moves were short-lived.  \u201cThe market quickly faded the mini-rally in the dollar as the trend gave way to what we have been seeing for the past several weeks, which is dollar weakness,\u201d said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.  She added that while the ADP number was better than forecast and will probably lead to high expectations for the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday, the market does not seem to be willing to push the dollar higher.  U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, data from ADP Research Institute showed, the biggest monthly increase since March. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a gain of 190,000 jobs.  With ADP out of the way, investors are now focused on Friday\u2019s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show job gains of 190,000 for December.   James Chen, head of FX research at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey said his firm\u2019s U.S. payrolls forecast is between 200,000-220,000 given the strong employment data in other economic indicators.  \u201cAny result falling within or above this range is likely to give the U.S. dollar a boost, as it would help confirm the Fed\u2019s optimistic outlook for the economy and the path to higher interest rates in 2018,\u201d Chen said.  The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six major rivals, had slipped to its lowest since Sept. 20 on Tuesday, as optimism about the euro zone economy drove the euro above $1.20 for the first time in 3-1/2 months. The index was last down 0.3 percent at 91.878.  The dollar had bounced on Wednesday after strong manufacturing and construction data, as well as somewhat hawkish Federal Reserve minutes.  The dollar rose against the yen, however, up 0.2 percent at 112.78 yen on strong risk appetite across markets.   After earlier hitting a low of $1.2005, the euro recovered to trade as high as $1.2089. The euro last changed hands at $1.2068, up 0.5 percent  Bitcoin, meanwhile, pared losses in late trading, down just 0.8 percent at $15,007 on the Bitstamp exchange. It has lost more than a quarter of its value since hitting record highs in mid-December.  Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Lisa Shumaker"

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans will have to wait until 2019 for the planned final season of the award-winning medieval fantasy series, a gap of more than a year since the end of season seven.  Cable channel HBO said on Thursday that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d would return in 2019 for a six-episode final season. It did not specify the month.  The series is HBO\u2019s biggest hit ever with some 30 million viewers in the United States alone and an army of devoted fans worldwide.  The final season of the Emmy Award-winning show is expected to reveal which of the warring families in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros will win the multigenerational struggle for control of the Iron Throne.  Production on the final season started in October, and filming is expected to last until mid-2018. HBO\u2019s head of programming, Casey Bloys, has said multiple endings will be filmed to avoid leaks or hacks of how the saga ends.  Show creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss told Entertainment Weekly in 2016 that they wanted to make the series finale as spectacular as possible. HBO said on Thursday that Benioff and Weiss will also direct the final season.  The seventh season ended last August with an average of more than 30 million U.S. viewers per episode across multiple platforms. Some of its seven episodes were more than an hour long.  The long gap until the final season would give author George R.R. Martin the chance to finish one or two new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d books that he said in July he was working on. The television series has already advanced beyond the events of Martin\u2019s five published \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d series of novels.

          "body": "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The U.S. tax legislation approved last year is likely to boost growth and investment and is already pushing up equity prices, but should not force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates any faster than expected, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Thursday.  \u201cA lot of good things were done in this tax bill,\u201d said Bullard, who endorsed the alignment of U.S. corporate taxes closer to developed world norms and said he felt that raising the standard deduction would weaken the constituencies behind itemized tax breaks that can distort economic decisions. \u201cI do hold out the possibility that the tax bill will unleash a lot of investment in the U.S. and you will then get an outsized effect.\u201d  Bullard said his \u201cbase case\u201d was for only a modest increase in capital spending, and a possible shift in the economy\u2019s long-term potential growth by a few tenths of a percentage point \u2014 not a dramatic change for the near term but important over the long run.   The recent surge in stock market prices, he said, was a logical \u201crevaluation\u201d of the corporate sector in light of the lower corporate tax rate, not a sign that investors have become irrationally confident or that a risky financial bubble is developing.  For now, he said, the Fed has no reason to think the tax legislation will lead to excessive inflation or other problems that would require a faster pace of rate increases. Indeed he said he is sticking with his current view that rates should be held steady until it is clear the economy has shifted to a faster underlying pace of growth, productivity has increased, or inflation and global interest rates move higher.  The bigger concern, he said, is if the Fed continues raising its short term target interest rate and long term yields remain low, raising the possibility that the overall yield curve becomes downward sloping with short term rates higher than long term ones. That sort of \u201cinversion,\u201d a sign that investors do not trust the long-term outlook and will not place long-term bets, has been a harbinger of recession that the Fed should not risk.  \u201cThe time to have that debate is now, in the first part of 2018,\u201d Bullard said.

          "title": "Use of non-cigarette tobacco products tied to teen smoking",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - Teens who try e-cigarettes, hookah pipes and other non-cigarette tobacco products are more likely to take up cigarette smoking than their peers who never sample these products, a U.S. study suggests.   Researchers followed 10,000 nonsmokers ranging in age from 12 to 17 years old for one year to see how their use of other tobacco products influenced the odds that they would become smokers.   By the end of that year, 469 youth, or about 5 percent, had tried a cigarette and 219, or roughly 2 percent, had smoked within the past month, the study found.   Among the small proportion of teens who had tried e-cigarettes at the start of the study, however, 19 percent had become smokers a year later, as had about 18 percent of hookah users.  \u201cEach type of non-cigarette tobacco product we studied - whether e-cigarettes, cigars, or smokeless tobacco - independently contributed to smoking risk,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Benjamin Chaffee of the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry.  \u201cThese products have different properties, but in terms of predicting future smoking among kids, the risk seems to be the same,\u201d Chaffee said by email.   Vaping - a term for using e-cigarettes and similar devices - was the most popular alternative to traditional cigarettes. About 4 percent of teens had vaped at the start of the study, followed by 3 percent who had smoked a hookah, or water pipe, researchers report in JAMA Pediatrics.   Big tobacco companies, including Altria Group Inc, Lorillard Tobacco Co and Reynolds American Inc, are all developing e-cigarettes. The battery-powered devices feature a glowing tip and a heating element that turns liquid nicotine and other flavorings into a cloud of vapor that users inhale.  More than 2 million middle- and high-school students tried e-cigarettes in 2016, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year, making this the most popular form of tobacco use among young people.   A steady rise in the proportion of adolescents using e-cigarettes in recent years has sparked alarm among tobacco control advocates who fear e-cigarettes will create a new generation of nicotine addicts who may eventually switch to conventional cigarettes.  The current study offers fresh cause for concern, said Adam Leventhal, director of Health, Emotion & Addiction Laboratory at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.   \u201cThe elevated risk of cigarette use uptake in young populations who use e-cigarettes is strong and consistent, and this risk is amplified by the presence or amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes,\u201d Leventhal, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.   \u201cThis study adds to the pile of evidence implicating e-cigarette use in cigarette smoking uptake and also adds new evidence that use of other products also is associated with cigarette smoking uptake,\u201d Leventhal said.   Among youth in the study who had tried more than one product at the start, 74 percent has used e-cigarettes and 65 percent had used a hookah.  Despite the large size of the study population, one limitation is the relatively small number of tobacco product users by year end, particularly the 2 percent of youth who admitted sampling one or more of these items in the past month. This may have weakened some connections between cigarette smoking and other tobacco products, the authors note.   Still, parents should warn children about the dangers of all types of tobacco products, and be careful not to present e-cigarettes as a safe option, said Thomas Wills, a researcher at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center in Honolulu who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   \u201cThey can communicate to their children that they disapprove of all tobacco products because all of them carry significant risk for getting addicted and perhaps suffering adverse health consequences,\u201d Wills said by email.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose on Thursday to its highest since May 2015, on concern about supply risks due to unrest in Iran and another decline in U.S. inventories as refining activity hit a 12-year high.  U.S. oil stocks fell more than expected, continuing a steady drawdown of supplies in the world\u2019s largest oil consumer, though stocks of distillates and gasoline rose on heavy refining activity driven in part by year-end adjustments.   However, cold weather across much of the country was expected to keep demand high, as heating oil prices were just off highs not seen since early 2015.  Brent crude LCOc1, the international benchmark, settled up 23 cents at $68.07 a barrel after hitting a high of $68.27 earlier in the session. U.S. crude CLc1 settled up 38 cents at $62.01, after earlier hitting $62.21, its highest since May 2015.  Freezing weather in the United States has boosted demand for heating oil. Heating oil futures were down 0.7 percent to $2.0741 a gallon; the contract hit highs not seen since February 2014 earlier in the week.  U.S. crude stocks USOILC=ECI fell by 7.4 million barrels in the last week of 2017, exceeding expectations, as refiners boosted activity to their highest rate since 2005, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Thursday.  \u201cThe draw was fairly in line with what we\u2019ve seen in the latter half of 2017,\u201d said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky. U.S. crude stocks have dropped more than 78 million barrels since the middle of 2017 to 424.5 million, the lowest since September 2015.  Anti-government protests since last week in Iran, OPEC\u2019s third-largest producer, have added a geopolitical risk premium to oil prices, though the country\u2019s production and exports have not been affected, sources said.   \u201cThe protests don\u2019t put crude oil production at risk; from that perspective it is sort of a moot geopolitical factor,\u201d said Sarp Ozkan, analyst at Drillinginfo.com in Denver.   Apart from a spike in May 2015, oil is at its highest since December 2014 - the month after a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stop cutting output to support prices.  OPEC, supported by Russia and other non-members, began to reduce output a year ago to remove a glut built up in the previous two years. Compliance has been high, as producers have decided to extend the supply pact until the end of 2018.  OPEC\u2019s cuts are helping reduce global inventories, even as production continues to rise in the United States. U.S. production rose to 9.78 million barrels in the last week.

          "body": "(Adds economist devaluation comment in paragraphs 4 and 5)  LUANDA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - It was Angola\u2019s depleting foreign reserves that prompted the central bank to pursue a more flexible exchange rate strategy, the regulator said on Thursday.  The comment came a day after plans were unveiled to restructure foreign debt and allow looser trading of the kwanza.  The central bank said on Wednesday it would shift from a currency peg to a trading band, which would keep the kwanza\u2019s value against the U.S. dollar within an as-yet defined range.  The changes will be implemented from this month.  Kaan Nazli, senior economist at investment management firm Neuberger Berman, estimated the new currency plan could result in the kwanza effectively devaluing by 30 percent.  \u201cOf course they won\u2019t call it like a devaluation ... but ultimately it is not too far off what the (International Monetary Fund) has identified as the overvaluation of the exchange rate,\u201d Nazli told Reuters.  Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s third largest economy also plans to renegotiate its external debt, which stands at $38 billion, Finance Minister Archer Mangueira said on Wednesday.  Angola\u2019s dollar-denominated bond, which has $1.5 billion outstanding and matures in November 2025, fell 0.2 cents in price to 115.80 cents.  Most of Angola\u2019s external debt is held by multinational lenders like the IMF or by foreign governments, including China, which has huge oil-for-infrastructure deals with the southern African nation.  Angola does not have a developed debt or stock market so a more flexible exchange rate is less significant for investors than in more developed markets. Lenders like the IMF have been calling for looser currency controls, however.  \u201cMultilateral lenders will look favourably on the developments, so they might be more willing to restructure some of the debt,\u201d said Cobus de Hart, analyst at NKC African Economics.  The central bank said in a statement on Thursday its decision to ease currency controls came after it had analysed the \u201cmacroeconomic fundamentals of the Angolan economy, and particularly the decreasing trend of international reserves\u201d.  The regulator has been trying to defend the currency using foreign exchange reserves, but reserves have more than halved since 2013 to about $14 billion.  Oil accounts for around 90 percent of Angola\u2019s government revenue and years of depressed crude prices have hammered once booming economic growth and eroded foreign currency reserves.  Angola, Africa\u2019s second biggest oil exporter, has maintained a quasi-pegged exchange rate of about 166 kwanza per dollar, even though the dollar buys about 400 kwanza on a thriving black market.  Under the new system, forex trading will be carried out at trading auctions where a weighted average of offers from the central bank and commercial banks will set the exchange rate.  \u201cIn other words, the exchange rate is now determined by the transactions that take place in the primary market by auction,\u201d the central bank said.

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday his goal for 2018 was to put the business he co-founded on a more solid footing, a break with his longstanding practice of setting a purely personal annual goal.  \u201cThe world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do,\u201d Zuckerberg, at 33 one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people, wrote in a post on the No. 1 social media network.

          "title": "Tesla Model 3 delay raises cashflow risks, but analysts upbeat",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares recouped some of their losses on Thursday after falling as much as 3.6 percent, a day after it pushed back a production target for its much-anticipated Model 3 sedan yet again.  Analysts stayed upbeat, saying the electric car maker had finally set an achievable target for their mass-market sedan that is priced at $35,000. The delay, however, is likely to impact Tesla\u2019s cashflow, a big challenge for many quarters now.  Tesla said on Wednesday it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. The company now expects to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.  \u201cWith absolute Model 3 sales tracking behind expectations and Model 3 gross margin improvement likely to be pushed out until production reaches greater scale, the expected cash tailwind from Model 3 will take longer to manifest itself than was anticipated,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst George Galliers said in a note.  Tesla, headed by Elon Musk, has been struggling to overcome production bottlenecks and reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss in the July-September quarter.  The company burned through $1.1 billion in cash in that quarter and said in November it would spend roughly the same amount in the fourth quarter. It had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30.  Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja had reassured investors that cash flow would \u201cimprove significantly\u201d over the next few quarters as Tesla continued to ramp up Model 3 production.  Tesla shares were down at $313.02 in afternoon trading. The median price target on the stock is $310 and eight of 25 brokerages covering the stock rate it \u201cbuy\u201d or higher. Eight have a \u201chold\u201d rating and the rest a \u201csell\u201d or lower.  \u201cWe believe that Tesla may have finally set a beatable production target,\u201d Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a note.  \u201cImportantly, we believe that Tesla is prioritizing quality control. While Tesla\u2019s repeated guidance revisions could begin to risk damaging its elite brand, a mass-recall would probably be far more damaging,\u201d he said.  Tesla\u2019s luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory and quality checks have routinely revealed defects in nearly all of these models inspected after assembly, Reuters reported in November, citing sources.  Tesla has maintained that its quality control process is unusually rigorous.      Analysts said on Thursday they continue to believe that sales of the Model 3 sedan could transform the niche automaker into a mass producer, giving it an edge over a host of rivals such as General Motors Co (GM.N) and BMW (BMWG.DE) who are entering the nascent electric car market.  \u201cGiven that TSLA received over 400k Model 3 reservations with essentially no marketing, we believe potential demand for the vehicle is likely underestimated, and think TSLA could significantly increase demand through its own advertising in the future,\u201d Baird Equity Research analyst Ben Kallo said.

          "body": "* Private employers add jobs in Dec -ADP  * Macy\u2019s falls after disappointing holiday sales  * Indexes up: Dow 0.6 pct, S&P 0.4 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct (Updates to late afternoon)  By Caroline Valetkevitch  NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial average rose above the 25,000 level for the first time on Thursday and other major indexes scaled new records, propelled by strong economic data both in the United States and abroad.  The 30-member blue-chip index crossed five 1,000-point marks in 2017 on the back of President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda and solid corporate earnings.  It took less than a year for the Dow to add a 5,000-point milestone, which is the fastest since the index was created in May 1896.  Wall Street has started 2018 on a strong note. The benchmark S&P index closed above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settled above 7,000 a day earlier.  \u201cWe saw Apple doing well, and we\u2019re also seeing energy, which was a laggard last year, do well. The integrated names are gaining interest as oil prices are moving higher,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  Also, strong manufacturing and services sector data from the world\u2019s largest economies provided a bullish tone on Thursday, while other data showed U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December. Friday will bring the key U.S. non-farm payrolls report.  \u201cAs long as you have economic growth and earnings moving higher, there\u2019s still a solid underpinning,\u201d Krosby said.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 154.35 points, or 0.62 percent, to 25,077.03, the S&P 500 gained 11.73 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,724.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.83 points, or 0.17 percent, to 7,077.37.  The S&P energy index was up 0.5 percent on the day and 3.8 percent for the week so far. Financials led gains on the S&P 500 on Thursday, though, with Wells Fargo and JPMorgan up about 1.5 percent and Goldman Sachs up 1.3 percent.  Apple was up 0.5 percent.  On the downside, Victoria\u2019s Secret-owner L Brands slid 11.3 percent on disappointing quarterly earnings forecast.  Macy\u2019s shares fell 3.2 percent after reporting only modest growth in holiday sales and saying it would close stores and slash thousands of jobs this year.  Other department store operators including J.C. Penney Co Inc also tumbled.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.76-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

          "body": "(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday declared unconstitutional Idaho\u2019s bans on shooting secret videos and lying to enter factory farms to expose animal abuse, but revived other parts of the state\u2019s law to curb undercover probes into the practice.  The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle reversed part of a lower court ruling that Idaho\u2019s 2014 \u201cag-gag\u201d law was unconstitutional on free speech grounds.  Writing for a 2-1 majority, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown called the video ban a \u201cclassic example of a content-based restriction that cannot survive strict scrutiny.\u201d  She also said the ban on making misrepresentations to enter facilities was void because it could criminalize innocent behavior, suffered from \u201cstaggering\u201d overbreadth, and was largely \u201ctargeted at speech and investigative journalists.\u201d  But the appeals court said Idaho could criminalize making misrepresentations to obtain records of agricultural facilities, and to obtain employment there with the intent of causing economic harm.  Idaho\u2019s Republican governor, C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter, signed the ag-gag law in February 2014.  The law was passed after activists had released a video showing workers at a dairy beating and abusing cows, including when a tractor was used to drag a cow chained at the neck.  Justin Marceau, a lawyer representing the Animal Legal Defense Fund in the case, called the appeals court decision a \u201cmixed bag\u201d for animal rights advocates.  \u201cIt is a landmark decision because it upholds the right to record on factory farms and other private property,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cUntil today no federal circuit court had recognized (that right) outside the public sphere.\u201d  Marceau also said the ALDF will review its options on the parts of the law that were revived.  The office of Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, which defended the law, is reviewing the decision, spokesman Scott Graf said.  Agricultural groups have pressed U.S. states to enact ag-gag laws to stop activists and journalists from secretly probing animal abuse at farms, dairies, feedlots and slaughterhouses.  Eleven states had such laws as of October 2017, though four faced legal challenges, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  In Thursday\u2019s decision, McKeown also rejected the argument that Idaho\u2019s ban on obtaining employment through misrepresentations was too broad because it could cover people who merely inflate their credentials, saying they lacked the needed intent to injure.

The bond was sold at a price of 99.654 percent and carries an annual coupon interest rate of one percent.  \u201cOrders from 155 investors reached 3.2 billion euros without including the interest of the lead organisers of the issue,\u201d the ministry said.  Lead managers of the issue were Citi, Commerzbank, Goldman Sachs International Bank, HSBC, Jefferies and Slovenian Nova Ljubljanska Banka.  The ministry said fund managers purchased 57 percent of the issue, followed by 18 percent that went to central banks and other official institutions, while banks purchased 13 percent of the issue. Insurers and pension funds bought 12 percent of the bond.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Thursday, failing to hold the previous day\u2019s gains on the back of upbeat U.S. data, as the euro resumed a rally that has taken it near its highest level in three years.   A stronger-than-expected U.S. private-sector jobs report briefly helped the dollar pare losses versus the euro and extend gains against the yen. But those moves were short-lived.  \u201cThe market quickly faded the mini-rally in the dollar as the trend gave way to what we have been seeing for the past several weeks, which is dollar weakness,\u201d said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.  She added that while the ADP number was better than forecast and will probably lead to high expectations for the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday, the market does not seem to be willing to push the dollar higher.  U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, data from ADP Research Institute showed, the biggest monthly increase since March. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a gain of 190,000 jobs.  With ADP out of the way, investors are now focused on Friday\u2019s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show job gains of 190,000 for December.   James Chen, head of FX research at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey said his firm\u2019s U.S. payrolls forecast is between 200,000-220,000 given the strong employment data in other economic indicators.  \u201cAny result falling within or above this range is likely to give the U.S. dollar a boost, as it would help confirm the Fed\u2019s optimistic outlook for the economy and the path to higher interest rates in 2018,\u201d Chen said.  The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six major rivals, had slipped to its lowest since Sept. 20 on Tuesday, as optimism about the euro zone economy drove the euro above $1.20 for the first time in 3-1/2 months. The index was last down 0.3 percent at 91.878.  The dollar had bounced on Wednesday after strong manufacturing and construction data, as well as somewhat hawkish Federal Reserve minutes.  The dollar rose against the yen, however, up 0.2 percent at 112.78 yen on strong risk appetite across markets.   After earlier hitting a low of $1.2005, the euro recovered to trade as high as $1.2089. The euro last changed hands at $1.2068, up 0.5 percent  Bitcoin, meanwhile, pared losses in late trading, down just 0.8 percent at $15,007 on the Bitstamp exchange. It has lost more than a quarter of its value since hitting record highs in mid-December.  Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Lisa Shumaker"

          "title": "Fewer black, Hispanic patients get kidney transplants from live donors",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - Black and Hispanic patients who need kidney transplants are less likely than white people to receive organs from live donors and this disparity has worsened over time, a U.S. study suggests.   After two years of waiting for a kidney, 11.4 percent of white patients received an organ from a live donor in 2014, almost four times the proportion of black patients, researchers report in JAMA. Two decades earlier, 7 percent of white patients got kidneys from live donors, which was roughly twice the proportion among black people.   Over the 20-year study period, the proportion of black patients getting live kidneys fell from 3.4 percent to 2.9 percent.   During the same period, the proportion of Hispanic patients getting kidneys from live donors also declined, from 6.8 percent to 5.9 percent. Among Asian kidney recipients, however, live donation became more common, rising from 5.1 percent to 5.6 percent of patients.   \u201cWe know that live-donor kidney transplants that involve patients receiving a kidney from a living relative, friend or other altruistic person are associated with longer life expectancy and higher quality of life as compared with deceased donor kidney transplants or long-term dialysis treatment,\u201d said lead study author Tanjala Purnell, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.   While U.S. patients from racial and ethnic minority groups have long been less likely than white people to receive kidneys from live donors, the widening gap found in the study was a shock, Purnell said by email.   While the study didn\u2019t examine why this disparity persists, it\u2019s possible some of the problem may be explained by racial and ethnic minorities having less access to private health insurance, primary care providers and kidney specialists as well as language barriers or cultural or religious concerns about donation, Purnell said.   \u201cIt is important for patients to have early conversations about the benefits and risks of live-donor kidney transplantation with their doctors and family members,\u201d Purnell added. \u201cThese conversations may be important for alleviating concerns about transplantation and donation.\u201d  Shifts in organ donation policies and patient outreach in recent years have helped to increase the proportion of minority patients receiving kidneys from deceased donors, but haven\u2019t had the same impact on live donation.   For the study, researchers examined data on 453,162 adults awaiting kidney transplants from 1995 to 2014.   Patients were typically around 51 years old and most were male. Almost half of them were white, although 30 percent were black, 16 percent were Hispanic and 6 percent were Asian.  Overall, 39,509 patients received live-donor kidney transplants within two years of joining the wait list, the study found.   Compared to white patients, black patients were 73 percent less likely to receive live kidney donations by the end of the study, while Hispanic patients had 48 percent lower odds and Asian patients had 58 percent lower odds.   At the beginning of the study period, black patients had been 55 percent less likely than white patients to receive a live-donor organ, Hispanic patients had been 17 percent less likely and Asian patients 46 percent less likely.   The study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how race and ethnicity might influence the chances of receiving a kidney transplant from a live donor, or why disparities have increased over time. Researchers also couldn\u2019t account for factors like income that might influence these odds.   At least some of the disparities revealed in the study may represent differences in how easily donors can afford to help, said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, co-author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at the University of Texas Health San Antonio. Patients with higher income, paid time off from work and more comprehensive medical benefits might have an easier time being live donors.   \u201cLiving donation rates among Black and Hispanic patients seem to be limited by clustering of medical risk factors such as obesity and diabetes which are linked to kidney disease, reduced access and education regarding transplant options among Black and Hispanic patients, and financial disincentives faced by donors related to lost wages and fear of losing employment secondary to time needed for recovery,\u201d Cigarroa said by email.   \u201cAdditionally, as we set forth in our editorial, evidence has been provided that these factors are related to the socioeconomic status of the patient and donor as much or more than they are genetic differences related to race and ethnicity,\u201d Cigarroa added.

          "title": "Trump administration aims to open nearly all U.S. offshore to oil drilling",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, a move aimed at boosting domestic energy production that sparked protests from coastal states, environmentalists and the tourism industry.  The effort to open previously off-limits acreage in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans comes less than eight years after BP Plc\u2019s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico - the largest in American history. The disaster caused billions of dollars in economic damage and led former President Barack Obama\u2019s to increase regulation of the industry.  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Thursday the department\u2019s draft National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2019 to 2024 would make over 90 percent of the outer continental shelf\u2019s total acreage available for leasing to drillers, a national record.   That would reverse the Obama administration order placing 94 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers. Obama\u2019s 2017-2022 plan would be replaced by the new program when it is finalized.  \u201cWe want to grow our nation\u2019s offshore energy industry, instead of slowly surrendering it to foreign shores,\u201d Zinke said in prepared remarks.   He said 25 of 26 planning areas on the Outer Continental Shelf will be considered for leasing, covering all U.S. coastlines. Proposed sales include 19 off the coast of Alaska, seven in the Pacific, 12 in the Gulf of Mexico and nine in the Atlantic Region. The last offshore lease sales for the East and West coasts were in the 1980s.  Alaska\u2019s North Aleutian Basin/Bristol Bay will be exempted after drilling was barred there by a previous executive order.  Zinke said the proposal was just the start of a dialogue with local stakeholders and the plan was not final. The draft will be subject to a 60-day comment period.  The proposal marks a huge shift from previous policy.  Weeks before leaving office, Obama banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, protecting 115 million acres (46.5 million hectares) of waters off Alaska and 3.8 million acres (1.5 million hectares)in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay.   Trump in April ordered the Interior Department to overhaul the leasing schedule to promote increased drilling. At the time, low oil prices and soaring onshore production were curtailing demand for offshore leases, raising questions about the benefits of the move. Oil prices have since risen to around three-year highs.  Industry groups welcomed Thursday\u2019s announcement.   \u201cExpanding access to additional offshore reserves allows the United States to better understand where production potential exists and where capital should be invested,\u201d said Independent Petroleum Association of America senior vice president Dan Naatz.    But lawmakers from both parties, environmental groups,  governors and local business leaders said they were opposed to any effort to open coastlines to drilling rigs, citing environmental risks and threats to lucrative tourism industries.  Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott said he is aggressively fighting to plan. \u201cI have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,\u201d he said.  Environmental groups described the plan as dangerous.  \u201cTrump\u2019s trying to turn our oceans into oilfields. His reckless plan would expose more wildlife and coastal communities to devastating oil spills,\u201d said Kristen Monsell, ocean program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity.       Coastal tourism business groups were girding for a long fight against the proposal, which comes as the Gulf Coast recovers from the Deepwater spill. The plan would open the California coast where drilling opposition has been fierce since a major oil spill in the 1960s soiled popular beaches.  Frank Knapp, founder of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, accused the federal agency of favoring the oil and gas sector over the tourism sector.  \u201cWhat part of the business sector are they listening to? It\u2019s certainly not small or coastal businesses,\u201d Knapp said.  The Defense Department has also raised concerns about opening drilling that had been banned off the eastern Gulf of Mexico, where military exercises are held.

          "body": "(Adds comments, background)  By Phil Stewart  WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Thursday played down a delay of U.S.-South Korean military exercises, saying they would resume after the conclusion of the March 9-18 Paralympics and that their postponement was simply due to logistical concerns.  Mattis also credited U.S.-championed international pressure on North Korea over its nuclear weapons and missile programs for Pyongyang\u2019s offer of talks with the South but added it was too soon to say whether the North Korean gesture was meaningful.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read too much into it because we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a genuine olive branch,\u201d Mattis said during an impromptu, off-camera press briefing at the Pentagon.  Mattis praised the United Nations for the pressure it has put on Pyongyang, pointing to the three latest rounds of sanctions that have sought to squeeze the North\u2019s economy as punishment for its weapons programs.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is racing to develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reliably striking the United States.  \u201cIt is difficult for me to disassociate that he\u2019s now wanting to negotiate on any issue (after) months and months of unanimous United Nations Security Council effort,\u201d Mattis said, referring to Kim.  Trump on Thursday called potential talks between North and South Korea \u201ca good thing\u201d and took credit for any dialogue.  The South Korean and U.S. militaries usually hold military exercises called Key Resolve and Foal Eagle every spring, which can involve as many as 17,000 U.S. troops and more than 300,000 South Koreans.  North Korea denounces the drills as preparations to invade it, and it has at times conducted missile tests or taken other aggressive action in response.  Discussions on whether to postpone the drills have been going on for months.  Mattis said the decision to delay the drills until after the Olympics and subsequent Paralympics was due to logistical concerns, since many South Korean security forces would be occupied with the country\u2019s biggest tourist event of the year.  \u201cI would say for us it\u2019s a practical matter,\u201d Mattis said, refusing to link it to any overtures toward dialogue between the Koreas.  On Tuesday, Trump responded to Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day speech, in which Kim warned he had a nuclear button on his desk, by saying that his nuclear button \u201cis a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d  The tweet provoked strong criticism, especially from Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents, and former Vice President Joe Biden called it dangerously cavalier.  Mattis declined to comment on Trump\u2019s remarks, referring reporters to the White House. (Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by James Dalgleish)"

The 30-member blue-chip index was driven partly by President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda and solid corporate earnings.  The Dow\u2019s latest 1,000-point milestone comes 24 trading days after it first closed above the 24,000 mark. Strong U.S. economic data, solid corporate earnings and upbeat sentiment following indications of robust growth globally has helped buoy U.S. investor sentiment.  The latest rush of round number milestones for the big three benchmark U.S. stock indexes \u2013 25,000 for the Dow, 7,000 for the Nasdaq and 2,700 for the S&P 500 \u2013 comes against a backdrop of significant exuberance for stocks.  Wednesday\u2019s weekly AAII Sentiment Survey, which measures the percentage of individual investors who are bullish, bearish, and neutral on the stock market short term, showed bullishness at its highest since November 2014, bearishness at the lowest since November 2015 and the gap between bull and bear camps the widest in three years.  Apple Inc\u2019s inclusion in the Dow on March 18, 2015 gave a significant boost to the index\u2019s performance relative to other benchmark U.S. stock indexes.  In the two years prior to Apple\u2019s inclusion the Dow lagged the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Since Apple\u2019s inclusion the Dow has handily topped the S&P 500 index\u2019s performance and its gains are nearly at par with that of the Nasdaq.  Despite its fiery advance over the last year, the Dow is still the poor cousin when it comes to its relative performance compared with the other benchmark U.S. stock indexes, over the length of the current bull market.

          "body": "* Strong growth data pushes global stocks up  * Euro near three-year high  * Oil hits highest since mid 2015 (Updates to European trading close; adds commentary)  By Stephanie Kelly  NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Global shares shattered records and European stocks closed higher on Thursday, bolstered by upbeat data from the world\u2019s largest economies, while the euro hovered near a three-year high and the U.S. dollar fell against major currencies.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe broke a new record, last gaining 0.83 percent.  The ADP National Employment Report on Thursday showed that U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, marking the biggest monthly increase since March.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 161.5 points, or 0.65 percent, to 25,084.18, sailing past the 25,000-mark for the first time.  \u201cWith the Dow Jones hitting 25,000 for the first time, there seems no end in sight to a stock market rally spurred on by much stronger-than-expected jobs data for December, offering yet further evidence of the strength of the U.S. economy,\u201d said Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform Infinox in London, in a note.  The S&P 500 gained 13.82 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,726.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,079.60, with both indexes hitting fresh highs.  Separately, China\u2019s services sector activity hit its highest level in more than three years and manufacturing data from Japan came in strong. Services PMI data also showed the euro area was close to its best growth in seven years, confirming a strengthening economy was boosting corporate activity.  The euro zone\u2019s STOXX 50 had its best day since April 2017, closing up 1.68 percent. London\u2019s FTSE set a record on Thursday, up 0.32 percent, while Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei - Asia\u2019s biggest market - had earlier shot to its highest since 1992 and was up 3.26 percent.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed up 0.49 percent, scaling a decade-high peak as a fifth day of gains in China helped emerging market stocks to a six-and-a-half year high.  Those gains come after Wednesday\u2019s release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s mid-December meeting that did little to change a view that it will stick to measured increases in U.S. interest rates.  The minutes showed policymakers expect U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul will boost consumer spending but are still uncertain about the wider impact the stimulus would have on factors such as inflation.  The euro resumed a rally that has taken it near its highest levels in three years, while the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, failed to hold its previous session\u2019s gains after upbeat U.S. data and minutes from the Federal Reserve.  The euro rose 0.42 percent to $1.2063, while the dollar index was down 0.26 percent.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.29 percent versus the greenback at 112.83 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3541, up 0.20 percent on the day.  U.S. Treasury yields rose, with two-year yields hitting a more than nine-year peak as upbeat December private hiring data boosted expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates at its March policy meetings.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.4543 percent, from 2.445 percent late on Wednesday.  The 30-year bond last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.7894 percent, from 2.783 percent late on Wednesday.  Oil rose above $68 a barrel to its highest since May 2015 after unrest in Iran sparked concerns about supply risks and with support coming from OPEC-led output cuts and demand-boosting cold weather in the United States.  U.S. crude rose 0.68 percent to $62.05 per barrel and Brent was last at $68.01, up 0.25 percent on the day.

          "title": "UK social housing deal with private equity giant sparks fears for tenants",
          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Private equity giant Blackstone has struck a deal with UK social housing association Sage, sparking fears from campaigners that it will price out low-earning, elderly and sick tenants.  New York-based Blackstone, which owns the largest home rental company in the United States, will fund for-profit housing association Sage to buy affordable homes from private developers, property magazine\u00a0Estates Gazette said.  \u201c(Blackstone and Sage\u2019s) purely profit motive is contrary to the social purpose objectives of most traditional housing associations,\u201d said Tom Murtha, co-founder of SHOUT, which campaigns for more investment in social housing.  \u201cTo make the return they need ... Sage and Blackstone would increase rent beyond the means of those on low-income, in the greatest need,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cIf they acquired social housing, it would soon cease to be social housing,\u201d he said in emailed comments, referring to homes below market rent for people on low incomes.      Blackstone and Sage declined to comment.  Britain is experiencing a housing crisis as homebuilding has not kept pace with demand, driving up property prices, with rents rising faster than wages and homelessness soaring.  Local authorities housing stock has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s, with ownership of social homes shifting to private charities and housing associations.  Rising income inequality has led to poorer residents being squeezed out of central areas as wealthier inhabitants and investors snap up real estate, campaigners say.       Blackstone\u2019s 2013 purchase of hundreds of rent-controlled flats in the Spanish capital, Madrid, from the city council, sparked fears that thousands of tenants could be evicted.  The Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people in public housing in June, has prompted debate about London\u2019s stark social inequalities and whether neglect of social housing estates played a part in the disaster.  \u201cResidents and communities, post-Grenfell, need to take center stage rather than large and unaccountable for-profit landlords supported by foreign investment funds,\u201d said Kevin Gulliver, director of the Human City Institute, a think tank.  \u201cGrenfell underscored the dire consequences of the marginalisation of social housing and its decline from 33 to 17 percent of housing over the last four decades,\u201d he said in emailed comments.  On its website, Sage said that it has provided homes for 100,000 families in England and \u201cpartners with developers and managers from across the residential market, both public and private, to increase the supply of quality affordable housing\u201d.

          "body": "OSLO (Reuters) - Last year was the second hottest worldwide on record, just behind a sweltering 2016, with signs of climate change ranging from wildfires to a thaw of Arctic ice, a European Union monitoring center said on Thursday.  The Copernicus Climate Change Service, the first major international weather agency to report on conditions in 2017, said temperatures averaged 14.7 degrees Celsius (58.46 Fahrenheit) at the Earth\u2019s surface - 1.2C (2.2F) above pre-industrial times.  Last year was slightly \u201ccooler than the warmest year on record, 2016, and warmer than the previous second warmest year, 2015\u201d, it said. Temperature records date back to the late 19th century.  \u201cIt\u2019s striking that 16 of the 17 warmest years have all been this century,\u201d Jean-Noel Thepaut, head of Copernicus, told Reuters, adding there was overwhelming scientific consensus that man-made emissions were stoking the warming trend.  The Copernicus study is in line with a projection by the U.N. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in November that 2017 would be second or third warmest behind 2016.  In 2016, an extra dose of heat came from El Nino, a natural event that releases heat from the Pacific Ocean every few years.  But last year was the hottest year without an El Nino, according to Copernicus, run by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.  It pointed to a retreat of sea ice in the Arctic and prolonged dry conditions in southern Europe that helped trigger wildfires in Portugal and Spain in 2017 as examples of the sort of disruptions that are becoming more frequent in a warming climate.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts that climate change has a human cause, tweeted on Dec. 29 about bone-chilling cold in the United States and cast doubt on the need for action to limit emissions.  \u201cPerhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!\u201d he wrote.  Trump plans to quit the 2015 Paris Agreement, which has the backing of almost 200 nations and seeks to limit the rise in temperatures to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) above pre-industrial times, ideally 1.5 C (2.7 F).  High winds and heavy show barreled into the U.S. northeast on Thursday, closing schools and government offices and disrupting travel. [L1N1OZ0C5]   Data on Thursday compiled by the University of Maine and the Climate Change Institute showed temperatures in the eastern United States, Greenland and parts of central Asia were indeed colder than usual, while most of the rest of the world was warmer.      Earlier on Thursday, German reinsurer Munich Re said insurers would have to pay claims of around $135 billion for 2017, the most ever, following a spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America.  Thepaut said rising sea levels and higher temperatures that can produce more rainfall may have aggravated Atlantic hurricanes, even though it was hard to detect links between individual storms and man-made climate change.  The WMO will publish its review of 2017 temperatures, also drawing on Copernicus and other U.S., British and Japanese data, in about two weeks.

          "title": "UPDATE 4-Trump administration rescinds Obama-era marijuana enforcement policy",
          "body": "* Six states have legalized marijuana for recreational use  * Trump previously said pot legalization \u201cup to the states\u201d (Adds federal funding restrictions on medicinal marijuana, California reaction, Trump\u2019s previous marijuana comments, banking relationships with marijuana businesses)  By Sarah N. Lynch  WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday rescinded an Obama administration policy that had eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states that legalized the drug, instead giving federal prosecutors wide latitude on pursuing criminal charges.  The action by Attorney General Jeff Sessions could have damaging consequences on the burgeoning marijuana industry in the six states including California and Colorado that have legalized the drug for recreational use, plus dozens of others that permit medicinal use.  Justice Department officials who briefed reporters about the policy change declined to say whether the department might take legal action against those states, saying further steps were \u201cstill under consideration.\u201d  Sessions, known as a strong opponent of legalizing marijuana, stopped short of directly encouraging U.S. prosecutors to bring marijuana cases.  His action, outlined in a one-page memo, drew condemnation from marijuana legalization advocates and politicians in both parties who said it trampled on the rights of voters in states where the drug is now legal and created uncertainty about how strictly federal drugs laws will be enforced.  The announcement came three days after California formally launched the world\u2019s largest regulated commercial market for recreational marijuana.  The administration\u2019s move raised questions about how it might impact tax revenues in states that permit some form of legal marijuana use.  It also created uncertainty for banks, which have already been fearful about having a business relationship with the marijuana industry due to concerns they might run afoul of anti-money laundering rules.  The policy put in place under Democratic former President Barack Obama, outlined by then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole in a series of memos, recognized marijuana as a \u201cdangerous drug,\u201d but said the Justice Department expected states and localities that authorized various uses of the drug to effectively regulate and police it.  The Obama-era policy had discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing marijuana-related criminal crimes in states that had legalized the drug. The Trump administration policy gives federal prosecutors around the country discretion to enforce the existing federal ban on marijuana.  There has been a surge in legalization of marijuana in U.S. states in recent years. Other states that permit the regulated sale of marijuana for recreational use also include Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and Nevada. Massachusetts and Maine are on track to do so this year.  California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said his state will pursue \u201call legal, legislative and political options to protect its reforms and its rights as a state.\u201d He said the Trump administration\u2019s position \u201cdefies facts and logic.\u201d  Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado said on Twitter that the administration\u2019s action \u201cdirectly contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation.\u201d  Gardner added that he would take all steps necessary to fight the measure, including possibly holding up the Senate from voting on pending Justice Department nominees.  The administration\u2019s action seemed incongruous with comments that Trump made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump told a TV news reporter that the decision to legalize marijuana should be left \u201cup to the states.\u201d  Among companies that have invested in the industry, Scotts Miracle-Gro, a gardening product manufacturer, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire companies that sell soil, lighting, fertilizer and other products to marijuana growers. Shares in the company dropped 3.8 percent to $104.54 after the news of the policy shift, before paring losses later in the morning. Several Canadian marijuana-related stocks also fell sharply.  Sessions has made no secret about his disdain for marijuana. He has said the drug is harmful and should not be legalized, and has also called it a gateway drug for opioid addicts.  The Sessions memo did not distinguish between enforcement against marijuana used for recreational versus medicinal purposes. But his department\u2019s ability to pursue criminal charges related to medicinal marijuana remains in doubt.  Since 2014, federal lawmakers have attached language to spending legislation that explicitly bars the Justice Department from spending resources to enforce cases in states where medicinal marijuana is legal.  The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 ruled that the Justice Department cannot prosecute people over medicinal marijuana if they complied with their state\u2019s rules and regulations. But the ruling held that people who violate the medicinal marijuana laws in their states can face federal criminal prosecution.  A task force created under a Trump February 2017 executive order, comprised of prosecutors and other law enforcement officials, was supposed to study marijuana enforcement, along with other policy areas, and issue recommendations.  Its recommendations were due in July 2017, but the Justice Department has not made public what the task force determined was appropriate for marijuana. Department officials on Thursday declined to disclose what the task force recommended.  Reporting by Sarah N. Lynch; Additional reporting by Susan\nHeavey; Editing by Will Dunham and Frances Kerry"

          "body": "TORONTO/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Home sales in Canada\u2019s two largest housing markets dropped in 2017, as government measures to cool skyrocketing prices in Toronto and Vancouver restrained demand, but prices kept rising particularly in the strong condo segment.  In Toronto, sales of detached homes fell 23 percent, accounting for much of the 2017 drop, while condo sales pulled back a more muted 9.6 percent, according to a report from the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB).      The average sale price, meanwhile, jumped 12.7 percent from 2016 to C$822,681 ($657,146), with condo prices jumping 23.1 percent and detached homes climbing 12.8 percent, TREB said.  In Vancouver, the market was also split, with surging condo demand in stark contrast to slower sales of detached homes, according to a report from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver (REBGV).   Overall, sales dropped 9.9 percent compared to 2016, with the typical price of a home in the Vancouver region rising 15.9 percent to C$1,050,300. Condo prices jumped 25.9 percent, while detached homes rose 7.9 percent.  In both cities, the pace of sales picked up near the end of 2017, in part as buyers accelerated home purchases to beat new mortgage stress test requirements that started on Jan. 1.  Together, Vancouver and Toronto account for about half of house sales by volume in Canada.  Vancouver\u2019s market staggered in 2016 after the government introduced a foreign buyers tax, but the less-expensive condo market has bounced back as investors continue to fuel demand. Toronto, hit by a similar tax in 2017, is showing a similar pattern, with detached sales swooning but the condo market showing more strength.  The real estate boards said the outlook for 2018 was unclear. They said consumer sentiment could be influenced by rising interest rates and new rules around mortgage qualifications.

          "body": "TORONTO/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Home sales in Canada\u2019s two largest housing markets dropped in 2017, as government measures to cool skyrocketing prices in Toronto and Vancouver restrained demand, but prices kept rising particularly in the strong condo segment.  In Toronto, sales of detached homes fell 23 percent, accounting for much of the 2017 drop, while condo sales pulled back a more muted 9.6 percent, according to a report from the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB).      The average sale price, meanwhile, jumped 12.7 percent from 2016 to C$822,681 ($657,146), with condo prices jumping 23.1 percent and detached homes climbing 12.8 percent, TREB said.  In Vancouver, the market was also split, with surging condo demand in stark contrast to slower sales of detached homes, according to a report from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver (REBGV).   Overall, sales dropped 9.9 percent compared to 2016, with the typical price of a home in the Vancouver region rising 15.9 percent to C$1,050,300. Condo prices jumped 25.9 percent, while detached homes rose 7.9 percent.  In both cities, the pace of sales picked up near the end of 2017, in part as buyers accelerated home purchases to beat new mortgage stress test requirements that started on Jan. 1.  Together, Vancouver and Toronto account for about half of house sales by volume in Canada.  Vancouver\u2019s market staggered in 2016 after the government introduced a foreign buyers tax, but the less-expensive condo market has bounced back as investors continue to fuel demand. Toronto, hit by a similar tax in 2017, is showing a similar pattern, with detached sales swooning but the condo market showing more strength.  The real estate boards said the outlook for 2018 was unclear. They said consumer sentiment could be influenced by rising interest rates and new rules around mortgage qualifications.

          "body": "JERUSALEM, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries reached agreement with Israel\u2019s Histadrut labour federation on Thursday to award preferential severance packages to company administrative staff taking voluntary redundancy, both sides said in a statement.  The move is part of a global restructuring by the world\u2019s largest generic drugmaker in which it plans to cut more than a quarter of its workforce, or some 14,000 jobs.  Under a two-year plan, Teva aims to reduce costs by $3 billion by the end of 2019, from about $16.1 billion in 2017. Some 1,700 jobs are expected to be lost in Israel and workers have protested since the cuts were announced.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Teva CEO Kare Schultz last month to try to convince the company to limit its job cuts in Israel but Schultz said it was imperative that the cuts be made to secure Teva\u2019s future and prevent exposing the company to possible takeover bids.  \u201cAfter weeks of talks, the Histadrut and the workers\u2019 committee and the company\u2019s management reached an agreement today to give the administrative staff honourable severance packages,\u201d Teva and the Histadrut said in a joint statement.  It did not say how many staff were involved in the deal but it added that if further redundancies are required beyond the voluntary stage, dismissed workers would also receive increased severance packages and other assistance to help them find other jobs.  Since the cost-cutting plan was announced last month, workers from a tablet plant in Jerusalem, which employs 500 people, and an adjacent inhaler plant about half the size, had held protests and disrupted operations.

          "body": "KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber in the Afghan capital caused dozens of casualties on Thursday after blowing himself up close to a group of security personnel who were carrying out an operation against illegal drugs and alcohol dealing, officials said.  Islamic State, which has claimed a series of attacks in Kabul over the past two years, issued a statement on its Amaq news agency saying it was responsible.  It said a suicide bomber targeting a group of police and intelligence service personnel had detonated an explosive vest, killing or wounding around 80 of them.  Wahid Majroh, a spokesman for the ministry of public health, said 11 dead and 25 wounded had been brought to city hospitals after the blast in an area of the city not far from the U.S. Embassy and other foreign missions.  As security forces arrived, a Reuters reporter saw four police vehicles carrying dead or wounded security personnel from the scene.  Police officers at the scene said the bomber had been wearing police or army uniform and had approached a group of security personnel conducting controls on illegal drugs and alcohol sellers, but there was no official confirmation.  \u201cKabul police forces were there to prevent a possible protest when a suicide bomber approached them and detonated his suicide vest,\u201d Kabul police spokesman Bashir Mujahid said.  While Afghan forces backed by U.S. air strikes have claimed some success against Taliban insurgents since the United States announced a stepped up military strategy last year, high profile attacks on civilian targets in Kabul have continued.  The attack happened days after a suicide bomber killed at least 41 people and wounded more than 80 at a Shi\u2019ite cultural center in Kabul, underlining the precarious security situation in the Afghan capital.  That attack was also claimed by Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for a number of similar attacks in Afghanistan over the past two years.

          "title": "UK social housing deal with private equity giant sparks fears for tenants",
          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Private equity giant Blackstone has struck a deal with UK social housing association Sage, sparking fears from campaigners that it will price out low-earning, elderly and sick tenants.  New York-based Blackstone, which owns the largest home rental company in the United States, will fund for-profit housing association Sage to buy affordable homes from private developers, property magazine\u00a0Estates Gazette said.  \u201c(Blackstone and Sage\u2019s) purely profit motive is contrary to the social purpose objectives of most traditional housing associations,\u201d said Tom Murtha, co-founder of SHOUT, which campaigns for more investment in social housing.  \u201cTo make the return they need ... Sage and Blackstone would increase rent beyond the means of those on low-income, in the greatest need,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  \u201cIf they acquired social housing, it would soon cease to be social housing,\u201d he said in emailed comments, referring to homes below market rent for people on low incomes.      Blackstone and Sage declined to comment.  Britain is experiencing a housing crisis as homebuilding has not kept pace with demand, driving up property prices, with rents rising faster than wages and homelessness soaring.  Local authorities housing stock has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s, with ownership of social homes shifting to private charities and housing associations.  Rising income inequality has led to poorer residents being squeezed out of central areas as wealthier inhabitants and investors snap up real estate, campaigners say.       Blackstone\u2019s 2013 purchase of hundreds of rent-controlled flats in the Spanish capital, Madrid, from the city council, sparked fears that thousands of tenants could be evicted.  The Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people in public housing in June, has prompted debate about London\u2019s stark social inequalities and whether neglect of social housing estates played a part in the disaster.  \u201cResidents and communities, post-Grenfell, need to take center stage rather than large and unaccountable for-profit landlords supported by foreign investment funds,\u201d said Kevin Gulliver, director of the Human City Institute, a think tank.  \u201cGrenfell underscored the dire consequences of the marginalisation of social housing and its decline from 33 to 17 percent of housing over the last four decades,\u201d he said in emailed comments.  On its website, Sage said that it has provided homes for 100,000 families in England and \u201cpartners with developers and managers from across the residential market, both public and private, to increase the supply of quality affordable housing\u201d.

          "title": "U.S. derivatives regulator to review bitcoin futures risks",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator will hold two meetings to discuss the procedure and operational controls for listing and trading digital currency futures, it said on Thursday, amid rising concerns over the risks bitcoin poses to the financial system.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said it would convene its technology and risk advisory committees this month to discuss its \u201cself-certification\u201d process for listing digital currency futures and how those products are risk-managed and policed.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASSA) have issued new warnings to investors over the risks of investing in bitcoin, cautioning regulators may not be able to protect them from fraudsters.   CME Group Inc (CME.O) and CBOE Global Markets Inc (CBOE.O) launched bitcoin futures in December, sparking criticism from some industry participants who said the regulator should have consulted the market more widely before allowing the products.  In December, the Futures Industry Association wrote to the CFTC expressing concern about the risks potentially posed by allowing futures in volatile virtual currencies to be traded alongside more traditional financial products.   The price of bitcoin soared to record highs of more than $19,000 in December, only to slump more than 28 percent - although it still ended the year up 1,300 percent.   The CFTC has been increasing its jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency market, which has no overriding federal regulator, but is restricted by its limited legal power to actively block exchanges from launching futures products.  CFTC regulations allow designated exchanges to list products for trading without prior CFTC approval by filing a written self-certification with the regulator.  Under the self-certification process, which is a quirk of the futures market, the exchanges file a submission to the CFTC confirming the product complies with the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations - including a key provision that requires that the contract is not susceptible to manipulation.  The CFTC has the power to block the contract but can only do so under exceptional circumstances.   The pair of advisory committee meetings are aimed at giving stakeholders the opportunity to discuss the issue.  \u201cThe responsible regulatory response to virtual currencies is consumer education, asserting CFTC authority, surveilling trading in derivative and spot markets, prosecuting fraud, abuse, manipulation and false solicitation and active coordination with fellow regulators,\u201d CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo said in the statement, adding the CFTC was following this course of action.  On Thursday, his counterpart at the SEC Jay Clayton along with Commissioners Kara Stein and Michael Piwowar, warned investors that many actors in the virtual currency market were violating state and federal laws.  \u201cThe SEC and state securities regulators are pursuing violations, but we again caution you that, if you lose money, there is a substantial risk that our efforts will not result in a recovery of your investment,\u201d they said in the statement.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facing mounting criticism that his administration understated the death toll from September\u2019s Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Thursday established a 90-day process to review the causes of thousands of recent deaths.      Rossello, through an executive order, directed Public Safety Secretary Hector Pesquera to lead an analysis of thousands of deaths that have occurred since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September. Pesquera\u2019s team is to present findings within 90 days, according to a statement issued in Spanish from Rossello\u2019s office.      \u201cAs part of the recovery process, it is important to guarantee transparency in the damages caused to the lives and safety of our citizens,\u201d Rossello said.      His administration\u2019s official death toll from the storm sits at 64. Maria - the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years - decimated local infrastructure, and nearly half the island\u2019s 3.4 million residents remain without power three-and-a-half months later.       The governor came under fire as families and nursing home officials complained that the death toll did not match anecdotal evidence of an increase in deaths as vulnerable residents struggled to get timely medical care.       A November study by a Pennsylvania State University researcher found the toll could be 10 times higher than the government\u2019s figure. A December study by the New York Times, which compared recent mortality data with historical averages, found that Maria may be responsible for as many as 1,052 deaths.       Under Rossello\u2019s executive order, Pesquera is to work with Puerto Rico\u2019s demographic registry and bureau of forensic sciences to establish procedures for the analysis.       Maria was a major blow to an already-woebegone island, whose $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt triggered the largest-ever U.S. government bankruptcy filing last May.      Puerto Rico\u2019s benchmark general obligation bond price, which already trading at a steep discount, cratered in Maria\u2019s wake, dipping to around 20 cents on the dollar. The bonds, which trade in default and carry no yield, have since edged higher to 24.995 cents on the dollar on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters data.

          "body": "OSLO (Reuters) - High ocean temperatures are harming tropical corals almost five times more often than in the 1980s, undermining reefs\u2019 ability to survive marine heat waves caused by man-made climate change, scientists said on Thursday.   The average time between severe \u201cbleachings\u201d, when heat makes the stony-bodied creatures that make up coral reefs expel colorful algae, shortened to six years in 2016 from 25-30 years in the early 1980s, the Australian-led team wrote.  Corals die if bleachings are long-lasting, wrecking reefs that are nurseries for fish, a source of food to millions of people and a destination for scuba-diving tourists.  \u201cTropical reef systems are transitioning to a new era in which the interval between recurrent bouts of coral bleaching is too short for a full recovery\u201d of mature corals that can require 10-15 years, the researchers wrote in the journal Science.  Climate change will \u201cinevitably\u201d make underwater heat waves and bleachings more frequent, they wrote.  The worst bleaching was in 2015-16, when record ocean temperatures affected 75 percent of 100 reefs studied from Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef to the Caribbean.  Lead author Professor Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia, urged more action to limit greenhouse gas emissions under the global 2015 Paris climate agreement.  The main problem for protecting reefs was \u201cweak commitments for reductions in emissions from individual countries like Australia and the U.S.,\u201d he told Reuters in an e-mail.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts climate change is man-made, plans to pull out of the Paris accord and instead promote U.S. fossil fuels. Australia\u2019s goals under the Paris accord are less ambitious than those of some other rich nations.  The Paris pact seeks to limit a rise in average global surface temperatures to \u201cwell below\u201d two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, ideally 1.5C (2.7F) by shifting from fossil fuels.   Corals are already under threat with warming of 1C (1.8F) so far, a U.N. panel of climate scientists says.  In the 1980s, bleachings happened during local heat waves, and then started to occur in the 1980s and 1990s during natural El Nino weather events that release heat from the Pacific Ocean.  \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing the emergence of bleaching in every hot summer,\u201d said Mark Eakin, an author of the study at the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, said in a statement.      Hughes said there was evidence that some corals could adapt to rising temperatures. The Great Barrier Reef, the world\u2019s biggest, was not doomed if governments stepped up action.  \u201cIf the ... Paris Agreement is successful we will still have a Great Barrier Reef. It will have a different mix of coral species, but it will still function and look like a reef,\u201d he said.  Study available at: here; Reporting By Alister Doyle, Editing by William Maclean"

          "body": "In a memo to staff on Thursday, Reuters Executive Editor for Professional News Amy Stevens announced the appointment of five Global Industry Editors. Read more below:  Dear all,  At the core of our company news revamp is a commitment to globalizing our approach to corporate coverage. The reorganization plan announced last fall was designed \u2013 with input from you and our customers \u2013 to help Reuters operate more seamlessly across time zones and borders and better connect the dots along worldwide supply chains and among multinational competitors. Today I\u2019m pleased to share the names of five of the Global Industry Editors (GIEs) who will lead that effort; we expect to announce the other two by the end of January.  As we\u2019ve explained, these senior journalists will each run a virtual bureau of reporters spanning our three regions, establishing coverage priorities for their sector to correspond with the needs of our customers. Along with the Companies Breaking News Editors and Companies Top News Editors announced a couple of weeks ago, the Global Industry Editors will set Reuters up for success from the first break onward. Their collective goal: to ensure that our corporate news file is second to none when it comes to speed, fairness and accuracy \u2013 as well as distinctiveness and depth.  You\u2019ll see from their CV\u2019s that the GIEs are an impressive bunch. Collectively they have decades of experience covering business. They have worked at a variety of news organizations and across geographies. As reporters \u2013 or as editors directing reporters \u2013 they have been responsible for landing world-beating scoops and have probed deeply into corporate board rooms and regulatory filings. Most already have deep expertise in their sectors, which will position them well to lead from the front. Here are the first fab five, in alphabetical order:  - Amran Abocar: GIE, Mining \u2013 based in Toronto. Amran has been Canada Bureau Chief since 2014, leading a team that won a SABEW award for its companies coverage and shortlisted for enterprise stories on prison reform and Canadian miners in Latin America. Prior to her current role, she worked in Asia as Deputy Commodities Editor and in the Middle East, as Gulf Deputy Bureau Chief, covering everything from Dubai\u2019s debt implosion and the Arab Spring to nationalist mining policies in Indonesia. In addition to her new role, Amran remains Canada Bureau Chief for an interim period. Born in Somalia, she is an avid reader and sports fan who remains inexplicably loyal to Ipswich despite it all.  - Tim Hepher: GIE, Airlines \u2013 based in Paris. Tim has been at Reuters since 1994, covering aviation for the past 12 years, including as a team leader for the past five years. During his time with the company, Tim has mainly covered commodities, companies news, the economy and trade, based in France or Italy \u2013 although he is from London. Before Reuters he covered the oil industry and OPEC for Platt\u2019s.\u00a0  - Richard Mably: GIE, Energy \u2013 based in London. As previously announced, Richard is adding the Energy GIE role to his current responsibilities as global editor for financial markets, commodities and polling, which he took on in 2017.

          "title": "Puerto Rico sets 90-day target for review of hurricane deaths",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facing mounting criticism that his administration understated the death toll from September\u2019s Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Thursday established a 90-day process to review the causes of thousands of recent deaths.      Rossello, through an executive order, directed Public Safety Secretary Hector Pesquera to lead an analysis of thousands of deaths that have occurred since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September. Pesquera\u2019s team is to present findings within 90 days, according to a statement issued in Spanish from Rossello\u2019s office.      \u201cAs part of the recovery process, it is important to guarantee transparency in the damages caused to the lives and safety of our citizens,\u201d Rossello said.      His administration\u2019s official death toll from the storm sits at 64. Maria - the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years - decimated local infrastructure, and nearly half the island\u2019s 3.4 million residents remain without power three-and-a-half months later.       The governor came under fire as families and nursing home officials complained that the death toll did not match anecdotal evidence of an increase in deaths as vulnerable residents struggled to get timely medical care.       A November study by a Pennsylvania State University researcher found the toll could be 10 times higher than the government\u2019s figure. A December study by the New York Times, which compared recent mortality data with historical averages, found that Maria may be responsible for as many as 1,052 deaths.       Under Rossello\u2019s executive order, Pesquera is to work with Puerto Rico\u2019s demographic registry and bureau of forensic sciences to establish procedures for the analysis.       Maria was a major blow to an already-woebegone island, whose $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt triggered the largest-ever U.S. government bankruptcy filing last May.      Puerto Rico\u2019s benchmark general obligation bond price, which already trading at a steep discount, cratered in Maria\u2019s wake, dipping to around 20 cents on the dollar. The bonds, which trade in default and carry no yield, have since edged higher to 24.995 cents on the dollar on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The safety board also said the crash that killed three and injured 70 could have been prevented if a safety technology system known as positive train control had been operational.  The board previously said Amtrak 501 was traveling at 78 miles per hour (126 km per hour) when it derailed, far above the 30 mph speed limit.

The NTSB reported last month that six seconds before the derailment off a bridge and onto a highway, the engineer remarked that the train was speeding.

          "body": "Amid ever-heightening tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, there are finally some positive diplomatic signals. On Jan. 3, Pyongyang reopened a long-closed border hotline with South Korea \u2013 one day after Seoul proposed bilateral negotiations and two days after Kim Jong Un said in his New Year address that he was open to speaking with the South.  Yet when asked about this possible breakthrough, United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley threw cold water on the whole idea: \u201cWe won\u2019t take any of the talk seriously if they don't do something to ban all nuclear weapons in North Korea.\u201d  Haley\u2019s statement is as clear an articulation of the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy as you can get: Diplomacy is a waste of time; we will only talk to adversaries after they unilaterally capitulate and obey all our commands. The problem is that this approach is rarely effective. Sure, sometimes diplomacy fails, but more often than not, blustery intimidation elicits nothing but bluster and resistance in return.  Consider Washington\u2019s post-World War Two approach to the Soviet Union. According to the historian\u00a0Melvyn P. Leffler,\u00a0there was \u201cnearly universal agreement\u201d in the military and intelligence communities that the Soviet Union, though expansionist, \u201cwas by no means uniformly hostile or unwilling to negotiate with the United States.\u201d Yet, in contrast to the internal consensus, Leffler cites U.S. officials increasingly depicting Moscow\u00a0as \"constitutionally incapable of being conciliated\" and hell-bent on \u201cworld domination.\u201d  In July 1947, a War Department intelligence report found the Truman administration\u2019s more confrontational approach \u201ctend[ed] to magnify the significance of conflicting points of view, and reduc[ed] the possibility of agreement on any point.\u201d According to Leffler, this \u201chad resulted in a more aggressive Soviet attitude toward the United States and had intensified tensions.\u201d  By contrast, history is replete with examples of tactful statecraft successfully yielding major concessions from adversaries.  Although the Cuban missile crisis had for decades been misrepresented as an example of a steely-eyed American president staring down a retreating Soviet Union, the truth was later\u00a0revealed\u00a0in declassified documents. John F. Kennedy secretly offered to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey, while Russia\u2019s Nikita Khrushchev agreed to take the missiles out of Cuba in exchange. Nuclear war was averted through diplomacy and mutual concessions.  President Barack Obama\u2019s approach to Iran was successful because it followed this diplomatic model. For years, Washington approached Iran with obstinate condemnations, extreme demands, and little interest in serious negotiations. This all-sticks-no-carrots posture resulted in stubborn hostility on both sides and an expanding Iranian nuclear program. Only when the Obama administration conceded Iran\u2019s right to peaceful civilian nuclear enrichment and offered sanctions relief did Tehran agree to\u00a0major restrictions\u00a0on its nuclear program. This resulted in what Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency,\u00a0describes\u00a0as \u201cthe world\u2019s most robust nuclear verification regime.\u201d  So why is Trump ignoring his predecessor\u2019s example? A popular argument against the prospect of rapprochement with North Korea is that we tried diplomacy in the 1990s and Pyongyang took advantage of American overtures and failed to live up to its commitments.  But that is an\u00a0incredibly misleading\u00a0representation of the 1994 Agreed Framework. Negotiated by the Clinton administration, the Agreed Framework froze Pyongyang\u2019s plutonium pathway to a nuclear bomb and opened its program up to inspections in exchange for economic and diplomatic concessions from Washington. Unfortunately, according to Stanford University\u2019s\u00a0Siegfried S. Hecker, many in Congress opposed the deal and \u201cfailed to appropriate funds for key provisions of the pact, causing the United States to fall behind in its commitments almost from the beginning.\u201d  Pyongyang took this as a signal that it needed a back-up plan. Early in the George W. Bush administration, which took a\u00a0markedly tougher line\u00a0from the start, U.S. intelligence found Pyongyang was secretly developing uranium enrichment capabilities, which violated the spirit, though not the letter, of the Agreed Framework. The Bush team pulled out of the deal in response, prompting Pyongyang to expel international inspectors.  In 2002, Bush put North Korea in the infamous \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d, which strongly implied a future regime change effort. Pyongyang soon after\u00a0withdrew\u00a0from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and only a few years later, the Kim regime tested\u00a0its first nuclear weapon.  Diplomatic efforts have a better track record, even with North Korea. North Korea tends to respond to toughness and attempts at coercion with its own set of belligerent policies. However, over the past 25 years, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, periods of diplomacy correlate with a reduction in North Korean provocations. Simply put, the Trump administration\u2019s central premise on North Korea is wrong. More threats and pressure won\u2019t elicit surrender from Pyongyang. In fact, the estimated\u00a0costs of war\u00a0are so\u00a0catastrophically high\u00a0that military threats at this point are probably not credible. The CIA\u00a0assesses\u00a0\u201cno amount of economic sanctions will force the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, to give up his country\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d  Diplomatic options are readily available. Americans involved in low-level discussions with North Korea have repeatedly said\u00a0Pyongyang is willing to negotiate. Russia and China have long insisted that the best first step to constructive diplomacy is an initial \u201cfreeze for freeze\u201d\u00a0agreement, in which Pyongyang would agree to freeze its weapons testing in exchange for a halt to all U.S.-South Korean military exercises. While U.S. military commanders do not support a total freeze, South Korea has suggested postponing some exercises until after the Olympics. In addition, Washington could easily halt its provocative \u2013 and superfluous \u2013 overflight operations near North Korea.  The exact outlines of a deal\u00a0would have to be defined\u00a0at the negotiating table, when each side can communicate its own expectations and flexibility. But the United States has wide latitude to satisfy North Korean security concerns, including offering an end to what Pyongyang calls Washington\u2019s \u201chostile policy,\u201d\u00a0sanctions relief, or even a\u00a0reduction in U.S. troop levels\u00a0in South Korea. The latter may appeal to China, which could\u00a0motivate a more constructive Chinese approach\u00a0to the North Korean problem.  Nothing about the current situation on the Korean peninsula forces us to take an exclusively hardline approach. Only pride, honor, and terribly wrong ideas about diplomacy prevent a more sensible approach.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Emboldened by his victory in the passage of the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in decades, President Donald Trump now wants to rein in social welfare programs even though some Republicans are wary of tackling the volatile issue in a congressional election year.  A White House-led drive to downsize government aid programs such as food stamps and housing subsidies would energize conservative campaign donors whose support Republicans are counting on ahead of the November elections where the party will fight to keep control of Congress.  White House aides say Trump is eager to take on welfare. He has a willing partner in House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who has long had an interest in the issue.  But some Republicans believe Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is lukewarm on the drive for revising welfare, which might face a difficult sell in the Senate where Republicans hold only a razor-thin 51-49 majority.  Democrats already are attacking Trump for identifying welfare changes as his top 2018 goal, saying they are designed to help pay for tax cuts whose benefits are skewed toward corporations and wealthy individuals and which will add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years.      Trump has summoned Republican congressional leaders to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland this weekend to discuss 2018 priorities, including welfare and a planned effort on infrastructure investment.      Conservative House Republicans are especially enthusiastic about a welfare overhaul. Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows and the caucus\u2019 former leader, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan, have discussed it with Trump and are confident the Republican president backs their ideas, such as strengthening work requirements for food stamps.  \u201cHe definitely gets it,\u201d Jordan said.  But Republicans may need to tread carefully in seeking to reduce government aid programs that benefit some of Trump\u2019s core supporters in poor, rural regions of the country.  Republican Representative Tom Cole said Congress had a lot on its plate in the early months of 2018, including must-pass budget legislation and he was unsure there would be the time - or political will in the Senate - to pass welfare legislation.  \u201cFirst things first,\u201d Cole said, adding it might be better to lay the groundwork for debate over the issue than to try enacting changes this year.  Meadows said he believed a welfare overhaul had strong support among Republican lawmakers but that \u201cconvincing Mitch McConnell and the Democrats are Herculean tasks.\u201d  Other Republicans and interest groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers think 2018 would be better spent on infrastructure.  Trump\u2019s first major legislative victory - the tax bill - took until the end of 2017. But handing out tax breaks might be far easier than revamping welfare assistance that benefits millions of American families.  Last year, there were more than 42 million people in nearly 21 million U.S. households receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, which are known as food stamps, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  They cost taxpayers about $58 billion.  Trump\u2019s budget proposal last year called for cutting more than $192 billion from SNAP over a decade.  The president also proposed deep cuts to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which last year provided aid to 1.1 million families.  Democratic strategist Doug Thornell said a push on welfare could trigger a political backlash for Republicans from elderly and blue-collar voters in the November congressional elections.  Thornell said it may appeal to Trump\u2019s political base \u201cbut few else. And the irony here is that it will be Trump\u2019s base who will feel the brunt of these cuts.\u201d      Robert Doar, a poverty specialist at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute who has been in contact with Trump administration officials about policy ideas, urged an incremental approach.  Although Doar said he did not know what policies the administration would ultimately back, he said Trump could encourage people to get jobs by reducing the length of their qualification for government aid and imposing stricter reviews of their efforts to find work.  He said Congress could pass legislation cutting benefits for people who fail to make enough effort to find jobs or do volunteer work.  Some have argued that food stamp beneficiaries, for example, already include a high rate of people who hold jobs but are unable to make ends meet.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hip hop and R&B surpassed rock for the first time in 2017 as the biggest music genre in the United States, but British artist Ed Sheeran\u2019s romantic pop album \u201cDivide\u201d was the year\u2019s biggest single draw, according to a Nielsen Music report.  Powered by a 72 percent increase in on-demand audio streaming, eight of the top 10 albums came from the world of rap  or R&B, including Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cDAMN,\u201d Drake\u2019s \u201cMore Life\u201d and \u201c24K Magic\u201d by Bruno Mars, according to Nielsen Music\u2019s  2017 year-end report, released on Wednesday.  Rap and R&B also dominate the Grammy awards later in January, with rapper Jay-Z and Lamar leading nominations.  In a reflection of the demise of rock among young people, the Coachella music festival line-up announced earlier this week featured no rock headliner for the first time in the 19-year history of the three-day Southern California event.  Pop star Taylor Swift had the biggest album of 2017 in terms of sales with \u201cReputation,\u201d with 1.9 million units sold, Nielsen said. The album, Swift\u2019s first in three years, was kept off streaming for the first three weeks after its release in November.  But it was Sheeran whose music dominated radio, digital and streaming in 2017. \u201cDivide\u201d notched up 2.7 million units, including sales and streaming activity, and the 26 year-old singer-songwriter\u2019s single \u201cShape of You\u201d spent 33 weeks on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart and was streamed one billion times.  Billboard charts tally units from album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album).  Vinyl sales surged for a 12th year in a row - up 9 percent in 2017 - especially among older fans. The top selling vinyl albums were The Beatles \u201cSgt.Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band,\u201d powered by a 50th anniversary reissue, and the British band\u2019s 1969 release, \u201cAbbey Road.\u201d  Reporting by Jill Serjeant"

          "title": "Neurontin prescriptions surge amid opioid crisis",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - Prescriptions for nerve pain medicines like Neurontin and Lyrica have more than tripled in recent years, driven by increased use among chronically ill older adults and patients already taking opioids, a U.S. study suggests.  The proportion of U.S. adults prescribed Neurontin and other drugs in the same family of medicines climbed from 1.2 percent in 2002 to 3.9 percent by 2015, a period that also saw a surge in opioid overdoses and deaths. The family of medicines, known as gabapentinoids, includes gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant) and pregabalin.   \u201cNearly one in 25 adults takes a gabapentinoid during a year, which matters because we have little data to support much use of this drug class and minimal data to support the long-term safety of the medications,\u201d said study author Dr. Michael Johansen of the Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine at Ohio University in Athens.   \u201cMy suspicion is that much of the use is driven by attempting to treat chronic pain with a non-opioid medication,\u201d Johansen said by email.   U.S. deaths from opioids including heroin and prescription drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone and methadone have more than quadrupled since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Today, more than six in 10 drug overdose deaths involve opioids.   Amid this worsening opioid epidemic, the CDC has urged physicians to prescribe other drugs for pain including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as gabapentinoids.   Gabapentin and pregabalin both have won U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treating partial seizures and a type of nerve pain caused by shingles. A version of gabapentin has also been approved for restless leg syndrome, and pregabalin has additional approvals for fibromyalgia and nerve pain related to diabetes and spinal cord injuries.   While the FDA doesn\u2019t allow drug companies to promote these medicines for other conditions, doctors are free to prescribe the drugs for off-label, or unapproved, uses.  Off-label use of gabapentinoids has been controversial, however, because these drugs can be addictive, they haven\u2019t been proven effective for many common unapproved uses and there\u2019s limited long-term safety data, Johansen writes in JAMA Internal Medicine.   For his study, Johansen reviewed survey data from a nationally representative sample of 346,177 adults, including details on any medical conditions and prescriptions.   Overall, more than four out of five of prescriptions for gabapentinoids were for gabapentin, the analysis found.   Prescription growth was concentrated among older adults, diabetics, people with multiple chronic health problems and patients already taking opioids or benzodiazepines like Valium and Xanax.   One limitation of the study is that it relied on participants to accurately report on any drug use, and it\u2019s possible that some people did not disclose opioid use. The study didn\u2019t include prescription records or information on drug costs.   \u201cThe use of gabapentinoids specifically seems to be outpacing any proven efficacy and the potential significant harms like addiction and overdose are only beginning to be investigated,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Goodman, a researcher at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine in Columbia who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   While some patients may benefit from these drugs, they should consider other approaches to pain management like exercise, physical therapy and yoga that may be safer and still provide some relief, Goodman said by email.   Side effects of gabapentinoids include sedation, dizziness and trouble thinking, Dr. Chad Brummett, an opioid researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. The risks are worse at higher doses.   Mixing these drugs with opioids and benzodiazapines may make them even more dangerous, said Marissa Seamans, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.  \u201cGabapentinoids are increasingly prescribed to patients with opioids and benzodiazapines, which increases the risk of respiratory depression and death,\u201d Seamans said by email. \u201cClinicians and patients need to carefully monitor the dosage of these medicines, their interactions, and potentially fatal side effects.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2Ar8g2m JAMA Internal Medicine, online January 2, 2018.

The owner of more than 40 multinational retail brands including Conforama, Mattress Firm and Poundland, revealed the \u201caccounting irregularity\u201d last month along with the immediate departure of its chief executive. Its chairman briefly took the reins then also stepped down.  \u201cWhile the Group has achieved some degree of stabilization in its operating businesses, significant near-term liquidity is still required in certain of the business units,\u201d Steinhoff said on Thursday.  Chief financial officer Ben la Grange, whom the company has cleared of any wrongdoing, will leave his position and Philip Dieperink, the finance chief of Steinhoff\u2019s UK business, will become acting CFO.  The company said la Grange would concentrate on \u201cthe preservation and procurement of liquidity in the group\u201d and finalizing its 2017 accounts.  Turnaround specialist AlixPartners was called in last month to help shore up finances as lenders have started restricting access to credit lines and insurers are cancelling or reducing credit insurance.  Steinhoff, which has debts of around 10.7 billion euros, said it planned to hire a debt restructuring expert in the role of chief restructuring officer.        Earlier this week, Steinhoff said it would have to restate its 2015 accounts and maybe even earlier figures, having already warned on its 2016 numbers.  More than $10 billion has been wiped off Steinhoff\u2019s market value following the disclosure of the scandal that has claimed the heads of CEO Markus Jooste and chairman Christo Wiese. They were key figures who transformed Steinhoff from a modest furniture distributor to a global household goods giant.  Shares in Steinhoff, still down about 80 percent from a month ago, rebounded more than 25 percent on Thursday to 8.60 rand.  This week UK subsidiary Poundland reported strong Christmas trading and European unit, Pepkor Europe, which houses Poundland and Dealz, said it had replaced planned investment from its parent in full with a new independent 180 million pound loan.   Meanwhile, the company\u2019s Asia Pacific subsidiary has hired lawyers and a restructuring specialist to advise on the \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d facing its parent.    Steinhoff has so far raised around $400 million from the sale of a portion of its stake in South African investment heavyweight PSG Group (PSGJ.J). It is also due to receive around $1.2 billion in debt repayment from its subsidiary, Steinhoff Africa Retail.  The company, which moved its primary share listing from Johannesburg to Frankfurt two years ago, has been under investigation for suspected accounting fraud in Germany since 2015. Four current and former managers are under suspicion of having overstated revenues at subsidiaries, prosecutors have said.

          "body": "(Adds information and quote from interview)  By Ana Mano  SAO PAULO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The volume of Banco Santander Brasil\u2019s farm loans rose about 44 percent last year as the Spanish bank\u2019s local unit grew its presence in the country\u2019s booming agribusiness sector, an executive said on Thursday.  Carlos Aguiar, head of agribusiness lending, said the growth catapulted the bank to become the fifth-largest provider of farm loans in Latin America\u2019s biggest economy.  Santander\u2019s loans to farmers and agribusiness companies stood at 13 billion reais ($4 billion) at the end of last year, up from 9 billion reais in 2016.  The bank\u2019s farm lending in Brazil could grow between 10 percent and 15 percent in 2018, Aguiar said, as lower interest rates provide opportunities for private-sector banks to expand in a segment still dominated by state-run banks.  \u201cThe fall of the Selic base rate is accelerating our strategy,\u201d Aguiar told Reuters in a telephone interview.  Brazil\u2019s central bank reduced the benchmark interest rate to an all-time low of 7 percent in December, the latest in a long cycle of cuts that began in October 2016 amid government efforts to kick-start the economy.  With loans tailored to farmers and agribusinesses, Aguiar said the bank expects to thrive in the only sector relatively unscathed from Brazil\u2019s deepest recession in decades from 2015 to 2017.  Santander announced plans to open 16 \u201cagro-stores\u201d focused on selling financial products to farmers in the country last year, 14 of which have now been launched. About a third of those will be in the state of Mato Grosso, where recently grain growers have relied more on the barter system to finance their crop.  Under barter, multinational commodities trading firms and agriculture product resellers supply inputs to farmers in exchange for securing future delivery of a portion of their crops.  For the first time since the 2008/2009 crop season, barter represented more than half of crop financing for producers in the state, according to Imea, a research agency based in Brazil\u2019s largest grain producing state.  \u201cBarter is only used in Brazil,\u201d Aguiar said, adding the bank can offer loan options potentially more competitive to producers.  State-run Banco do Brasil SA remains Brazil\u2019s largest rural credit provider, with about 66 percent of farm loans totaling 188 billion reais as of last October, according a ranking compiled by bank association Febraban.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Western Union Co (WU.N) will pay $60 million to resolve allegations that it failed for more than a decade to maintain a program to deter and report transactions involving suspected criminal fraud and money laundering, New York\u2019s financial regulator said on Thursday.  The settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) follows the money-transfer company\u2019s agreement in January 2017 to pay $586 million to resolve similar claims by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.  DFS alleged that from 2004 to 2012, Western Union failed to implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program aimed to deter criminals\u2019 use of its electronic network to facilitate fraud and money laundering.  The regulator said senior Western Union executives and managers also ignored suspicious transactions to Chinese Western Union locations by several high-volume agents, including money transfers linked to human trafficking.  DFS Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement Western Union\u2019s executive \u201cput profits ahead of the company\u2019s responsibilities to detect and prevent money laundering and fraud.\u201d  As part of the settlement, Western Union must submit a written plan to DFS aimed at ensuring the adequacy of its anti-money laundering and anti-fraud programs. It must also submit progress reports to DFS.  Western Union said in a statement it had previously set aside $49 million to resolve the investigation. It also said that it had made substantial improvements aimed at enhancing its compliance programs.  As part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department announced in January 2017, Western Union admitted it violated U.S. laws.  The company also agreed in January 2017 to pay $5 million to various state attorneys general to reimburse investigative, enforcement and other costs in connection with related investigations.

Powered by a 72 percent increase in on-demand audio streaming, eight of the top 10 albums came from the world of rap  or R&B, including Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cDAMN,\u201d Drake\u2019s \u201cMore Life\u201d and \u201c24K Magic\u201d by Bruno Mars, according to Nielsen Music\u2019s  2017 year-end report, released on Wednesday.  Rap and R&B also dominate the Grammy awards later in January, with rapper Jay-Z and Lamar leading nominations.  In a reflection of the demise of rock among young people, the Coachella music festival line-up announced earlier this week featured no rock headliner for the first time in the 19-year history of the three-day Southern California event.  Pop star Taylor Swift had the biggest album of 2017 in terms of sales with \u201cReputation,\u201d with 1.9 million units sold, Nielsen said. The album, Swift\u2019s first in three years, was kept off streaming for the first three weeks after its release in November.

Billboard charts tally units from album sales, song sales (10 songs equal one album) and streaming activity (1,500 streams equal one album).  Vinyl sales surged for a 12th year in a row - up 9 percent in 2017 - especially among older fans.

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German TV director Dieter Wedel has denied accusations of sexual harassment and assault in Germany\u2019s first such case since a scandal involving Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein unleashed a global wave of abuse allegations in the entertainment and media worlds.  The 75-year-old Wedel, who made several hit German TV series, was accused in the magazine of Die Zeit weekly by actresses Patricia Thielemann and Jany Tempel of sexual assault in separate incidents in his hotel rooms in 1991 and 1996.  Wedel denied the allegations in a statement issued by his lawyers and published on the website of the Bad Hersfeld theater festival that he has run since 2015.  \u201cThe allegations made against him by several actresses are inaccurate and unjustified. He has never been violent in any way to these or any other women,\u201d the lawyers\u2019 statement said.  The lawyers said he regretted that he had sometimes subjected actors and actresses to tough and even insulting criticism on set, but said that this never had any connection to the alleged attacks.  As many women around the world and some men shared accounts of harassment in the wake of abuse allegations against Weinstein, Wedel said in November he himself had been harassed by gay directors and actors as a young man but had resisted.  Weinstein, accused of sexual harassment by more than 50 women, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.  Reporting by Emma Thomasson; editing by Mark Heinrich"

          "title": "Tesla Model 3 delay raises cashflow risks, but analysts upbeat",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares recouped some of their losses on Thursday after falling as much as 3.6 percent, a day after it pushed back a production target for its much-anticipated Model 3 sedan yet again.  Analysts stayed upbeat, saying the electric car maker had finally set an achievable target for their mass-market sedan that is priced at $35,000. The delay, however, is likely to impact Tesla\u2019s cashflow, a big challenge for many quarters now.  Tesla said on Wednesday it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. The company now expects to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.  \u201cWith absolute Model 3 sales tracking behind expectations and Model 3 gross margin improvement likely to be pushed out until production reaches greater scale, the expected cash tailwind from Model 3 will take longer to manifest itself than was anticipated,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst George Galliers said in a note.  Tesla, headed by Elon Musk, has been struggling to overcome production bottlenecks and reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss in the July-September quarter.  The company burned through $1.1 billion in cash in that quarter and said in November it would spend roughly the same amount in the fourth quarter. It had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30.  Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja had reassured investors that cash flow would \u201cimprove significantly\u201d over the next few quarters as Tesla continued to ramp up Model 3 production.  Tesla shares were down at $313.02 in afternoon trading. The median price target on the stock is $310 and eight of 25 brokerages covering the stock rate it \u201cbuy\u201d or higher. Eight have a \u201chold\u201d rating and the rest a \u201csell\u201d or lower.  \u201cWe believe that Tesla may have finally set a beatable production target,\u201d Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a note.  \u201cImportantly, we believe that Tesla is prioritizing quality control. While Tesla\u2019s repeated guidance revisions could begin to risk damaging its elite brand, a mass-recall would probably be far more damaging,\u201d he said.  Tesla\u2019s luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory and quality checks have routinely revealed defects in nearly all of these models inspected after assembly, Reuters reported in November, citing sources.  Tesla has maintained that its quality control process is unusually rigorous.      Analysts said on Thursday they continue to believe that sales of the Model 3 sedan could transform the niche automaker into a mass producer, giving it an edge over a host of rivals such as General Motors Co (GM.N) and BMW (BMWG.DE) who are entering the nascent electric car market.  \u201cGiven that TSLA received over 400k Model 3 reservations with essentially no marketing, we believe potential demand for the vehicle is likely underestimated, and think TSLA could significantly increase demand through its own advertising in the future,\u201d Baird Equity Research analyst Ben Kallo said.

          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico\u2019s government on Wednesday denounced forecast price hikes by fuel retailers and tortilla makers, saying increases were unjustified as it sought to allay public concern about high inflation at the start of a presidential election year.  Prices for corn tortillas, the Mexican staple, are forecast to rise in the coming days by between nearly 11 and 21 percent, according to figures from the National Union of Industrial Mills and Tortillas.  Meanwhile, gasoline and diesel prices are seen by one retail association rising an average of about 7 percent this year due to tax changes, volatility of the peso currency and higher crude prices.  \u201cThat they say they are now going to hike prices is unjustified. We don\u2019t see the market conditions for this to happen,\u201d said Jose Rogelio Garza, a deputy economy minister.  The forecast from the Mexican Association of Gasoline Businesses (AMEGAS) was quickly dismissed as false in a statement by state-run oil company Pemex, but that did not stop complaints.  \u201cMy suppliers bring me the dough by car and if gasoline prices go up then obviously they are going to have to adjust their prices,\u201d said Jorge Garcia, the owner of a Mexico City bakery.  The price of liquefied natural gas, used for cooking, rose by an average of 25 percent in 2017, while electricity rates have also inched up, according to government data.  \u201cWith increasing gas prices we\u2019re going to have to make adjustments... I can\u2019t work without gas,\u201d said Garcia.  As inflation hovers near a 16-year high at just below 7 percent, officials insisted the forecast price spikes, which have triggered social media outrage and threats of protests, are not warranted.  \u201cIn 2018, variations in international fuel prices will continue to be cushioned,\u201d the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday, emphasizing a scheme that allows it to reduce a key excise tax applied to fuel sales.  With presidential elections looming in July, the government is especially sensitive to the possibility that protests could further erode its support among voters.  But beyond rhetoric, the government is mostly powerless to force the hands of gas station owners as its ability to set prices ended in late November after it finalized a gradual, nationwide fuel liberalization.  The move to market prices, part of sweeping 2013-2014 energy reform, ending a transitional period during which it still set maximum gasoline and diesel prices.  The fuel regulator, or CRE, said in a statement that prices in central Mexico for Pemex\u2019s Magna gasoline, which makes up more than 80 percent of total sales, have only risen 1.3 percent compared to average prices at the end of November, an increase it described as stable.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The CRE reported that the average nationwide price on Tuesday for Magna stood at 16.13 pesos per liter.  That works out to about $3.15 per gallon at the current exchange rate.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For many years prior to the passage of the energy reform, fuel prices in Mexico were set by the government and were the same across the country.

The 30-member blue-chip index crossed five 1,000-point marks in 2017, on the back of President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda and solid corporate earnings.  Wall Street carried the momentum into the new year, with the benchmark S&P index closing above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settling above 7,000 a day earlier.  \u201cThe point that people need to take is that the macro indicators are telling investors that world economies are doing really well,\u201d said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.  \u201cAs the index (Dow) goes ever high in time, it is going to be less and less meaningful.\u201d  Strong manufacturing and services sector data from the world\u2019s largest economies helped global shares climb to new levels on Thursday.  A report showed U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December and planned layoffs by American-based companies fell sharply, pointing to sustained labor market strength.  Private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, according to the ADP National Employment Report, above the 190,000 additions forecast by economists polled by Reuters.  Focus will shift to the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report, which is expected on Friday.  At 12:32 p.m. ET (1732 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 133.39 points, or 0.54 percent, at 25,056.07 and the S&P 500 was up 11.31 points, or 0.42 percent, at 2,724.37. The Nasdaq Composite was up 10.41 points, or 0.15 percent, at 7,075.94.  Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by 1.4 percent gain in the financial index.  Wells Fargo and JPMorgan rose about 1.5 percent and Goldman Sachs 1.3 percent after the strong data raised the odds of a March rate hike.  Victoria\u2019s Secret-owner L Brands slid 12.5 percent on disappointing quarterly earnings forecast.  Macy\u2019s shares fell 7 percent after reporting only modest growth in holiday sales and said it would close stores and slash thousands of jobs this year.  Other department store operators including J.C. Penney Co Inc also tumbled.  Sprint fell about 5 percent after the wireless carrier appointed former Altice NV Chief Executive Michel Combes as chief financial officer.  Intel declined as much as 5 percent, adding to Wednesday\u2019s losses that was triggered by a report that its chips were vulnerable to being hacked.  Rival Advanced Micro Devices rose 5.4 percent.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,729 to 1,087. On the Nasdaq, 1,648 issues rose and 1,264 fell.  Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj\nKalluvila"

          "body": "(Reuters) - The global private equity industry raised a record $453 billion from investors in 2017, leaving it with more than $1 trillion to pour into companies and new business ventures, data from industry tracker Preqin showed on Thursday.  The figures underscore the extent to which large institutional investors, as well as family offices, are placing a growing portion of their money with leveraged buyout firms, venture capital groups and growth equity funds, which are promising returns that beat the wider stock market.  The money raised in 2017 surpassed the previous landmark of $414 billion set in 2007.   However, there were a quarter fewer new private equity funds launched last year than in 2016, with fundraising boosted by so-called mega buyout funds, defined by Preqin as having assets of at least $4.5 billion.   Chief amount these funds was Apollo Global Management LLC\u2019s (APO.N) $24.6 billion Investment Fund IX, the largest private equity fund ever launched.  The buoyant fundraising market has fostered fierce competition for deals to put investment capital to work, driving up acquisition prices that can erode potential returns.  \u201cEntry prices for assets remain very high, and with so much available capital competing for deals, this will only increase the challenge for fund managers looking to deploy capital in 2018,\u201d a Preqin analyst wrote.   Nevertheless, David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-executive chairman of Carlyle Group LP (CG.O), one of the largest private equity firms, has expressed confidence about the industry\u2019s ability to put new money to work.  \u201cFor the last 15 or 20 years, very often, before firms like ours were publicly traded even, people were worried about whether you could deploy this capital,\u201d Rubenstein said at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) conference last month. \u201cNow it turns out that the capital can be deployed.\u201d  His confidence stems from what he described as investors\u2019 willingness to accept returns in the mid-teens as opposed to at least 20 percent in the past.   Private equity firms are also showing an increasing appetite for taking non-controlling positions in companies, which expands the field of possible investments.  In addition, Rubenstein said firms are making more investments outside of the United States, while putting a greater focus on improving the operational performance of portfolio companies, which should increase their re-sale value.

Until that moment, Gruss and colleagues Moritz Lipp and Michael Schwarz had thought such an attack on the processor\u2019s \u2018kernel\u2019 memory, which is meant to be inaccessible to users, was only theoretically possible.  \u201cWhen I saw my private website addresses from Firefox being dumped by the tool I wrote, I was really shocked,\u201d Gruss told Reuters in an email interview, describing how he had unlocked personal data that should be secured.  Gruss, Lipp and Schwarz, working from their homes on a weekend in early December, messaged each other furiously to verify the result.  \u201cWe sat for hours in disbelief until we eliminated any possibility that this result was wrong,\u201d said Gruss, whose mind kept racing even after powering down his computer, so he barely caught a wink of sleep.  Gruss and his colleagues had just confirmed the existence of what he regards as \u201cone of the worst CPU bugs ever found\u201d.  The flaw, now named Meltdown, was revealed on Wednesday and affects most processors manufactured by Intel since 1995.  Separately, a second defect called Spectre has been found that also exposes core memory in most computers and mobile devices running on chips made by Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (AMD.O) and ARM Holdings, a unit of Japan\u2019s Softbank (9984.T).   Both would enable a hacker to access secret passwords or photos from desktops, laptops, cloud servers or smartphones. It\u2019s not known whether criminals have been able to carry out such attacks as neither Meltdown nor Spectre leave any traces in log files.  Intel says it has started providing software and firmware updates to mitigate the security issues. ARM has also said it was working with AMD and Intel on security fixes.  The discovery was originally reported by online tech journal The Register. As a result of that report, research on the defect was published a week earlier than the manufacturers had planned, before some had time to work out a complete fix.  The Graz team had already been working on a tool to defend against attempts to steal secrets from kernel memory.   In a paper presented last June they called it KAISER, or Kernel Address Isolation to have Side-channels Effectively Removed.  As the name suggests, KAISER seeks to defend the kernel memory from a so-called side-channel attack that exploits a design feature of modern processors that increases their speed.  This involves processors executing tasks \u201cout-of-order\u201d, and not in the sequence received. If the CPU makes the right speculative call, time is saved. Get it wrong and the out-of-order task is cancelled and no time is lost.  Researcher Anders Fogh wrote in a subsequent blog that it might be possible to abuse so-called speculative execution in order to read kernel memory. He was not able to do so in practice, however. (bit.ly/2vpkut0)  Only after the December self-hacking episode did the significance of Graz team\u2019s earlier work become clear. It turned out that the KAISER tool presented an effective defence against Meltdown.  The team quickly got in touch with Intel and learned that other researchers - inspired in part by Fogh\u2019s blog - had made similar discoveries.  They were working under so-called responsible disclosure, where researchers inform affected companies of their findings to give them time to prepare \u2018patches\u2019 to repair flaws they have exposed.  The key players were independent researcher Paul Kocher and the team at a company called Cyberus Technology, said Gruss, while Jann Horn at Google Project Zero (GOOGL.O) came to similar conclusions independently.  \"We merged our efforts in mid-December with the team around Paul Kocher and the people from Cyberus Technology to work on two solid publications on Meltdown and Spectre,\" said Gruss. (www.meltdownattack.com)  Gruss had not even been aware of the work Horn was doing. (here)   \u201cJann Horn developed all of this independently - that\u2019s incredibly impressive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe developed very similar attacks, but we were a team of 10 researchers.\u201d  The wider team said patches for Meltdown, based on KAISER, had been readied for Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) operating systems, as well as for the Linux open-source system.  There is as yet no fix for Spectre, which tricks programmes into leaking their secrets but is viewed as a harder exploit for a hacker to carry out.  Asked which of the two flaws posed the greater challenge, Gruss said: \u201cThe immediate problem is Meltdown.  \u201cAfter that it is going to be Spectre. Spectre is more difficult to exploit but also to mitigate. So in the long run I\u2019d bet on Spectre.\u201d  (This story has been refiled to remove incorrect detail on name given to app in paragraph 13, amends detail about blog in paragraph 17.)

          "title": "Trump administration rule would let more Americans drop Obamacare",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday proposed a rule to allow Americans who are self-employed or work for small businesses to buy health insurance that does not comply with all Obamacare requirements in an effort to unwind the 2010 healthcare law.  The rule, put forward by the Department of Labor, would allow individuals and small businesses to form an association based on geography or industry and purchase health insurance that would be exempt from some rules of the Affordable Care Act.   The rule also allows sole proprietors to join such associations. Currently, sole proprietors can purchase individual insurance through the Obamacare individual market, created under former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law.  The rule must go through a comment period but is likely to gain approval, helping to enact an executive order Republican President Donald Trump signed in October.   Under Obamacare, all health insurance plans must cover a set of 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity and newborn care, addiction and mental health treatment and prescription drugs. The proposed rule would allow small business associations to purchase health plans that do not necessarily cover all of these benefits, which proponents say would help lower premiums.  The rule does not allow Small Business Health Plans to charge those with pre-existing conditions more or exclude employees because of their health.   Proponents of Obamacare say the rule would undermine the individual insurance market created under the law by allowing young and healthy people to purchase cheaper insurance, leaving the sickest and most expensive patients in the Obamacare markets, driving up costs. Hospitals, insurers and medical groups criticized the rule in December and said it would make health insurance unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.  The rule could destabilize several states\u2019 individual insurance markets because healthier people could access cheaper insurance, said Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel, adding that it is still unclear whether significant numbers of people will opt for the slimmer plans.  Republicans, who have unified control of government, have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, a top 2016 presidential campaign promise of Trump. Instead, the administration has sought to dismantle the law through administrative rules and executive orders.   Republicans dealt their biggest blow to the healthcare program in their tax overhaul, which Trump signed into law last month. The law in 2019 repeals the individual mandate, the requirement that most Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine. Health policy experts say the mandate helps ensure a viable market.  Several business groups, including the National Restaurant Association and the National Retail Federation, on Thursday praised the proposed rule, saying it would enable millions of people to obtain more affordable health insurance.  But Democrats and medical advocacy groups blasted the rule, saying it put affordable health insurance further out of reach for many Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions.  \u201cThe Trump administration has declared open season for fraudsters selling junk insurance while those with pre-existing conditions will find healthcare further and further out of reach,\u201d Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said.

          "body": "(Reuters) - The global private equity industry raised a record $453 billion from investors in 2017, leaving it with more than $1 trillion to pour into companies and new business ventures, data from industry tracker Preqin showed on Thursday.  The figures underscore the extent to which large institutional investors, as well as family offices, are placing a growing portion of their money with leveraged buyout firms, venture capital groups and growth equity funds, which are promising returns that beat the wider stock market.  The money raised in 2017 surpassed the previous landmark of $414 billion set in 2007.   However, there were a quarter fewer new private equity funds launched last year than in 2016, with fundraising boosted by so-called mega buyout funds, defined by Preqin as having assets of at least $4.5 billion.   Chief amount these funds was Apollo Global Management LLC\u2019s (APO.N) $24.6 billion Investment Fund IX, the largest private equity fund ever launched.  The buoyant fundraising market has fostered fierce competition for deals to put investment capital to work, driving up acquisition prices that can erode potential returns.  \u201cEntry prices for assets remain very high, and with so much available capital competing for deals, this will only increase the challenge for fund managers looking to deploy capital in 2018,\u201d a Preqin analyst wrote.   Nevertheless, David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-executive chairman of Carlyle Group LP (CG.O), one of the largest private equity firms, has expressed confidence about the industry\u2019s ability to put new money to work.  \u201cFor the last 15 or 20 years, very often, before firms like ours were publicly traded even, people were worried about whether you could deploy this capital,\u201d Rubenstein said at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) conference last month. \u201cNow it turns out that the capital can be deployed.\u201d  His confidence stems from what he described as investors\u2019 willingness to accept returns in the mid-teens as opposed to at least 20 percent in the past.   Private equity firms are also showing an increasing appetite for taking non-controlling positions in companies, which expands the field of possible investments.  In addition, Rubenstein said firms are making more investments outside of the United States, while putting a greater focus on improving the operational performance of portfolio companies, which should increase their re-sale value.

          "body": "(Updates with comments from Nutrien, Saskatchewan government)  By Rod Nickel  WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Nutrien Ltd, the fertilizer company formed this week by a merger of Potash Corp of Saskatchewan and Agrium, has committed to establishing its head office in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan and increasing corporate office jobs there, Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall said on Thursday.  Wall said that in recent meetings, Nutrien\u2019s leading executives agreed to increase corporate office positions in Saskatchewan by 15 percent, to 300.  Saskatchewan is home to all of Nutrien\u2019s operating potash mines, and the provincial government sets royalties and taxes on production. The location of top executives has long been politically sensitive as many were once based in Chicago.  Nutrien is the biggest global fertilizer producer by capacity, and has the largest U.S. network of farm retail stores.  Nutrien committed that its chief executive \u201cand/or\u201d its executive chair and president of potash operations will live in Saskatchewan, Wall said in a statement.  That promise is already satisfied, as Nutrien CEO Chuck Magro lives in Calgary, Alberta, where Agrium was based, while Executive Chairman Jochen Tilk lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.  Magro will continue to live in Calgary, but also plans to buy a home in Saskatoon, Nutrien spokesman Richard Downey said.  A spokeswoman for Wall, Karen Hill, said Saskatchewan did not make any new commitments to Nutrien in return. Wall will resign as premier in about a month, after his Saskatchewan Party picks a new leader on Jan. 27.  Nutrien shares dipped slightly in Toronto, but rose modestly in New York.

          "body": "* MiFID day trading suggests shift onto transparent venues  * Dark pool caps still to come into force  * Market Share Reporter data snapshot: tmsnrt.rs/2CQ04LR  By Helen Reid  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - More equity was traded on \u201clit\u201d order books during Wednesday\u2019s first day of sweeping new European market regulations, one possible sign that regulators may succeed in coaxing investors out of opaque \u201cdark pool\u201d trading and back onto exchanges.  On January 3, branded \u201cMiFID II day\u201d by market watchers, stock trading proceeded smoothly despite the regulatory changes.  But important shifts still to come into force, including a cap on dark pool trading in certain stocks, may cause changes to the overall market structure in the next months.  Dark pool trading essentially takes place on private exchanges not open to the general investor.  The amount of trading on lit order books - loosely defined as venues where trading prices and participants are publicly recorded - rose from 28.4 billion euros on Jan 2 to 36.4 billion euros on MiFID day, according to Thomson Reuters Market Share Reporter data.  Some 43 percent of trading occurred on lit exchanges, a level in line with the past month.  The total amount traded was 87 billion euros  ($105 billion), up from 75 billion on Jan 2, as traders trickled back to their desks after the festive period.  \u201cIt\u2019s quiet overall as people are still treading carefully regarding the new regulations,\u201d a trader said, adding that the dark pool caps would be the next catalyst.  Rob Boardman, CEO of trading platform ITG, said the real impact would be seen in the next few months.  \u201c(The first day was) just about making sure that the systems are working and implementing all the toys you have built to work in a compliant way,\u201d he said.  \u201cIn the next few months I am hoping that we will move on to a bit more of a creative phase.\u201d  The most impactful change still to come is a cap imposed by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on some stocks traded in dark pools, which is designed to push trades back onto lit markets.  The so-called \u201cdouble volume\u201d cap will require dark pools to suspend trading in stocks for which, on average, more than 8 percent of daily shares traded were transacted in the dark over the past 12 months.  ESMA will publish the list of stocks for suspension on Jan 9 and this would apply from Jan 12, an ESMA spokesman said.  By ITG\u2019s analysis, between 70 and 80 percent of the FTSE 100 stocks will be capped, and nearly as much of the FTSE 250.  In European equities, Boardman said it would not surprise him if half the stocks in the Eurostoxx 50 index were capped.  \u201cI don\u2019t think [the cap] will impact share prices, but it could impact liquidity,\u201d he said. \u201cSome traders might have fewer tools at their disposal for those who want to hide their trading intentions.\u201d ($1 = 0.8289 euros)  Reporting by Helen Reid, Editing by Jeremy Gaunt."

          "body": "KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber in the Afghan capital caused dozens of casualties on Thursday after blowing himself up close to a group of security personnel who were carrying out an operation against illegal drugs and alcohol dealing, officials said.  Islamic State, which has claimed a series of attacks in Kabul over the past two years, issued a statement on its Amaq news agency saying it was responsible.  It said a suicide bomber targeting a group of police and intelligence service personnel had detonated an explosive vest, killing or wounding around 80 of them.  Wahid Majroh, a spokesman for the ministry of public health, said 11 dead and 25 wounded had been brought to city hospitals after the blast in an area of the city not far from the U.S. Embassy and other foreign missions.  As security forces arrived, a Reuters reporter saw four police vehicles carrying dead or wounded security personnel from the scene.  Police officers at the scene said the bomber had been wearing police or army uniform and had approached a group of security personnel conducting controls on illegal drugs and alcohol sellers, but there was no official confirmation.  \u201cKabul police forces were there to prevent a possible protest when a suicide bomber approached them and detonated his suicide vest,\u201d Kabul police spokesman Bashir Mujahid said.  While Afghan forces backed by U.S. air strikes have claimed some success against Taliban insurgents since the United States announced a stepped up military strategy last year, high profile attacks on civilian targets in Kabul have continued.  The attack happened days after a suicide bomber killed at least 41 people and wounded more than 80 at a Shi\u2019ite cultural center in Kabul, underlining the precarious security situation in the Afghan capital.  That attack was also claimed by Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for a number of similar attacks in Afghanistan over the past two years.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor renowned for his preternatural optimism for America and its citizens\u2019 well-being, on Thursday encouraged those worried about the economic prospects for themselves and their children to shed their fears.  In an essay for the Jan. 15 issue of Time magazine, the chairman of the insurance and investment company Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) tried to allay concerns that innovation and improved productivity might cost jobs and disrupt lives.  Saying the U.S. \u201cgame of economic miracles\u201d was in its \u201cearly innings,\u201d Buffett, 87, downplayed polls suggesting broad pessimism for the futures of American children, saying rapid economic growth would not be necessary for people to thrive.  He said that if the economy grew at just 2 percent annually after adjusting for inflation, roughly its pace since the 2008 financial crisis, while population increased 0.8 percent a year,  then gross domestic product per capita would increase to $79,000 by 2043 from $59,000 now.  \u201cThis $20,000 increase guarantees a far better life for our children,\u201d Buffett wrote.  The essay is part of an issue titled \u201cThe Optimists\u201d edited by Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder and philanthropist.  Gates, also a Berkshire director and a longtime friend of Buffett, is Time\u2019s first guest editor in the magazine\u2019s 94-year history.  Buffett maintained that most American children will live \u201cfar better\u201d than their parents did, but urged the country to focus on closing the gap between the rich and less-rich.  While the wealth of the 400 richest Americans rose to $2.7 trillion last year from $93 billion in 1982, as computed by Forbes magazine Buffett said millions of people were left behind, \u201cstuck on an economic treadmill.\u201d  He said this can be fixed.  \u201cA rich family takes care of all its children, not just those with talents valued by the marketplace,\u201d Buffett wrote.  \u201cIn the years of growth that certainly lie ahead, I have no doubt that America can both deliver riches to many and a decent life to all. We must not settle for less.\u201d  Buffett ranked third on Forbes\u2019 list on Thursday with an $85.8 billion fortune, trailing only Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Jeff Bezos and Gates.  He might have ranked higher had he not donated roughly $27.6 billion of Berkshire stock to charity since 2006, including $30 million to an unnamed charity on Wednesday.

Norway is Western Europe\u2019s largest producer and exporter of oil and gas and plans to keep pumping for decades despite its support for the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to end the fossil fuel era this century.  Norway\u2019s output from the Arctic remains small, but the region is believed to hold the greatest potential for new discoveries that could gradually replace production from rapidly maturing North Sea and Norwegian Sea fields.  The government\u2019s lawyers had argued that the case was a publicity stunt that would cost jobs if it was successful.  \u201cIf it was a stunt it would be the most expensive ever,\u201d Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway, told Reuters. He said the lawsuit had already cost Greenpeace almost 3 million crowns in legal fees.  Still, he said the case had spurred debate about the risks of Arctic drilling and expressed hopes that it could inspire other lawsuits around the world. About 100 national constitutions, including Norway\u2019s, include guarantees of a safe environment.  In its ruling, the court dismissed the environmentalists\u2019 arguments that Norway should be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas exported to other nations, rather than just from exploration and drilling off Norway.  The court also said the risks of Arctic drilling were limited.  During the hearing in late 2017, the government said it was inappropriate to invoke the constitution rather than focus on taxes and regulations to control greenhouse gases.  The Norwegian oil industry lobby group welcomed the ruling.  \u201cWe\u2019ve previously said that this is a matter of politics, and politics should be made in parliament, not in the court,\u201d said Tommy Hansen, a spokesman for the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association.  Among firms winning stakes in 10 licenses awarded in Norway\u2019s 23rd round of awards were Lukoil, ConocoPhillips, Lundin, Aker BP, OMV, Centrica, Idemitsu and others.

          "body": "* France and Spain to sell almost 13 bln euros of bonds  * Spain leads fall in most bonds yields  * Spanish yields set for biggest daily fall since Nov 7  * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates prices)  By Dhara Ranasinghe  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Spain\u2019s government bond yields were set for their biggest daily fall in almost two months on Thursday, after the country successfully navigated its first debt sale of the year.  Most euro zone bond yields turned lower after Spain sold 4.6 billion euros worth of medium and long-term debt, towards the top end of the targeted range.  France, also holding its first debt sale of the year, sold just over 8 billion euros of long-dated debt although that was at the bottom of a range targeted by the country\u2019s debt agency.  January is traditionally one of the busiest months of the year for debt issuance in the single-currency bloc and analysts said there had been some cheapening of bond prices ahead of the sales.  \u201cIf you look at the Spanish auction it did quite well,\u201d said Martin van Vliet, senior rates strategist at ING.  \u201cThe story I hear is that there is money to be allocated into the bond market at the start of the year, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.\u201d  Ireland raised 4 billion euros on Wednesday with a syndicated 10-year bond that covered around a quarter of its 2018 issuance target just three days into the year. It received over 14 billion euros worth of orders, lead bankers for the deal said.  Bond yields across the single currency bloc were flat to 6 bps lower on Thursday, having traded 1-2 basis points higher in early trade.  The periphery led the falls, with Spain\u2019s 10-year bond yield down 5 bps at 1.55 percent and set for its biggest one-day fall since early November.  That pushed the gap over German Bund yields briefly to around 109 bps, its tightest in almost a week.  The gains in Spain\u2019s bond markets spilled over to its peripheral peers, with Portugal\u2019s 10-year bond yield down 6 bps at 1.94 percent.  In Germany, the bloc\u2019s benchmark bond issuer, 10-year bond yields edged lower to 0.435 percent.  Analysts said trading volumes had been slightly lower on Wednesday as sweeping new financial rules, known as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, came into force.  But they added that the strong Irish sale had cheered investors, providing an incentive to push yields down.  Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting released late on Wednesday showed Fed policymakers see future rate rises guided by inflation and fiscal stimulus.  \u201cWe think the discussion at the Fed indicates little opposition to raising rates in March and to pressing ahead with balance sheet reduction thanks to easy financial conditions,\u201d analysts at Mizuho said in a note.

          "body": "* FTSE 100 up 0.3 pct  * Oil majors, miners rise  * Debenhams drop weighs on retailers  * British services rebound in December  * House prices weigh on real estate (Adds closing prices)  By Kit Rees and Julien Ponthus  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - A rise in oil majors helped pushed the UK\u2019s top share index to an all-time high on Thursday but below the level enjoyed by its  European peers, as retailers hurt after a Debenhams profit warning and house prices weighed on the real estate sector.  Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index closed up 0.3 percent at 7,696.50 after hitting a record of 7702.11 points after surveys showed Britain\u2019s dominant services sector rebounded strongly last month.  The data pushed sterling slightly higher, keeping pressure on earners of dollars.  A rally in cyclical sectors such as financials and energy added about 22 points to the index, with BP and Shell rising 1.1 percent and one percent respectively.  The UK\u2019s oil and gas index was up one percent at its highest level since May 2008.  The British oil majors mirrored a move higher in oil prices, which were spurred to their highest since mid-2015 on the back of tensions in producer Iran.  A supportive research note from Barclays also helped the energy sector, in which analysts said they expected European integrated oil and refining companies to be cash flow positive after dividends in the fourth quarter, thanks to a higher oil price.  Likewise positive metals prices also drove shares in British miners. Shares in Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Billiton rose between 0.3 percent to 1.4 percent.  The mood was less positive among retail stocks, however, as shares in small cap Debenhams closed down 17.7 percent after a profit warning following a difficult Christmas trading period.  This contrasted with Next\u2019s upbeat update on Christmas sales on Wednesday.  Shares in Debenhams posted their biggest one-day loss since March 2008, while blue chip Marks & Spencer was also down 3.6 percent at the bottom of the FTSE.  \u201cOngoing structural challenges, a soft consumer environment, rising costs and increasing capex demands make for a difficult outlook (for Debenhams),\u201d analysts at Liberum said in a note.  The real estate sector also suffered after data showed British house prices grew last year at their slowest since 2012 and fell in London for the first time in a full year since 2009.  British Land Company fell 3 percent and Hammerson 2.5 percent.  Reporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Janet Lawrence, William\nMaclean"

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Global debt levels soared to a record high of $233 trillion in the third quarter of 2017, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said on Thursday, though it noted that robust economic growth meant debt-to-GDP ratios were declining.  The Washington DC-based financial industry body said while total debt had risen by $16 trillion in the third quarter compared to end-2016, debt ratio to global gross domestic product (GDP) had fallen for the fourth quarter in a row as the world economy expanded.  It was referring to total debt incurred by the household, government, financial and non-financial corporate sectors.  However, China which has accounted for the lion\u2019s share of new debt in emerging markets, saw the pace of debt accumulation slow; debt rose by two percentage points last year to 294 percent of GDP, compared to an average annual increase of 17 percentage points in the 2012-2016 period.  The IIF warned however, of \u201cheavy emerging market redemptions\u201d noting that over $1.5 trillion of bonds and syndicated loans would be maturing through end-2018.

Roberto Borge, who governed the touristy state of Quintana Roo from 2010 to 2016, was taken under strict security from the offices of Panama\u2019s national police to an air force base, where he boarded a Mexican plane, local television footage showed.  Mexican prosecutors accuse Borge of using funds obtained illegally, embezzlement and abuse of public office. Borge has denied the allegations.  Borge was arrested in Panama City in June as he was preparing to board a flight to Paris. Panama\u2019s foreign ministry said last week that it would send Borge to Mexico.  For the PRI, the extradition is the latest reminder of corruption scandals as the party tries to rehabilitate its image ahead of a presidential election in July.  The PRI, which is trying to keep hold of power as President Enrique Pena Nieto\u2019s term ends, has faced a spate of graft allegations, and four of its former governors were arrested on such charges last year in various countries, including Borge.  Last month, Mexican authorities arrested Alejandro Gutierrez, a former high-ranking PRI official, in a corruption investigation in the northern state of Chihuahua.

Hirscher, who is aiming for a seventh successive World Cup title, extended his lead in the overall standings to 674 points, while he is also in the slalom\u2019s driving seat on 354 points.   Matt, the younger brother of Austria\u2019s former world champion and Olympic gold medalist Mario Matt, came close to snatching his second World Cup win after topping the opening leg 0.21 seconds ahead of second-placed Hirscher.  With the soft course on Mt Sljeme\u2019s artificial snow rapidly deteriorating throughout the second leg when the top 30 skiers started in reverse order, the front-runners showed their class amid a dramatic climax.  Kristoffersen, third after the opening leg, held on to stay in pole position ahead of Manuel Feller but could only watch helplessly as his great rival Hirscher did just enough to claim the lead by 0.11 seconds.  Matt appeared set to hand Hirscher a rare defeat after charging ahead by half a second at the intermediate point of the second leg, but holes in the lower section did the damage as he crossed the finish line 0.05 seconds behind Hirscher.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - A rally in European stocks picked up pace on Thursday, following the lead of Asian shares which hit a ten-year peak overnight, as services growth data for the euro zone confirmed a strengthening economy was bolstering corporate activity.  Gains spanning cyclical sectors including industrials .SXNP and banks .SX7P drove the pan-European STOXX 600  up 0.5 percent while euro zone stocks .STOXXE and blue-chips rose 0.8 percent.  Services PMI data showed the euro area was near its best growth in seven years, while services growth in Italy and Spain beat the previous flash estimates.  Banks Santander (SAN.MC), BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and ING (INGA.AS) were among the top boosts to the STOXX as increasing enthusiasm about the euro zone\u2019s recovery helped push money into financial stocks.  \u201cThe continued strength and breadth of the business surveys is encouraging,\u201d said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, adding the improvement in Italian PMIs was a positive heading into the election.  \u201cWe continue to believe that the outlook for European equities is positive, aided by the potential for close to ten percent earnings growth in 2018,\u201d Bell added.  The improving economic backdrop drove analysts to hold back on downward revisions for euro zone company earnings as they awaited the beginning of the fourth-quarter results season.  Better-than-expected U.S. car sales data and rising oil prices also drove auto and energy stocks higher.  Germany's DAX .GDAXI led the way with a 0.9 percent gain thanks to strong carmakers and industrials, while Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE hit a record high.  U.S. car sales data for December beat analysts\u2019 expectations, driving European automakers .SXAP up 1.5 percent, leading sector gainers.  Italian carmaker Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) rose 4 percent to hit a record high, among top STOXX gainers, while Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) led the DAX.  \u201cDefensive sectors, industrials, energy and IT could offer interesting opportunities,\u201d said Romain Boscher, co-head of equities at Amundi. On small- and mid-caps Boscher said he remained positive on cyclical themes.   Remy Cointreau (RCOP.PA) was a rare laggard, down 2.9 percent after Investec downgraded the stock, saying Chinese anti-corruption measures could affect consumption of costly status symbol products like cognac.

          "title": "Married heart patients more likely than singles to survive",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - People with heart disease have better long-term survival odds when they are married, a recent U.S. study suggests.   Compared to divorced, widowed and never-married peers, who were up to 71 percent more likely to die during a follow-up of several years, married patients also had fewer heart risk factors like high blood pressure and were more likely to be on heart medications.  \u201cWe measured biomarkers including cholesterol, high blood pressure and presence of diabetes. True, unmarried patients are dying more because they have these conditions. But just the marital status in and of itself is an independent risk factor,\u201d senior study author Dr. Arshed Quyyumi of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta told Reuters in a phone interview.   Quyyumi and his team looked at the relationship between marital status and incidence of cardiovascular death, heart attack and death from any cause in 6,051 men and women who had their clogged heart arteries cleared at Emory Healthcare hospitals between 2003 and 2015. Follow-up ranged from 1.7 to 6.7 years, averaging about three and a half years.   Overall, the unmarried patients were 1.45 times as likely as the married patients to experience a cardiovascular event leading to death, 1.52 times as likely to have a heart attack and 1.24 times as likely to die from any cause during the follow-up period, the researchers report in the Journal of the American Heart Association.  Widows fared the worst, with a 71 percent higher likelihood of heart attack or cardiovascular death compared to married patients. Divorced, separated and never-married patients had about 40 percent higher odds for those events.  Past research has found that being married is associated with better health and survival overall, the study team notes, although the mechanisms involved need further study.  \u201cIt\u2019s a culmination of factors,\u201d said Dr. Rahul Potluri of Aston Medical School in Birmingham, UK, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cBenefits of marriage include the impetus to look after one\u2019s health. There\u2019s an increased likelihood to seek and obtain healthcare for the detection of chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Keeping away from smoking due to a \u2018nagging partner\u2019 can also play a role,\u201d he said.   People with a spouse tend to have a greater purpose in life and are more likely to take responsibility for their health through diet, exercise and medication adherence, Quyyumi noted. But when a significant other is no longer in the picture, compliance starts to slip.    Other possible explanations for the apparent protective effects of marriage include a lack of social support combined with acute stresses that come with divorce, extended bereavement followed by the loss of a loved one and the reduced interaction that comes with living alone, he said.   A lack of social support has been thought to worsen outcomes in cardiac patients after divorce, Quyyumi said, suggesting that the emotional and financial stress of divorce may play a role in adverse outcomes.  \u201cBut it\u2019s important to remember that divorce comes in different shades,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag. For some it is stressful, but for many it can be a relief. Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated that remarriage may attenuate the increased risk of a cardiac event often observed after divorce.\u201d   In the widowed group, it may have to do with psychological and behavioral events that accompany life\u2019s course.   \u201cSome people give up after the loss of a spouse. Bereavement shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly and people who find themselves sick and alone must be aware that they are at a greater risk of a secondary cardiovascular occurrence, or worse, death,\u201d Quyyumi said.  \u201cWe obviously cannot prescribe marriage to patients,\u201d Potluri said. \u201cBut we can emphasize the role of relationships and friendships in managing coronary artery disease.\u201d  \u201cTry to regain a sense of purpose,\u201d Quyyumi said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s finding another partner to compensate for the social support one has lost, becoming more involved in your children\u2019s family or finding a church group. These things all help a patient to once again become more interested in saving their own life.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2CF8k3s Journal of the American Heart Association, online December 20, 2017."

          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Trump administration proposed a rule on Thursday to allow Americans who are self-employed or work for small businesses to buy health insurance that does not comply with all Obamacare requirements in an effort to unwind the 2010 healthcare law.  The rule, put forward by the Department of Labor, would allow individuals and small businesses to form an association based on geography or industry and purchase health insurance that would be exempt from some rules of the Affordable Care Act.  The rule also allows sole proprietors to join such associations. Currently, sole proprietors can purchase individual insurance through the Obamacare individual market, created under former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law.  The rule must go through a comment period but is likely to gain approval, helping to enact a similar executive order Trump signed in October.  Under Obamacare, all health insurance plans must cover a set of 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity and newborn care, addiction and mental health treatment and prescription drugs. The proposed rule would allow small business associations to purchase health plans that do not necessarily cover all of these benefits, which proponents say would help lower premiums.  The rule does not allow Small Business Health Plans to charge those with pre-existing conditions more or exclude employees because of their health.  Proponents of Obamacare say the rule would undermine the individual insurance market created under the law by allowing young and healthy people to purchase cheaper insurance, leaving the sickest and most expensive patients in the Obamacare markets, driving up costs. Hospitals, insurers and medical groups criticized the rule in December and said it would make health insurance unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.  Republicans, who have unified control of government, have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, a top 2016 presidential campaign promise of U.S. President Donald Trump. Instead, the administration has sought to dismantle the law through administrative rules and executive orders.  Republicans dealt their biggest blow to the healthcare program in their tax overhaul that Trump signed into law last month. The law in 2019 repeals the individual mandate, the requirement that most Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine. Health policy experts say the mandate helps ensure a viable market.  Several business groups, including the National Restaurant Association and the National Retail Federation, on Thursday praised the proposed rule, saying it would enable millions of people to obtain more affordable health insurance.

Hirscher, who is aiming for a seventh successive World Cup title, extended his lead in the overall standings to 674 points, while he is also in the slalom\u2019s driving seat on 354 points.   Matt, the younger brother of Austria\u2019s former world champion and Olympic gold medalist Mario Matt, came close to snatching his second World Cup win after topping the opening leg 0.21 seconds ahead of second-placed Hirscher.  With the soft course on Mt Sljeme\u2019s artificial snow rapidly deteriorating throughout the second leg when the top 30 skiers started in reverse order, the front-runners showed their class amid a dramatic climax.  Kristoffersen, third after the opening leg, held on to stay in pole position ahead of Manuel Feller but could only watch helplessly as his great rival Hirscher did just enough to claim the lead by 0.11 seconds.  Matt appeared set to hand Hirscher a rare defeat after charging ahead by half a second at the intermediate point of the second leg, but holes in the lower section did the damage as he crossed the finish line 0.05 seconds behind Hirscher.

          "body": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Under pressure from allies in the West, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is staking his career on reining in the Shi\u2019ite militias that helped him defeat Islamic State.   The task will not be easy. The paramilitaries, or Popular Mobilisation Forces, are mostly trained and backed by Iran, so Abadi risks angering his most powerful regional backer.  Iraq\u2019s Shi\u2019ite majority also see the PMF\u2019s 150,000 fighters as their saviors. Several militia commanders plan to run against Abadi in parliamentary elections in May and some have warned they will resist attempts to dismantle them.  Abadi\u2019s plan envisages taking back the militias\u2019 heavy weapons and cutting their strength by half, according to military and intelligence sources.  The army is already taking an inventory of PMF weaponry, such as the armored vehicles and tanks the government gave them to fight Islamic State.  Next, Abadi will order his military and police commanders to take back those heavy weapons under the pretext of repairing them. The defense ministry will then remove over-age or physically unfit fighters, two military sources said.  \u201cThe plan will be implemented with extreme caution and precision in order to prevent a negative backlash from the PMF commanders,\u201d said an army colonel who was briefed on it by his commander. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep a second army within one state; this is the key objective of the plan.\u201d  The plan will be closely followed by Iran and the United States. The groups are one of Iran\u2019s many levers of influence in Iraq, while for Washington they are a reminder of Tehran\u2019s growing reach in the Middle East.  Lawmakers close to Abadi and one of his political advisers say he is coming under \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d from the West and Sunni regional allies to dissolve the PMF now that Islamic State, or Daesh, is no longer a major threat.  \u201cPrime Minister Abadi is getting messages from allies in the war against Daesh encouraging him to dismantle the PMF as a condition to keeping their support flowing in future,\u201d the adviser said on condition of anonymity.   In a phone call last month, French President Emmanuel Macron encouraged Abadi to dismantle the PMF, said the adviser, who was briefed on the call.  With Islamic State crushed in Iraq, Abadi will find it harder to avoid clamping down on the militia, according to a lawmaker from his Dawa Party.  \u201cAbadi would respond to pressure from his Western and Gulf allies to dissolve the PMF by saying he needs them to fight Daesh, but now Daesh is finished and there are no more excuses to keep the PMF,\u201d the lawmaker said.  In any case Abadi does not trust the Iranians, whose  militia allies act like a state within a state, said a Shi\u2019ite lawmaker close to the prime minister.  \u201cAbadi sees the support of the West, the United States and regional Arab states as indispensable in making Iraq more stable in future,\u201d the lawmaker said.  But militia commanders, such as Ali al-Hussaini from the Imam Ali Brigades, say the PMF played a major part in defeating Islamic State and dismantling them would be a \u201cbig mistake\u201d.  \u201cWe have millions of followers who will defend our rights against any attempt to target us,\u201d he said.  Nonetheless, a joint committee from the army, police, and intelligence services will review the number of PMF fighters and make recommendations to Abadi, who will decide who will stay and who will be retired, said a military intelligence colonel who is close to the military chief of staff\u2019s office.  Abadi would also order his commanders to restructure their own forces.  Another army colonel said taking heavy weapons from the militias would not be easy, as they control hundreds of headquarters, arms stockpiles, camps, and even small rocket factories.  Disarming the militias is one of Abadi\u2019s most delicate challenges. They are generally more effective than the Iraqi security forces and often defy Baghdad with the support of Tehran.  They also have the blessing of Iraq\u2019s most influential Shi\u2019ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.  Iraqi Shi\u2019ite militia commanders are openly loyal to Tehran, Iranian advisers are seen on Iraqi battlefields, and Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Abadi in June against weakening the militias.  The PMF gained prominence after Sistani called on Iraqis to take up arms against Islamic State when it seized a third of the country in 2014.  Since then the militias have become more assertive, riding around cities in vehicles flying their own flags. They are accused of terrorizing minority Sunnis, which they deny.  Security sources and analysts say any attempt by Abadi to muzzle the PMF could invite a backlash from Shi\u2019ites, who expect the militias to protect them in the event of renewed sectarian conflict in Iraq.  Any backlash could lead to the election of an alliance of Iranian-backed political parties to enough seats in parliament to end Abadi\u2019s bid for a second term.  Abadi\u2019s success against Islamic State and in quashing a Kurdish bid for independence in Iraq may tempt him into over-confidence in acting against the militias, said Jasim al-Bahadli, a Baghdad-based expert on Shi\u2019ite armed groups.  \u201cPlaying hard with the PMF could be a double-edged sword; they have broad popularity that Abadi should not underestimate.\u201d   To counter the PMF\u2019s popularity, Abadi has turned to the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who once led an armed rebellion against U.S. occupation forces and was named the most dangerous man in Iraq by the Pentagon.  The pair held a secret meeting in the holy Shi\u2019ite city of Karbala on Nov. 11 to discuss Sadr helping the government disarm the militias, according to aides for both men who attended the meeting.  Sadr sees the militias as a threat to his role as a kingmaker in Iraq\u2019s turbulent politics.  During their meeting, Abadi asked Sadr to support him in his bid to \u201ccleanse the country\u201d of corrupt politicians and those who might try to use armed groups to influence the election, an adviser to Sadr said.  \u201cThey talked about putting an end to the militias operating above the law, fighting corruption, and of course supporting Abadi\u2019s bid to be prime minister for a second\u00a0term,\u201d he said.  Several lawmakers close to Abadi and sources close to Sadr said the prime minister had secured the cleric\u2019s support to stop the PMF interfering in the election.  \u201cSadr can put hundreds of thousands on the streets in solidarity with Abadi with one call, he would make Abadi\u2019s opponents think twice before challenging him,\u201d said a senior Shi\u2019ite politician close to Sadr.  Indeed, Sadr plans to do just that in the very near future, another source close to him said.  Sources close to Sadr said he also promised to persuade Sistani to support Abadi\u2019s plans to restrain the militias.   That could give Abadi an edge over the militias, which comprise more than 66 groups, over 40 of which are backed by Iran, according to security sources and analysts.  It would also put Abadi in a strong position against one of his main challengers, Hadi al-Amiri, who commands Iraq\u2019s\u00a0largest Iranian-backed Shi\u2019ite militia, the Badr Organisation.  \u201cBadr will lead the PMF list in next election under the leadership of Hadi al-Amiri,\u201d said Ameer al-Kinani, a Sadrist adviser to Iraqi President Fuad Masum. \u201cThis is known to all.\u201d  Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed; Writing by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Michael Georgy and Giles Elgood"

          "body": "* Upbeat growth data pushes world stocks higher  * Euro near three-year high  * Oil hits highest since mid 2015 (Updates to U.S. trading open; changes byline, dateline, previously LONDON)  By Stephanie Kelly  NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Strong data from the world\u2019s largest economies helped global shares climb to new heights on Thursday, while the euro hovered near a three-year high and the U.S. dollar fell against major currencies.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe broke a new record, with an advance of 0.79 percent.  On Thursday, the ADP National Employment Report showed that U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, marking the biggest monthly increase since March.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 153.65 points, or 0.62 percent, to 25,076.33, sailing past the 25,000-mark for the first time. The S&P 500 gained 11.48 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,724.54 and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.99 points, or 0.14 percent, to 7,075.53, with both indexes hitting fresh highs.  Separately, China\u2019s services sector activity hit its highest level in more than three years, manufacturing data from Japan came in strong, and euro zone surveys showed the bloc enjoying its strongest run in nearly seven years.  London\u2019s FTSE set a record on Thursday and was up 0.28 percent, while Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei - Asia\u2019s biggest market - had earlier shot to its highest since 1992 and was up 3.26 percent.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed up 0.51 percent, scaling a decade-high peak as a fifth day of gains in China helped emerging market stocks to a six-and-a-half year high.  Those gains come after Wednesday\u2019s release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s mid-December meeting that did little to change a view that it will stick to measured increases in U.S. interest rates.  The minutes showed policymakers expect U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul will boost consumer spending but are still uncertain about the wider impact the stimulus would have on factors such as inflation.  The euro resumed a rally that has taken it near its highest levels in three years, while the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, failed to hold its previous session\u2019s gains after upbeat U.S. data and minutes from the Federal Reserve.  The euro rose 0.45 percent to $1.2066, while the dollar index was down 0.27 percent.  The stronger-than-expected U.S. private-sector jobs report briefly helped the dollar pare losses versus the euro and extend gains against the yen. But those moves were shortlived.  \u201cThe market quickly faded, the mini-rally in the dollar as the trend gave way to what we have been seeing for the past several weeks, which is dollar weakness,\u201d said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.31 percent versus the greenback at 112.87 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3545, up 0.23 percent on the day.  U.S. Treasury yields rose, with two-year yields hitting a more than nine-year peak as upbeat December private hiring data boosted expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates at its March policy meetings.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.4743 percent, from 2.445 percent late on Wednesday.  The 30-year bond last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.8042 percent, from 2.783 percent late on Wednesday.  Oil rose above $68 a barrel to its highest since May 2015 after unrest in Iran sparked concerns about supply risks and with support coming from OPEC-led output cuts and demand-boosting cold weather in the United States.  U.S. crude rose 0.71 percent to $62.07 per barrel and Brent was last at $68.01, up 0.25 percent on the day.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L)(UNc.AS) plans to close its Colman\u2019s mustard factory in the English city of Norwich next year, after more than 160 years, affecting 113 jobs.  Production of the condiment will likely start to be transferred this year to other British sites including Burton upon Trent, where Marmite and Bovril are made, with some packing moving to Germany, the company said on Thursday.  The decision follows a review launched in October when UK soft drink maker Britvic (BVIC.L) announced the closure of its Norwich factory, on a site co-owned with Unilever.  Britvic\u2019s decision had \u201cserious implications\u201d for Unilever, a company spokeswoman said in a statement.  About 40 of the jobs will transfer to Burton, while 25 will be created in Norwich by a new facility for production and packing of Colman\u2019s mustard powder, mustard milling and mint processing, Unilever said. The company will also continue to source its mint and mustard locally, it said.   The move comes as British businesses prepare for the country\u2019s exit from the European Union, and as Unilever also reviews its dual-headed Anglo-Dutch structure.   \u201cThe government is disappointed Unilever has decided to close its Norwich plant, though we welcome Unilever\u2019s commitment to mustard milling and mint production in Norwich,\u201d a spokesman for the British government said, adding that it will work closely with the company, local government officials and unions throughout the consultation period.  Jeremiah Colman began selling mustard near Norwich in 1814. His great-nephew Jeremiah James Colman established the factory there in 1858. Unilever acquired the business in 1995 from what is now Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L).   Reporting by Martinne Geller, editing by David Evans and Adrian Croft"

A 14-month investigation by the Administrative Control Authority, the country\u2019s anti-corruption body, found that the group was made of government officials, Egyptian citizens, and foreigners, state news agency MENA said.  Authorities arrested the defendants in raids across the country, from the capital Cairo to the northern city of Kafr el-Sheikh.   The probe showed that they were involved in \u201cbribery, profiting from public office, forging official documents, and human trafficking\u201d among a host of other offences.  Egypt passed legislation in 2016 to crack down on a growing smuggling industry along its northern seaboard. The law imposes prison terms and fines on those found guilty of smuggling potential migrants or acting as brokers or middlemen.   It also imposes prison sentences on those who provide shelter to trafficked migrants, and gather, transport or otherwise facilitate their journey.

          "body": "OSLO (Reuters) - Last year was the second hottest worldwide on record, just behind a sweltering 2016, with signs of climate change ranging from wildfires to a thaw of Arctic ice, a European Union monitoring center said on Thursday.  The Copernicus Climate Change Service, the first major international weather agency to report on conditions in 2017, said temperatures averaged 14.7 degrees Celsius (58.46 Fahrenheit) at the Earth\u2019s surface - 1.2C (2.2F) above pre-industrial times.  Last year was slightly \u201ccooler than the warmest year on record, 2016, and warmer than the previous second warmest year, 2015\u201d, it said. Temperature records date back to the late 19th century.  \u201cIt\u2019s striking that 16 of the 17 warmest years have all been this century,\u201d Jean-Noel Thepaut, head of Copernicus, told Reuters, adding there was overwhelming scientific consensus that man-made emissions were stoking the warming trend.  The Copernicus study is in line with a projection by the U.N. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in November that 2017 would be second or third warmest behind 2016.  In 2016, an extra dose of heat came from El Nino, a natural event that releases heat from the Pacific Ocean every few years.  But last year was the hottest year without an El Nino, according to Copernicus, run by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.  It pointed to a retreat of sea ice in the Arctic and prolonged dry conditions in southern Europe that helped trigger wildfires in Portugal and Spain in 2017 as examples of the sort of disruptions that are becoming more frequent in a warming climate.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts that climate change has a human cause, tweeted on Dec. 29 about bone-chilling cold in the United States and cast doubt on the need for action to limit emissions.  \u201cPerhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!\u201d he wrote.  Trump plans to quit the 2015 Paris Agreement, which has the backing of almost 200 nations and seeks to limit the rise in temperatures to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) above pre-industrial times, ideally 1.5 C (2.7 F).  High winds and heavy show barreled into the U.S. northeast on Thursday, closing schools and government offices and disrupting travel. [L1N1OZ0C5]   Data on Thursday compiled by the University of Maine and the Climate Change Institute showed temperatures in the eastern United States, Greenland and parts of central Asia were indeed colder than usual, while most of the rest of the world was warmer.      Earlier on Thursday, German reinsurer Munich Re said insurers would have to pay claims of around $135 billion for 2017, the most ever, following a spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America.  Thepaut said rising sea levels and higher temperatures that can produce more rainfall may have aggravated Atlantic hurricanes, even though it was hard to detect links between individual storms and man-made climate change.  The WMO will publish its review of 2017 temperatures, also drawing on Copernicus and other U.S., British and Japanese data, in about two weeks.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The damage from a deadly Amtrak train crash in Washington state in December topped $40.4 million, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said in a preliminary report on Thursday.   The safety board also said the crash that killed three and injured 70 could have been prevented if a safety technology system known as positive train control had been operational.  The board previously said Amtrak 501 was traveling at 78 miles per hour (126 km per hour) when it derailed, far above the 30 mph speed limit. The NTSB also said it has not been able to interview either operating crewmember due to their injuries from the accident.  The NTSB reported last month that six seconds before the derailment off a bridge and onto a highway, the engineer remarked that the train was speeding. The engineer then applied the brakes but apparently not the emergency brake, NTSB said.  U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, in letters released on Tuesday, urged the nation\u2019s railroads and transit agencies to \u201ctake all possible measures\u201d to meet congressional deadlines to install positive train control to prevent crashes.  Chao said she wanted railroads to \u201cgreatly accelerate\u201d efforts to meet congressional deadlines.  Positive train control (PTC) is designed to prevent derailments caused by excessive speed. The NTSB has said several deadly U.S. train crashes in recent years could have been prevented if the system was in place and has for years urged its universal adoption.  In 2008, Congress mandated the implementation of PTC nationwide by the end of 2015, then extended that deadline until the end of 2018 when its installation became more complex than anticipated. The government can extend the deadline to 2020 to complete some aspects of the system.  Amtrak said last month it was \u201cimperative that the rail industry urgently work together to get PTC activated on the national network as soon as possible - and certainly by the December 2018 federal deadline, if not before.\u201d  Washington state officials have said PTC was installed and being tested but was not yet been operational on the line where the derailment occurred.

The device, FreeStyle Libre Flash, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September. It allows diabetes patients to continuously track blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers.  Abbott\u2019s device is the second continuous glucose monitoring system after DexCom Inc\u2019s G5 Mobile to be covered by the federal agency.  DexCom\u2019s device is similar to Abbott\u2019s, but requires fingertip testing about two to four times a day for optimal accuracy.  Abbott\u2019s device has a retail price of $70 for a reader and $36 per sensor, which lasts for 10 days.   \u201c(This) cost is much less than other CGM systems that are available commercially,\u201d said Jared Watkin, senior vice president of Abbott\u2019s Diabetes Care unit.  Watkin added that the Medicare pricing would be different as it is based on certain reimbursement codes.  CMS rolled out deep cuts to reimbursement rates for certain laboratory and diagnostic tests under Medicare in November, a move that could save the government about $670 million in Medicare payments in 2018.  The reimbursement rates for the CGM system under the existing codes are $3,000 for a year, of which the federal agency pays $2,400 and the rest is paid out of pocket by the patients, Watkin said. \u201cThose codes can change,\u201d he added.

The 30-member blue-chip index crossed five 1,000-point marks in 2017, driven partly by President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda and solid corporate earnings.  The momentum carried into 2018, with the benchmark S&P index closing above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settling above 7,000 a day earlier.  \u201cEvery 1,000-point increment in the Dow is becoming less of a percent move. It\u2019s just another milestone,\u201d said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.  \u201cThe point that people need to take is that the macro indicators are telling investors that world economies are doing really well.\u201d  World stocks also hit records, driven by strong manufacturing and services sector data in major economies.  U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December and planned layoffs by American-based companies fell sharply, pointing to sustained labor market strength.  The ADP National Employment Report showed that U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, much above the 190,000 job additions forecast by economists polled by Reuters.  Investors\u2019 focus now shifts to the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday.  At 10:58 a.m. ET (1558 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 150.34 points, or 0.6 percent, at 25,073.02 and the S&P 500 was up 12.98 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,726.04. The Nasdaq Composite was up 22.58 points, or 0.32 percent, at 7,088.11.  Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by 1.4 percent gain in the financial index.  Wells Fargo and JPMorgan rose about 2 percent and Goldman Sachs 1.7 percent after the strong data raised the odds of a March rate hike.  Victoria\u2019s Secret-owner L Brands slid 15 percent on disappointing quarterly earnings forecast.  J.C. Penney and Macy\u2019s were down about 6 percent after reporting same-store sales for the key months of November and December.  Sprint fell about 5 percent after the wireless carrier appointed former Altice NV Chief Executive Michel Combes as chief financial officer.  Intel declined as much as 5 percent, adding to Wednesday\u2019s losses that was triggered by a report that its chips were vulnerable to being hacked.  Rival Advanced Micro Devices rose 6.5 percent.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,692 to 1,065. On the Nasdaq, 1,635 issues rose and 1,185 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor renowned for his preternatural optimism for America and its citizens\u2019 well-being, on Thursday encouraged those worried about the economic prospects for themselves and their children to shed their fears.  In an essay for the Jan. 15 issue of Time magazine, the chairman of the insurance and investment company Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) tried to allay concerns that innovation and improved productivity might cost jobs and disrupt lives.  Saying the U.S. \u201cgame of economic miracles\u201d was in its \u201cearly innings,\u201d Buffett, 87, downplayed polls suggesting broad pessimism for the futures of American children, saying rapid economic growth would not be necessary for people to thrive.  He said that if the economy grew at just 2 percent annually after adjusting for inflation, roughly its pace since the 2008 financial crisis, while population increased 0.8 percent a year,  then gross domestic product per capita would increase to $79,000 by 2043 from $59,000 now.  \u201cThis $20,000 increase guarantees a far better life for our children,\u201d Buffett wrote.  The essay is part of an issue titled \u201cThe Optimists\u201d edited by Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder and philanthropist.  Gates, also a Berkshire director and a longtime friend of Buffett, is Time\u2019s first guest editor in the magazine\u2019s 94-year history.  Buffett maintained that most American children will live \u201cfar better\u201d than their parents did, but urged the country to focus on closing the gap between the rich and less-rich.  While the wealth of the 400 richest Americans rose to $2.7 trillion last year from $93 billion in 1982, as computed by Forbes magazine Buffett said millions of people were left behind, \u201cstuck on an economic treadmill.\u201d  He said this can be fixed.  \u201cA rich family takes care of all its children, not just those with talents valued by the marketplace,\u201d Buffett wrote.  \u201cIn the years of growth that certainly lie ahead, I have no doubt that America can both deliver riches to many and a decent life to all. We must not settle for less.\u201d  Buffett ranked third on Forbes\u2019 list on Thursday with an $85.8 billion fortune, trailing only Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Jeff Bezos and Gates.  He might have ranked higher had he not donated roughly $27.6 billion of Berkshire stock to charity since 2006, including $30 million to an unnamed charity on Wednesday.

          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. crude stocks fell last week as refiners boosted activity to the highest rate since 2005, while stocks of distillates, which include diesel and jet fuel, rose by the most in a year, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday.  Crude inventories fell by 7.4 million barrels in the week to Dec. 29, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for a decrease of 5.1 million barrels.  Refinery activity hit its highest utilization rate since 2005 as refiners kept processing heavy volumes of crude into products, and due in part to year-end tax concerns, analysts said. Crude runs rose by 210,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 1 percentage points to 96.7 percent.  \u201cRefineries have the incentive to run down stocks to avoid tax payments, which are based on the level of crude oil stocks at the year-end,\u201d said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, Germany.   U.S. crude futures were up 46 cents to $62.08 a barrel, while Brent crude gained 18 cents to $68.02 a barrel, as of 11:23 a.m. EST (1623 GMT).  Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 8.9 million barrels, versus expectations for a 477,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. This was the biggest one-week increase since the last week of 2016.  There have been concerns that the current cold weather would stress already low distillate inventories on the U.S. East Coast during this recent run of colder-than-usual weather, though this figure offsets that. Distillate stocks often rise sharply at the end of the year, with similar one-week jumps seen in 2016 and 2015.  Heating oil futures slumped after the report, but slowly recovered, and were down 0.5 percent to $2.0711 per gallon.  Gasoline stocks rose by 4.8 million barrels, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.2 million-barrel gain.  Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 292,000 barrels per day.  Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 2.4 million barrels, EIA said.

          "body": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - More than a dozen people were killed and hundreds were feared injured after a train struck a lorry, derailed and burst into flames in South Africa on Thursday.  Footage from television news showed fire engulfing one of the train\u2019s carriages after the accident, which occurred as it traveled between Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg.  Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi said the train, which was carrying 700 passengers, jumped the tracks after hitting the truck, which was attempting to negotiate a level crossing.  He said preliminary investigations suggested 12 people had died in the crash and 268 were injured, including four critically.  Emergency services said 14 people had died, and dozens were hurt, calling the minister\u2019s injury estimate premature.  \u201cI have been briefed that the accident was the result of a truck that was driving through a level crossing... You can see for yourself the truck driver was taking chances,\u201d Maswanganyi said on the news channel of national broadcaster SABC.  He said the driver had survived and police were investigating.  Emergency services and rail officials were not immediately able to confirm the circumstances of the crash.  South Africa has the continent\u2019s largest railway network, but it has been plagued by mismanagement and under-investment that has seen train use dwindle despite it being the cheapest from of public transportation.       In a recent report, the government\u2019s Rail Safety Regulator (RSR) said that, in the 2016/17 financial year, 495 people lost their lives in the country\u2019s railway environment and 2,079 were injured.  The death toll was up 5 percent increase from the previous year.  Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana; editing by John Stonestreet"

          "body": "OSLO/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S. court should dismiss the information provided by drilling rig firm Seadrill (SDRL.OL) about its restructuring plan as inadequate, a U.S. government bankruptcy watchdog said in a filing on Wednesday.   The U.S. Trustee said the bankruptcy court in Texas should reject Seadrill\u2019s so-called \u201cdisclosure statement\u201d on its restructuring proposal, a move that would require the Norwegian company to revise its statement and could delay the process.   The court, which has to approve the disclosure statement before the plan can be put to a vote by creditors, is due to hold a hearing on Jan. 10. It is not obliged to follow the Trustee\u2019s recommendations.    Seadrill, once the largest drilling rig operator by market value, filed for bankruptcy protection in a U.S. court on Sept. 12 after being hit hard by cutbacks in oil company investment following a steep drop in oil prices.  The company\u2019s main owner, Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen, has drawn up a $1.1 billion restructuring plan with Centerbridge Partners L.P. and a group of hedge funds.  However, Seadrill has also received two alternative proposals, one from Barclays Capital and another from a group of unsecured bondholders, and will have to convince the U.S. court and its creditors that its plan is better.  In an objection filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, acting U.S. Trustee Henry G. Hobbs, Jr. said Seadrill\u2019s disclosure statement lacked \u201cinformation and detail in critical areas which prevent creditors and interest holders from making an informed decision\u201d about the company\u2019s restructuring plan.  The Trustee, part of the U.S. Justice Department, said Seadrill\u2019s statement failed to disclose payments that benefited company insiders before it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.    The company disclosed $23 million in payments to unidentified company insiders as part of its statement of financial affairs (SOFA) on Nov. 11.  The Trustee said Seadrill had also wrongly included unsecured bank claims in the same class as other unsecured claims, echoing objections from some bondholders, including  shipbuilder Samsung Heavy Industries Co Ltd.  That could affect how the class as a whole votes on the restructuring plan, under which banks could recover at least 90 percent of their exposure, but bondholders as little as 18 percent.

German Richard Freitag, who was Stoch\u2019s main competitor for the title, ended his campaign early after a bad landing in the first round left him injured and unable to compete in the second round.

German Andreas Wellinger rounded out the podium after leaping 133 and 126 meters to notch 253.5 points.

AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier, did not disclose the 12 locations or how large the 5G coverage area would be in each market. The service will work only on 5G capable mobile devices.  \u201cAny implementation we do here will start off very controlled,\u201d Andre Fuetsch, president of AT&T Labs and chief technology officer, said in an interview. He said that AT&T will launch the mobile service using information it is already collecting in trials for a new 5G broadband service, where the last leg of Internet connection is delivered via a radio signal to a home or business using wireless spectrum known as millimeter wave.  The company has said it expects deployment of that service as early as late 2018. Verizon Communications Inc is launching a similar service in three to five markets in 2018.  Industry analysts consider 5G mobile service to be a bigger revenue opportunity for wireless carriers than broadband. T-Mobile US Inc has also said it is targeting nationwide 5G coverage by 2020.

          "body": "SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile recorded more than 8,000 tremors in 2017, according to scientists at the University of Chile, though none reached the magnitude of an earthquake.   The university\u2019s National Seismological Center said the number of tremors had reached 8,094 last year, a 26 percent increase over 2016. Of those, 352 were perceptible, while 7,742 were less than a magnitude of around 3, the center said in a statement.  Situated on the Pacific \u201cring of fire,\u201d Chile runs along a seismic zone where tectonic plates rub up against each other. It is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, and in 1960 was hit by a 9.5 magnitude quake, the strongest in recorded history.  National Seismological Center Director Sergio Barrientos attributed the spike to the country\u2019s increased capacity for detecting even the most subtle and remote of tremors.  \u201cChile is one of the most seismically active countries on the planet, and these statistics come as a result of our increasingly robust monitoring network,\u201d Barrientos said.  Chile is the world\u2019s top copper producer, and many of its largest copper mines are located in an area of northern Chile known to be especially quake-prone.   In recent years, the biggest earthquake to hit Chile was an 8.8 magnitude tremor that struck the central-southern region in 2010, triggering a tsunami and killing more than 500 people.  Practice drills are frequent in Chile, and builders follow strict construction codes, all of which tend to limit death and destruction when tremors hit.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Stocks are proving they can rally on U.S. markets\u00a0regardless of whether government bond yields rise or fall. But over the past 30 years, the two have never risen in tandem for more than four consecutive quarters. If that pattern holds, either\u00a0equities\u00a0or yields will slide within six months. It\u2019s more likely to be\u00a0equities.  The S&P 500 Index gained 1.5 percent in the first two trading days of this year at the same time as the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. government bond climbed four basis points, to\u00a0just under 2.5\u00a0percent. The phenomenon of the two rising together is neither new nor rare. It was the case in both the third and fourth quarters of 2017. And three decades of quarterly data show that U.S. stocks and bond yields rose simultaneously\u00a0a third of the time.      That\u2019s logical. Improving growth prospects strengthen the case for tighter U.S. monetary policy, which is typically associated with rising yields. But a cheerier economic outlook also bolsters companies\u2019 earnings, and therefore stock markets. However, history also shows that equities and yields only march higher in lockstep for a certain amount of time. The longest such run was four quarters, in 2013. The current streak may therefore have less than six months left.  There are several reasons why such trends eventually end. For example, if yields are going up because monetary policy tightening is anticipated, equity investors may at some point start worrying that the central bank\u2019s actions will slow economic activity. Also higher yields equate to rising borrowing costs for companies. And if relatively safe U.S. government bonds offer higher yields, there is less reason for investors to invest in riskier equities.  Of course, bond yields can sometimes fall when stocks are rising. But that looks unlikely when U.S. net issuance is due to outstrip central bank purchases by the most in six years. With U.S. stock markets already richly valued relative to the past decade, there\u2019s a greater chance that equity markets will stumble.

          "body": "* Graphic: sterling and gilt yields bit.ly/2dgAXn1  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv (Adds quote, updates prices)  By Saikat Chatterjee  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Sterling edged up on Thursday after surveys showed Britain\u2019s dominant services sector rebounded strongly last month, although investors remained reluctant to push the British currency much higher after its recent rally.  The pound also benefited from broad-based dollar weakness and a general rebound in risk appetite, which has lifted sentiment towards the British currency.  Persistent structural factors, such as a widening current account deficit, have kept investors wary, however.  \u201cLooking at positioning data, inflation and a big current account deficit, sterling looks to be more of a sell than a buy at these levels,\u201d said Hans Redeker, global head of currency strategy at Morgan Stanley based in London.  Sterling rose 0.3 higher at $1.3551 and remained within striking distance of a four-month high of $1.3659 hit in late September.  Long bets on sterling are hovering near their biggest levels in more than three years, according to the latest positioning data.  Some analysts said that the pound\u2019s failure to move any higher after the survey findings suggested the pound\u2019s recent strong showing may have been a little overdone.  \u201cThere could a pullback ahead given the fact that the recent gains were largely unsupported by any fundamental developments,\u201d said David Cheetham, market analyst at XTB.  Britain\u2019s dominant services sector grew unexpectedly quickly last month and businesses are more upbeat about 2018 than they were for much of 2017, but Brexit is weighing on investment plans, a survey showed on Thursday.  A near 3 percent rally in sterling since a landmark European Union summit last month that moved Brexit talks to the next stage has made some investors more optimistic on the currency\u2019s outlook in the coming weeks.  \u201cSterling held up well, and we have a window of \u2018Brexitless\u2019 trading until March and the resumption of talks while it also seems that support for a second referendum is starting to grow, especially in the parliamentary parties,\u201d said John Marley, head of FX strategy at Infinity International, a currency risk management firm.  The pound last year recorded its best annual performance against the dollar since 2009, with an almost 10 percent rise amid broad dollar weakness. But it is still around 10 percent down against the dollar since the vote for Brexit.  Against the euro, sterling is still more than 15 percent below its 2016 Brexit referendum day low.

          "title": "Breakingviews - Intel flaws hint at tech \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d risk",
          "body": "LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tech groups like Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet are attracting increasing political heat for their dominance of markets like e-commerce, social media and web search. But a recently discovered security flaw in chips made by Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and ARM highlights another important concern: bugs potentially affecting hardware found in the majority of computing devices.  Scale helps justify the massive investment needed to develop improved semiconductor technology and produce chips. Intel last year said it would spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory, and it had already started building the facility years ago. The dominance of a few players also helps ensure compatibility between machines. The downside is that hardware flaws like the newly revealed Meltdown and Spectre affect a huge number of users and could become systemic. It\u2019s an analogous problem to vulnerabilities in the once-dominant Microsoft Windows operating system \u2013 or, in the agricultural world, to a disease affecting a widely used crop variety, like the preponderant but under-threat Cavendish banana.  Security researchers on Wednesday published details of Meltdown and Spectre. The first affects Intel chips and potentially allows hackers to steal secret passwords by evading the hardware barrier between applications and a protected part of a computer\u2019s memory. The second also affects AMD and some ARM chips, and means hackers could trick applications into giving up information. Software groups like Apple and Microsoft had patches ready for Meltdown but not Spectre, which is less easily fixed but also harder to exploit.  Research outfit Gartner reckons no single semiconductor vendor has more than a 15 percent share across all processor types, with Samsung last year displacing Intel for the top spot because of booming memory-chip sales. But in specific sub-sectors \u2013 like personal-computer or data-centre chips \u2013 single vendors dominate. The $200 billion Intel has more than 90 percent of the market for central processing units used in servers, for example, while it and AMD have long dominated PC microprocessors.  True, vulnerabilities in chip design are rare. And the diligent patching of security holes helps mitigate the danger. But as semiconductors increasingly spread to homes, cars and factories through the Internet of Things, the risk is that a winner-takes-all chip industry effectively makes a few manufacturers\u2019 products too big to fail.

          "title": "LPC: Banks reap rewards from record U.S. syndicated lending",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank earnings from underwriting US syndicated loans leaped to an all-time high in 2017, propelled by an onslaught of deals locking in low interest rates as well as a late-year burst of announced mergers anticipating the biggest US tax system overhaul in more than 30 years.  The unprecedented push by highly indebted companies to refinance existing loans was the biggest driving force for the US$2.5trn of US syndicated loans issued last year. Total lending spiked 26% from the US$1.99trn in 2016 and 17% from the prior record of US$2.1trn reached in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC.  Fees earned on arranging loans to both low- and top-rated companies added to income from M&A advisory, and equity and bond underwriting fees to also set a record for the total US investment banking fee pool last year, jumping 20% to US$47.4bn, Freeman Consulting Services estimated based on Thomson Reuters data.  Banks earned nearly US$11bn in 2017 from underwriting leveraged loans, a 49% spike from the prior year, while income from lending to top-quality companies increased 21% to US$1.4bn, Freeman Consulting said.  Leveraged loan fees were the highest ever, topping the prior peak of US$9.3bn in 2014. Fees from underwriting investment-grade loans reached the second-highest on record, following US$1.8bn in 2011.  \u201cThere were really no macro shocks at all,\u201d Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting, said of the wide open lending markets. \u201cOil was stable, Europe and China were stable, and it was risk-on throughout all of 2017.\u201d  Even if leveraged loan refinancing fades from last year\u2019s torrid pace as interest rates rise, a steady pace of M&A is expected in 2018.  A corporate tax rate cut to 21% from 35% under the new US tax system, a steadily expanding economy, and the potential repeal or relaxation of US leveraged lending guidelines, will spur more company takeovers and leveraged buyouts, bankers and attorneys have said.  It remains to be seen if cheaper access to overseas cash stockpiles, part of US tax reform, will put a damper on lending to back these deals.  Prominent investment-grade loans included the US$49bn bridge loan late last year for US drugstore operator CVS Health Corp\u2019s US$69bn buy of health insurer Aetna Inc, the second-largest acquisition financing ever. Also noteworthy was the US$13.7bn bridge loan for Amazon.com\u2019s purchase of upscale grocer Whole Foods Market, a deal that is shaking up the food supply chain business and promising more tie-ups altering delivery models in various sectors.  Bank income generated from the growing crop of M&A deals announced in the fourth quarter will pick up in the first half of this year, when some large bridge loans are expected to be replaced with permanent bond financing.  \u201cRecently M&A has started to pick back up, and a lot of deals announced recently won\u2019t hit fee pools until next year,\u201d when the permanent financing closes, said Nassof.  CVS, for example, late in December entered into a US$5bn term loan agreement, reducing the size of the bridge, while leaving the vast majority of long-term debt financing and related lender fee income as this year\u2019s business.  The robust demand compelling fast-paced issuance of syndicated loans and high-yield bonds should persist at least into the first part of this year, assuring a steady fee source for banks, according to investors, bankers and attorneys.  \u201cThere\u2019s a massive amount of dry powder in the US,\u201d said one M&A attorney.

          "body": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Under pressure from allies in the West, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is staking his career on reining in the Shi\u2019ite militias that helped him defeat Islamic State.   The task will not be easy. The paramilitaries, or Popular Mobilisation Forces, are mostly trained and backed by Iran, so Abadi risks angering his most powerful regional backer.  Iraq\u2019s Shi\u2019ite majority also see the PMF\u2019s 150,000 fighters as their saviors. Several militia commanders plan to run against Abadi in parliamentary elections in May and some have warned they will resist attempts to dismantle them.  Abadi\u2019s plan envisages taking back the militias\u2019 heavy weapons and cutting their strength by half, according to military and intelligence sources.  The army is already taking an inventory of PMF weaponry, such as the armored vehicles and tanks the government gave them to fight Islamic State.  Next, Abadi will order his military and police commanders to take back those heavy weapons under the pretext of repairing them. The defense ministry will then remove over-age or physically unfit fighters, two military sources said.  \u201cThe plan will be implemented with extreme caution and precision in order to prevent a negative backlash from the PMF commanders,\u201d said an army colonel who was briefed on it by his commander. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep a second army within one state; this is the key objective of the plan.\u201d  The plan will be closely followed by Iran and the United States. The groups are one of Iran\u2019s many levers of influence in Iraq, while for Washington they are a reminder of Tehran\u2019s growing reach in the Middle East.  Lawmakers close to Abadi and one of his political advisers say he is coming under \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d from the West and Sunni regional allies to dissolve the PMF now that Islamic State, or Daesh, is no longer a major threat.  \u201cPrime Minister Abadi is getting messages from allies in the war against Daesh encouraging him to dismantle the PMF as a condition to keeping their support flowing in future,\u201d the adviser said on condition of anonymity.   In a phone call last month, French President Emmanuel Macron encouraged Abadi to dismantle the PMF, said the adviser, who was briefed on the call.  With Islamic State crushed in Iraq, Abadi will find it harder to avoid clamping down on the militia, according to a lawmaker from his Dawa Party.  \u201cAbadi would respond to pressure from his Western and Gulf allies to dissolve the PMF by saying he needs them to fight Daesh, but now Daesh is finished and there are no more excuses to keep the PMF,\u201d the lawmaker said.  In any case Abadi does not trust the Iranians, whose  militia allies act like a state within a state, said a Shi\u2019ite lawmaker close to the prime minister.  \u201cAbadi sees the support of the West, the United States and regional Arab states as indispensable in making Iraq more stable in future,\u201d the lawmaker said.  But militia commanders, such as Ali al-Hussaini from the Imam Ali Brigades, say the PMF played a major part in defeating Islamic State and dismantling them would be a \u201cbig mistake\u201d.  \u201cWe have millions of followers who will defend our rights against any attempt to target us,\u201d he said.  Nonetheless, a joint committee from the army, police, and intelligence services will review the number of PMF fighters and make recommendations to Abadi, who will decide who will stay and who will be retired, said a military intelligence colonel who is close to the military chief of staff\u2019s office.  Abadi would also order his commanders to restructure their own forces.  Another army colonel said taking heavy weapons from the militias would not be easy, as they control hundreds of headquarters, arms stockpiles, camps, and even small rocket factories.  Disarming the militias is one of Abadi\u2019s most delicate challenges. They are generally more effective than the Iraqi security forces and often defy Baghdad with the support of Tehran.  They also have the blessing of Iraq\u2019s most influential Shi\u2019ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.  Iraqi Shi\u2019ite militia commanders are openly loyal to Tehran, Iranian advisers are seen on Iraqi battlefields, and Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Abadi in June against weakening the militias.  The PMF gained prominence after Sistani called on Iraqis to take up arms against Islamic State when it seized a third of the country in 2014.  Since then the militias have become more assertive, riding around cities in vehicles flying their own flags. They are accused of terrorizing minority Sunnis, which they deny.  Security sources and analysts say any attempt by Abadi to muzzle the PMF could invite a backlash from Shi\u2019ites, who expect the militias to protect them in the event of renewed sectarian conflict in Iraq.  Any backlash could lead to the election of an alliance of Iranian-backed political parties to enough seats in parliament to end Abadi\u2019s bid for a second term.  Abadi\u2019s success against Islamic State and in quashing a Kurdish bid for independence in Iraq may tempt him into over-confidence in acting against the militias, said Jasim al-Bahadli, a Baghdad-based expert on Shi\u2019ite armed groups.  \u201cPlaying hard with the PMF could be a double-edged sword; they have broad popularity that Abadi should not underestimate.\u201d   To counter the PMF\u2019s popularity, Abadi has turned to the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who once led an armed rebellion against U.S. occupation forces and was named the most dangerous man in Iraq by the Pentagon.  The pair held a secret meeting in the holy Shi\u2019ite city of Karbala on Nov. 11 to discuss Sadr helping the government disarm the militias, according to aides for both men who attended the meeting.  Sadr sees the militias as a threat to his role as a kingmaker in Iraq\u2019s turbulent politics.  During their meeting, Abadi asked Sadr to support him in his bid to \u201ccleanse the country\u201d of corrupt politicians and those who might try to use armed groups to influence the election, an adviser to Sadr said.  \u201cThey talked about putting an end to the militias operating above the law, fighting corruption, and of course supporting Abadi\u2019s bid to be prime minister for a second\u00a0term,\u201d he said.  Several lawmakers close to Abadi and sources close to Sadr said the prime minister had secured the cleric\u2019s support to stop the PMF interfering in the election.  \u201cSadr can put hundreds of thousands on the streets in solidarity with Abadi with one call, he would make Abadi\u2019s opponents think twice before challenging him,\u201d said a senior Shi\u2019ite politician close to Sadr.  Indeed, Sadr plans to do just that in the very near future, another source close to him said.  Sources close to Sadr said he also promised to persuade Sistani to support Abadi\u2019s plans to restrain the militias.   That could give Abadi an edge over the militias, which comprise more than 66 groups, over 40 of which are backed by Iran, according to security sources and analysts.  It would also put Abadi in a strong position against one of his main challengers, Hadi al-Amiri, who commands Iraq\u2019s\u00a0largest Iranian-backed Shi\u2019ite militia, the Badr Organisation.  \u201cBadr will lead the PMF list in next election under the leadership of Hadi al-Amiri,\u201d said Ameer al-Kinani, a Sadrist adviser to Iraqi President Fuad Masum. \u201cThis is known to all.\u201d  Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed; Writing by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Michael Georgy and Giles Elgood"

          "body": " NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is ramping up calls on the U.S. Congress to stop legal immigrants from sponsoring extended family members who want to move to the United States, saying so-called \u201cchain migration\u201d poses a threat to national security.  Even without legislative action, however, the number of immigrants approved for family-based visas has dropped this year to the lowest level in more than a decade, a Reuters review of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data shows. The drop has not been previously reported.  The Trump administration has taken a series of measures to more closely scrutinize legal immigration. These steps have been overshadowed by Trump\u2019s more public efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, such as his calls for a wall along the Mexican border and more arrests of people living in the country illegally.  Lately though, Trump has increasingly been taking aim at chain migration, saying it allows a single immigrant \u201cto bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations,\u201d with \u201cno real selection criteria.\u201d He said a Bangladeshi man who set off a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded New York City commuter hub in December was a prime example of the dangers of the system.  Immigration advocates counter that no one automatically qualifies for a visa because a relative is already in the United States. All immigrants undergo security vetting and can face years-long waits before they are given a green light.  The intensified focus on chain migration has been accompanied by an overall slowdown in adjudications of family-based visas, known as I-130s, the Reuters review shows.  The number of approvals dropped by nearly a quarter in the first nine months of 2017 to around 406,000 compared to the same period a year earlier when approvals were more than 530,000, despite a similar number of applications during both periods, USCIS data showed.  The drop was even starker when looking only at I-130s approved for relatives who were not immediate family members. Those fell by 70 percent in the same period, from more than 108,000 in the first nine months of 2016 to 32,500 in the same period in 2017. The entire 2017 fiscal year had the lowest number of approvals for extended family visas since 2000.  USCIS said that since there are a limited number of visas for this category, it prioritizes processing visas that are more immediately available. The agency also said there are normal year-to-year fluctuations in the number of visas that are filed and decided. \u00a0  At the core of the administration\u2019s long-term policy goal is a belief that immigration should be merit-based.  \u201cThose people are just coming in based on connection to a family member,\u201d the new director of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna said in a telephone interview, referring to chain migrants.\u00a0\u201dThat lack of selectivity; it takes us away from where we want to go as a country.\u201d  Cissna said no specific policy guidance has been put in place at USCIS to change the way family-based visas are issued.\u00a0He also said there were no plans to restrict visas for immediate family members and pointed out that approvals of visas and citizenship applications overall are still high.  He has said, however, that his agency is looking closely at all visa categories to root out fraud. USCIS said separately that closer scrutiny could lead to longer processing times.  For example, H-1B temporary work visas for high-skilled workers are facing more hurdles, and applications are receiving far more requests for evidence, slowing down the whole program, according to immigration lawyers and data provided by the government. [nL2N1LY0F5]  USCIS has also put in place new interview requirements for U.S. citizens seeking to bring over their fianc\u00e9s. In the first nine months of 2017, approvals of fianc\u00e9 visas dropped by 35 percent over the same period a year earlier, the Reuters data review found.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Immigration supporters said any efforts by the administration to restrict the entry of family members of migrants was shortsighted.\u00a0They \u201cbring drive and entrepreneurial spirit to the United States,\u201d said Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration law expert at Cornell University.\u00a0  Chain migration has long been a target of groups that favor more restrictions on legal immigration. The idea, supported by organizations like NumbersUSA, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), failed to gain much traction at the highest levels of power in Washington before Trump took office.  \u201cWe have been talking about this for a long time but we were kind of out there in the wilderness\u201d said Ira Mehlman from FAIR. \u201cIt was never at this level of discussion before.\u201d  Now supporters of the ideas of restricting chain migration and tightening standards for legal immigration occupy key positions in the administration. They include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who remains vocal on the issue, and his long-time aide Stephen Miller, who is now one of Trump\u2019s closest policy advisers.  The current USCIS ombudsman Julie Kirchner was previously the executive director of FAIR.  The White House and the Department of Justice did not respond to questions about the influence of the groups, which critics say are anti-immigrant, on administration policy.\u00a0  Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at CIS, said she and her colleagues \u201care in fairly regular contact with various administration officials as they solicit suggestions and ideas to improve policies.\u201d She said she had also spoken to officials in the Obama administration, but only occasionally.  Earlier this month NumbersUSA launched a national advertising campaign against chain migration. A day later the White House posted a presentation on the same subject making many of the same points.  NumbersUSA director Roy Beck said any similarity in the points was just a coincidence. Still, he is thrilled that his group\u2019s ideas on restricting legal immigration have been \u201ccatapulted onto the main stage in an unprecedented way,\u201d he said in an interview.  In April, Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to draft new rules and guidance for the legal immigration system. In August, the White House backed the RAISE Act, proposed legislation sponsored by two Republican lawmakers, that aimed to cut legal immigration by 50 percent over 10 years.

          "title": "Turkey says U.S. conviction of banker is 'unprecedented interference'",
          "body": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey on Thursday condemned the U.S. conviction of a Turkish banker for evading Iran sanctions as unprecedented meddling in its internal affairs, pushing back against a case that President Tayyip Erdogan has cast as a political attack.   Wednesday\u2019s court decision capped a trial that had strained diplomatic relations between the two countries and is likely to further aggravate tension between the NATO allies.  The case has angered Erdogan and his ministers, some of whom accuse U.S. court officials of ties to a cleric blamed for a 2016 coup attempt. Some of the testimony at the trial implicated senior officials, including Erdogan. Ankara has said the case was based on fabricated evidence.  Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank (HALKB.IS), was convicted on five of six counts in a Manhattan federal court, including bank fraud and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions law.  \u201cThe U.S. court, in a process carried out by relying on so-called \u2018evidence\u2019, which is fake and open to political exploitation, ... made an unprecedented interference in Turkey\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry said.  U.S. prosecutors have charged a total of nine people in the case, including a former economy minister, Zafer Caglayan. However, only Atilla and a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab, are in U.S. custody.   Erdogan, who has yet to comment on the decision, has previously dismissed the trial as a politically motivated attack on his government, and has attempted to use it to tap into anti-American sentiment among his supporters.  Ankara has not, however, threatened to take concrete measures.  The U.S. case against Atilla was based on the testimony of the gold trader Zarrab, who cooperated with U.S. prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of leading a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.  In his testimony Zarrab implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said Erdogan, who has governed Turkey for nearly 15 years, personally authorized two Turkish banks to join the scheme when he was prime minister.  \u201cThe Zarrab court case is a political plot\u201d, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag tweeted on Thursday.  Halkbank said Atilla had the right to appeal against the decision and said it had not been a party to the U.S. case. It noted there had been no financial or administrative decision taken against it by the court.  The bank has denied any wrongdoing and said its transactions were in line with local and international regulations. Halkbank shares were flat by late afternoon, giving up gains after  advancing more than 4 percent.  The court decision is unlikely to damage Erdogan or his government at home, said Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence, a London-based consultancy.  \u201cDomestically, I don\u2019t believe it will make any difference at all... The government has managed to cast a huge shadow on it by portraying it as a plot against Turkey and the government,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cI think it is much more important in terms of the bilateral relations with the United States. This is a relationship that has been difficult for some time.\u201d  Less clear was the potential fall-out for the banking sector, with some analysts seeing the possibility that one or more Turkish lenders could be hit by fines over the case.  \u201cThe whole thing is really about what the consequences will be for the relationship between Turkey and the U.S.,\u201d said Paul Fage of TD Securities in London.  \u201cObviously, the U.S. will impose fines, and the question will be how Turkey is going to respond to that, and whether this is going to escalate into some tit-for-tat thing.\u201d  Turkey has said it will take any necessary measures to protect its banks from the potential impact of the case. \u201cIf anything is going to happen, in this situation we will stand by the banks,\u201d Finance Minister Naci Agbal told Reuters last month.  \u201cWe must not allow any eventuality that would weaken our banking system.\u201d  Additional reporting by Ali Kucukgocmen in Istanbul and Karin Strohecker in London; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Janet Lawrence"

          "body": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish authorities have prepared an extradition request for a witness who testified in the U.S. case against a Turkish banker, state-run Anadolu news agency said on Thursday.  On Wednesday the jury in the U.S. case found the executive of Turkish state lender Halkbank (HALKB.IS) guilty of helping Iran evade sanctions. The Turkish government called the verdict scandalous and unjust.  The witness, Huseyin Korkmaz, is a former police investigator who collected evidence against government officials in a 2013 corruption case, which included some of the same defendants as the trial now ending in the United States. Anadolu said Turkish authorities had also issued a warrant for his arrest.  Korkmaz was jailed in Turkey following the 2013 investigation. He was later released and fled to the United States, bringing the evidence he collected with him, he told jurors at the Manhattan court. He said he feared being tortured if he were returned to Turkey.  He also said he had received $50,000 from the FBI and financial assistance from U.S. prosecutors.   Last month, Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul, in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asked that Korkmaz be returned to Turkey, calling him \u201ca fugitive, a terror suspect facing serious allegations\u201d.  Turkish officials have also accused the judge overseeing the case and two U.S. attorneys involved, Kim H. Joon and Preet Bharara, of cooperating with U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Joon called the allegations ridiculous.  Ankara has described the 2013 corruption investigation and arrests as a \u201cjudicial coup\u201d by Gulen supporters who had infiltrated the judiciary and police.  Ankara also blames Gulen for the coup attempt of July 2016, during which more than 240 people were killed. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, denies involvement.  Since the abortive putsch, more than 50,000 people, including civil servants and security personnel, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs, mostly on suspicion of links to terrorist groups.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) paid their top bankers in Britain an average of $1.5 million each in 2016, compared with $1 million for local rivals HSBC (HSBA.L) and Barclays (BARC.L), data released by the banks last year shows.  Data compiled by Reuters from 13 banks\u2019 filings, some of which were released only late last month, shows they paid an average of $1.06 million to such staff in 2016, down from $2 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013 when new European Union rules aimed at curbing banker bonuses took effect.  The Wall Street banks\u2019 higher pay packages show how they have bounced back more quickly from the financial crisis than their peers in Britain, some of which have faced hefty post-crisis costs that have limited banker pay.  The data also shows that EU rules to rein in banker bonuses, blamed for driving excessive risk-taking in the run up to the 2008 crisis, are having an impact.  JPMorgan paid 672 staff in senior or risk-taking positions a total of $1.02 billion in 2016 for an average of $1.52 million each, while 724 Goldman bankers took home an average of $1.48 million each, according to Reuters\u2019 calculations from the filings.      U.S. banks were also able to capitalize more effectively than European rivals on spikes in volatility in financial markets in 2016 from Britain\u2019s June Brexit vote.  Europe\u2019s top investment banks\u2019 trading in fixed income products fell by 6 percent in the second quarter of 2016, while their five biggest U.S. rivals reported a 21 percent increase to $13.1 billion in revenue from the same business.  The disclosures are among the most comprehensive released on bankers\u2019 pay in Britain, which remains a controversial subject ten years on from the financial crisis.      A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development released on Thursday showed that a median worker salary in Britain is about $38,493. In contrast, the average pay of a senior banker in 2016 was $1.06 million.   The report highlighted that the average boss of one of Britain\u2019s top companies will by Thursday have already earned the same as the typical worker will make in the entire year.  The banks\u2019 pay disclosures make no mention of gender pay gaps, but banks in Britain may have to begin reporting such data after the government last April announced employers would have to disclose the difference between what they pay men and women by April 2018.  The average pay levels for bankers in the filings were boosted by a handful of top earners, with 10 Goldman bankers earning the highest band of more than 9 million euros in 2016 while 14 JPMorgan executives took home that lender\u2019s top bracket of over 5 million euros each.  The pay disclosures focus on banks\u2019 senior executives and \u2018material risk takers\u2019, and show how an EU rule that came into force in 2014 capping variable or bonus pay at 200 percent of fixed pay has cut fat bonuses.  While Goldman Sachs paid senior staff more than five times more in variable pay than fixed in 2013, before the rule took effect, that ratio fell in 2016 to 0.6 times.  Goldman in 2016 paid the top bankers $679 million in cash, and gave them 1.63 million shares in the bank which were worth a total of $389.6 million based on the bank\u2019s year-end share price of $239.  Analysis of the filings also shows how regulators have sought to broaden the number of bankers deemed material risk takers, with the total whose pay is captured by the data rising from 2,604 in 2013 to 8,360 in 2016.  The disclosures cover British banks globally and overseas banks\u2019 British-based staff, and contain more detail than is found in pay disclosures in other non-EU regions.  Most banks released the details earlier last year, but some banks such as Goldman reported last month just before the year-end deadline.  Goldman declined to comment.

Federer stepped up his preparation for the Australian Open with a 7-6(5) 7-5 win in an absorbing match to give his side a 1-0 lead in front of a record Perth Arena crowd of 14,029.  The 19-times grand slam champion opened up a 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker of an evenly-matched first set but Sock levelled at 4-4 with a flurry of powerful drives. Federer then took control, producing a neat backhand volley to close out the first set.  The second set went with serve up to 4-4 before Sock missed an opportunity to break. The American world number eight then double-faulted at 5-5 as Federer pounced to snatch a decisive break and went on to seal the win.  \u201cI\u2019ve maintained a high level in all three matches, which is a great thing,\u201d Federer said after the match.  \u201cThis was another step up in terms of ranking and I thought it was a very entertaining match for both of us...

Ryan Allen, who described the drink as a \u201cnational treasure\u201d, is behind an online petition calling on the company to reverse its decision. \u201cHands off our IRN BRU\u201d has more than 8,000 supporters.  \u201cI believe that a responsible adult should have the choice as to what poisons they want to put in their body,\u201d he told BBC radio, adding that he had stockpiled the classic version.  \u201cI\u2019ve got 24 glass bottles in my loft that will do me for emergencies.\u201d  AG Barr, based just outside Glasgow, said last autumn it would cut the amount of sugar in Irn Bru at the start of 2018 to just below 5 grams per 100 ml from 10 grams.  That followed a British government decision to impose a levy on makers of sugary drinks. Replacing some of the sugar with sweeteners will take Irn Bru out of the top tax band and reduce its calorie count to about 66 from 140, the manufacturer said.  For Allen, the world is a tough enough place without messing with his favorite soft drink.  \u201cIt\u2019s ... well known to alleviate the effects of a hangover and is many a persons\u2019 craving, savior or go-to drink after a night on the tiles,\u201d he said.  \u201cI think to deny people in that condition their crutch would be a crime.\u201d     Reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; Editing by Alistair Smout and Robin Pomeroy"

          "body": "OSLO (Reuters) - Budget carrier Norwegian Air (NWC.OL) is better prepared to cope with peak travel seasons in 2018, and does not plan to rent expensive aircraft or crews from other companies, Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos told reporters on Thursday.  The rapidly growing airline incurred unforeseen leasing costs of around 1 billion Norwegian crowns ($123.71 million) in the summer of 2017 after a spate of cancellations left passengers stranded in airports.  The problems, similar to those of competitor Ryanair (RYA.I), quickly led to a scramble among low-cost airlines to recruit more senior pilots.  Norwegian will add some 25 new Boeing (BA.N) aircraft to its fleet this year under a long-term investment plan.  \u201cWe\u2019re much better prepared entering 2018 than we were last year, and we won\u2019t have to hire planes. We\u2019ll be fully covered, with crews,\u201d Kjos told a news conference.  The company\u2019s bookings for the coming year are also stronger than they were at the same time a year ago, even when taking into account the growth in its fleet, he added.

          "body": "SEGGAU, Austria (Reuters) - Austria\u2019s ruling coalition of conservatives and the far right plans to cut benefit payments for children living abroad, it said on Thursday, adding that it believes the move does not break European Union rules banning discrimination.  Chancellor Sebastian Kurz\u2019s cabinet was sworn in on Dec. 18, two months after his conservative People\u2019s Party won the  parliamentary election. It struck a coalition deal with the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), making Austria the only western European country with a far-right party in government.   The FPO controls the interior, foreign, defense and social affairs ministries, among others.  At the start of a two-day cabinet meeting in a castle near Slovenia, Kurz said the government would cut benefits for Austrian residents\u2019 children who live in a country where the cost of living is lower.  \u201cIt is an unfairness built into the system that, for two children who do not even live in Austria but in Romania, roughly 300 euros a month are transferred to Romania and that is almost the average income there,\u201d Kurz told reporters standing alongside Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache.  Payments vary depending on children\u2019s age and number but start around 114 euros ($138) a month for an only child.  \u201cWe will reach a decision in cabinet here so that child benefit payments are not made abroad to the same extent as before,\u201d Kurz said, adding that adjusting payments to the local cost of living would save \u201cmore than 100 million euros (a year)\u201d.    That pales in comparison with the 2.5 billion euros in savings the government aims to make this year. Kurz said the move was being made so quickly because it was one of the easiest to prepare.  The plan is part of a broader government agenda that includes cutting taxes, reducing benefits for refugees and restricting new immigrants\u2019 access to many social services for five years.  Austria borders eight countries, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, where wages are significantly lower. Eastern Europeans make up a large part of its workforce in sectors including healthcare and construction.  In 2016 Austria transferred 273 million euros abroad to EU and European Economic Area countries in benefit payments for 132,000 children.  The European Commission criticized Germany last year for a similar plan to cut child benefits, which was later abandoned. It gave a guarded reaction on Thursday.  \u201cWe take note and we will examine the laws with regard to their compatibility with EU law if and once adopted,\u201d a Commission spokeswoman said.  Kurz said a legal paper commissioned by the government \u201cclearly shows that it is legally possible to take these measures\u201d, adding: \u201cWe have prepared this well.\u201d  ($1 = 0.8289 euros)  Reporting by Francois Murphy; Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in Vienna and Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"

          "body": "OXFORD, England (Reuters) - Britain will only pay public funds to farmers who provide public benefits such as wildlife habitats or improved soil quality under a post-Brexit shake-up in agricultural policies announced on Thursday.  Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who spoke at two farming conferences in Oxford, also said the government would \u201clook at ways to support farmers who may choose to leave the industry.\u201d  British farming is set for a radical overhaul after the country leaves the European Union in March 2019, when, for the first time in decades, the country will have a chance to create its own agricultural policy.  Farmers in Britain will have to compete for government funds with departments such as health and education once Brussels hands over the purse strings for farming budgets to London.  Under the European Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),    British farmers receive about 3 billion pounds ($4 billion) a year in public funds.  Gove, who criticized the CAP\u2019s \u201cfundamentally flawed design\u201d, estimated that around 80 percent of the funding was based on the size of farmers\u2019 productive agricultural land.  \u201cI think that money is poorly spent. Ultimately public money should go towards people who are thinking hard and working hard in order to ensure our environment is enhanced,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf we are going to have 3 billion pounds spent then that money should be an investment in the future rather than an incentive to carry on just as people have been doing.\u201d  The new policy announced by Gove will apply only in England, after a transition period. Policies may differ in Scotland and Wales where devolved administrations control farm spending.  Gove said the current system of area-based funding, known as the basic payment scheme (BPS), would continue over a transition period in England after Britain leaves the EU to give farmers enough time to change their business model if necessary.  \u201cAfter the transition, we will replace BPS with a system of public money for public goods,\u201d he said.  Gove said BPS payments may continue until the end of 2024 although they would be reduced in England \u201ceither through a straight cap at the maximum level or through a sliding scale of reductions, to the largest payments first.\u201d  On average, British farmers get about 15,000 pounds a year from direct payments and an EU rural development fund.

          "title": "Turkey says U.S. conviction of banker is 'unprecedented interference'",
          "body": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey on Thursday condemned the U.S. conviction of a Turkish banker for evading Iran sanctions as unprecedented meddling in its internal affairs, pushing back against a case that President Tayyip Erdogan has cast as a political attack.   Wednesday\u2019s court decision capped a trial that had strained diplomatic relations between the two countries and is likely to further aggravate tension between the NATO allies.  The case has angered Erdogan and his ministers, some of whom accuse U.S. court officials of ties to a cleric blamed for a 2016 coup attempt. Some of the testimony at the trial implicated senior officials, including Erdogan. Ankara has said the case was based on fabricated evidence.  Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank (HALKB.IS), was convicted on five of six counts in a Manhattan federal court, including bank fraud and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions law.  \u201cThe U.S. court, in a process carried out by relying on so-called \u2018evidence\u2019, which is fake and open to political exploitation, ... made an unprecedented interference in Turkey\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry said.  U.S. prosecutors have charged a total of nine people in the case, including a former economy minister, Zafer Caglayan. However, only Atilla and a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab, are in U.S. custody.   Erdogan, who has yet to comment on the decision, has previously dismissed the trial as a politically motivated attack on his government, and has attempted to use it to tap into anti-American sentiment among his supporters.  Ankara has not, however, threatened to take concrete measures.  The U.S. case against Atilla was based on the testimony of the gold trader Zarrab, who cooperated with U.S. prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of leading a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.  In his testimony Zarrab implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said Erdogan, who has governed Turkey for nearly 15 years, personally authorized two Turkish banks to join the scheme when he was prime minister.  \u201cThe Zarrab court case is a political plot\u201d, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag tweeted on Thursday.  Halkbank said Atilla had the right to appeal against the decision and said it had not been a party to the U.S. case. It noted there had been no financial or administrative decision taken against it by the court.  The bank has denied any wrongdoing and said its transactions were in line with local and international regulations. Halkbank shares were flat by late afternoon, giving up gains after  advancing more than 4 percent.  The court decision is unlikely to damage Erdogan or his government at home, said Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence, a London-based consultancy.  \u201cDomestically, I don\u2019t believe it will make any difference at all... The government has managed to cast a huge shadow on it by portraying it as a plot against Turkey and the government,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cI think it is much more important in terms of the bilateral relations with the United States. This is a relationship that has been difficult for some time.\u201d  Less clear was the potential fall-out for the banking sector, with some analysts seeing the possibility that one or more Turkish lenders could be hit by fines over the case.  \u201cThe whole thing is really about what the consequences will be for the relationship between Turkey and the U.S.,\u201d said Paul Fage of TD Securities in London.  \u201cObviously, the U.S. will impose fines, and the question will be how Turkey is going to respond to that, and whether this is going to escalate into some tit-for-tat thing.\u201d  Turkey has said it will take any necessary measures to protect its banks from the potential impact of the case. \u201cIf anything is going to happen, in this situation we will stand by the banks,\u201d Finance Minister Naci Agbal told Reuters last month.  \u201cWe must not allow any eventuality that would weaken our banking system.\u201d  Additional reporting by Ali Kucukgocmen in Istanbul and Karin Strohecker in London; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Janet Lawrence"

The state donated shares worth 50 million euros ($60 million) to a Finnish foundation that promotes the wellbeing of children, reducing the state\u2019s Neste holding to 49.7 percent from 50.1 percent, the government said in a statement.  The centre-right government last year got the parliament\u2019s mandate to cut the Neste stake to 33.4 percent as it seeks funds for potential investments in new growth companies.  But this prompted protests from employee groups who were worried that such a move could put Neste\u2019s Finnish jobs at risk.  The government has not made a decision about the sale of the 16 percent stake, but a new state-owned company which will handle those shares began operation this week.  \u201cNo one knows when it would happen, but the assumption is that the shares will be sold, mainly to institutional investors... That would improve liquidity of the stock,\u201d Henri Parkkinen, analyst at OP Equities, said.  He said that stakes of that size were usually placed in the market at a small discount.  Neste\u2019s share price has climbed 48 percent in the past year on the back of the company\u2019s profit growth. The stock fell 1.6 percent on Thursday.

          "body": "(Refiles to additional subscribers)  By Gus Trompiz and Huw Jones  PARIS/LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Euronext has joined a growing list of exchanges to win a reprieve from a new rule aimed at promoting competition in clearing services for derivatives trades.  The pan-European exchange becomes the fourth exchange this week to be granted a waiver until July 2020 from having to comply with an \u201copen access\u201d rule under a European Union law known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II or MiFID II, introduced on Wednesday.  Under the new system aimed at increasing competition, an exchange would have to make available data from a derivatives transaction to any clearing house.  At present, investors are effectively locked into using an exchange\u2019s clearer of choice, typically owned in-house. Clearing ensures a trade is completed even if one side of the deal goes bust.  Euronext operates stock and derivatives trading platforms in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon.  Regulators in France, Belgium and Portugal have granted an open access waiver in respect of derivatives, Euronext told Reuters. The exchange is still waiting for the outcome of a waiver request to regulators in the Netherlands.  It gave no immediate reason why it wanted waivers.  Regulators in Germany and Britain this week granted the same 11th-hour waiver to Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt, and ICE Futures Europe and London Metal Exchange.  UK regulators have said they granted waivers in the interests of keeping markets orderly as other aspects of MiFID II, a sweeping reform, are digested by markets.  Deutsche Boerse has said a waiver was needed due to legal uncertainty created by Britain leaving the EU next year.  Euronext uses LCH to clear its transactions.  LCH is majority owned by the London Stock Exchange which is one of the region\u2019s biggest supporters of open access. It has not asked regulators for a waiver.  \u201cOur open access approach will continue, working in partnership with our customers to promote greater choice, transparency and innovation in financial markets, in order to reduce risk and maximise capital and operational efficiencies,\u201d an LSE spokeswoman said.  The EU\u2019s markets regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority, said on Wednesday that all waivers from open access will be \u201cone-offs\u201d.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May apologized on Thursday to tens of thousands of patients whose operations were canceled to free up staff and beds to deal with emergency patients.  Earlier this week, officials at the National Health Service (NHS) in England recommended that hospitals cancel all non-urgent appointments and operations until next month.  May, during a visit to a hospital outside London, said she recognized it is frustrating for patients who had their operations postponed.  \u201cI know it is difficult, I know it is frustrating, I know it is disappointing for people and I apologize,\u201d she told Sky News.   A flu outbreak, colder weather and high levels of respiratory illnesses have put hospitals in England under strain with many operating at or near full capacity.  The issue is potentially damaging for May, already weakened after losing a parliamentary majority in last year\u2019s election and struggling to pacify her deeply divided party as she navigates the final year of Brexit negotiations.  The NHS, which delivers free care for all and accounts for a third of government spending on public services, is typically one of the most important issues for voters during elections and one which is often regarded as a weakness for May\u2019s Conservative party.  Opposition parties regularly accuse the government of failing to adequately fund the health service.  \u201cMinisters refused to provide the funding top NHS officials said was necessary and now patients are paying the price,\u201d said Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats.   Founded in 1948 by the opposition Labour Party, the NHS is a source of huge pride for many Britons who are able to access free care from cradle to grave.  But tight budgets, an aging population and increasingly complex medical needs have left many hospitals struggling during the winter in recent years.  The pressure continues to grow, according to new data on Thursday.  The number of patients stuck in ambulances for at least an hour almost doubled to more 4,700 cases during the Christmas week compared with the week before.  Department of Health guidelines say ambulance crews should be able to hand patients over to hospital staff within 15 minutes of arrival at hospital.  The average bed occupancy for the Christmas week was 91.7 percent. Doctors say that anything above 85 percent is unsafe.  The conditions have led some doctors taking to Twitter to vent their frustrations.  One London-based doctor wrote that conditions were so bad that he was practicing \u201cbattlefield medicine\u201d, while another apologized for the \u201c3rd world conditions\u201d caused by overcrowding.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December and planned layoffs by American-based companies fell sharply, pointing to sustained labor market strength that likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to increase interest rates in March.  Other data on Thursday showed a third straight weekly rise in first-time applications for unemployment benefits, though that probably reflected volatility around the end-of-year holidays.   The Labor Department said claims data for some states, including California, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Virginia, had been estimated. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.   \u201cHigher jobless claims are not signaling a slowdown in the economy, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. \u201cThe labor market looks strong and the outlook for 2018 is even better.\u201d  The ADP Research Institute said private payrolls increased by 250,000 jobs in December, the biggest gain since March, and well above economists\u2019 expectations for a rise of 190,000.    The ADP National Employment Report is jointly developed with Moody\u2019s Analytics.  The gains in employment were broad-based last month. Manufacturing payrolls rose by 9,000 and employment in the construction sector increased by 16,000.\u00a0The service-providing industries added another 222,000 jobs last month.The ADP report was released ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s more comprehensive employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 190,000 jobs in December after a gain of 228,000 in November.  The tightening labor market encouraged the Fed to raise interest rates three times last year despite inflation persistently undershooting the U.S. central bank\u2019s 2 percent target.   Minutes of the Fed\u2019s Dec. 12-13 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed officials upbeat about the economy and labor market prospects. They viewed economic activity as \u201crising at a solid rate,\u201d and the labor market as continuing to strengthen.[nW1N1LO001]  The Fed has forecast three rate hikes for 2018. Some economists, however, expect the central bank to lift borrowing costs four times this year, citing the impact of the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts passed by the Republican-led Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.  In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers  announced 32,423 job cuts in December, a 7.4 percent decrease from November. That brought the total number of layoffs in 2017 to 418,770, the fewest since 1990. Employers announced 526,915 job cuts in 2016.  The dollar rose against the yen and trimmed losses versus the euro after the ADP report. Major stock indexes on Wall Street hit fresh record highs in early morning trading, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.   In a third report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 250,000 for the week ended Dec. 30.   Last week marked the 148th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December and planned layoffs by American-based companies fell sharply, pointing to sustained labor market strength that likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to increase interest rates in March.  Other data on Thursday showed a third straight weekly rise in first-time applications for unemployment benefits, though that probably reflected volatility around the end-of-year holidays.   The Labor Department said claims data for some states, including California, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Virginia, had been estimated. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.   \u201cHigher jobless claims are not signaling a slowdown in the economy, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. \u201cThe labor market looks strong and the outlook for 2018 is even better.\u201d  The ADP Research Institute said private payrolls increased by 250,000 jobs in December, the biggest gain since March, and well above economists\u2019 expectations for a rise of 190,000.    The ADP National Employment Report is jointly developed with Moody\u2019s Analytics.  The gains in employment were broad-based last month. Manufacturing payrolls rose by 9,000 and employment in the construction sector increased by 16,000.\u00a0The service-providing industries added another 222,000 jobs last month.The ADP report was released ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s more comprehensive employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 190,000 jobs in December after a gain of 228,000 in November.  The tightening labor market encouraged the Fed to raise interest rates three times last year despite inflation persistently undershooting the U.S. central bank\u2019s 2 percent target.   Minutes of the Fed\u2019s Dec. 12-13 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed officials upbeat about the economy and labor market prospects. They viewed economic activity as \u201crising at a solid rate,\u201d and the labor market as continuing to strengthen.[nW1N1LO001]  The Fed has forecast three rate hikes for 2018. Some economists, however, expect the central bank to lift borrowing costs four times this year, citing the impact of the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts passed by the Republican-led Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.  In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers  announced 32,423 job cuts in December, a 7.4 percent decrease from November. That brought the total number of layoffs in 2017 to 418,770, the fewest since 1990. Employers announced 526,915 job cuts in 2016.  The dollar rose against the yen and trimmed losses versus the euro after the ADP report. Major stock indexes on Wall Street hit fresh record highs in early morning trading, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.   In a third report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 250,000 for the week ended Dec. 30.   Last week marked the 148th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.  The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased by 3,500 to 241,750 last week.  \u201cSeasonal adjustment is especially challenging around year-end,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. \u201cThrough the volatility, the data continue to signal strength in employment growth.\u201d  Thursday\u2019s claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped by 37,000 to 1.91 million in the week ended Dec. 23.

          "body": "OSLO (Reuters) - Budget carrier Norwegian Air (NWC.OL) is better prepared to cope with peak travel seasons in 2018, and does not plan to rent expensive aircraft or crews from other companies, Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos told reporters on Thursday.  The rapidly growing airline incurred unforeseen leasing costs of around 1 billion Norwegian crowns ($123.71 million) in the summer of 2017 after a spate of cancellations left passengers stranded in airports.  The problems, similar to those of competitor Ryanair (RYA.I), quickly led to a scramble among low-cost airlines to recruit more senior pilots.  Norwegian will add some 25 new Boeing (BA.N) aircraft to its fleet this year under a long-term investment plan.  \u201cWe\u2019re much better prepared entering 2018 than we were last year, and we won\u2019t have to hire planes. We\u2019ll be fully covered, with crews,\u201d Kjos told a news conference.

          "title": "JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs come top of banker pay league in Britain",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) paid their top bankers in Britain an average of $1.5 million each in 2016, compared with $1 million for local rivals HSBC (HSBA.L) and Barclays (BARC.L), data released by the banks last year shows.  Data compiled by Reuters from 13 banks\u2019 filings, some of which were released only late last month, shows they paid an average of $1.06 million to such staff in 2016, down from $2 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013 when new European Union rules aimed at curbing banker bonuses took effect.  The Wall Street banks\u2019 higher pay packages show how they have bounced back more quickly from the financial crisis than their peers in Britain, some of which have faced hefty post-crisis costs that have limited banker pay.  The data also shows that EU rules to rein in banker bonuses, blamed for driving excessive risk-taking in the run up to the 2008 crisis, are having an impact.  JPMorgan paid 672 staff in senior or risk-taking positions a total of $1.02 billion in 2016 for an average of $1.52 million each, while 724 Goldman bankers took home an average of $1.48 million each, according to Reuters\u2019 calculations from the filings.      U.S. banks were also able to capitalize more effectively than European rivals on spikes in volatility in financial markets in 2016 from Britain\u2019s June Brexit vote.  Europe\u2019s top investment banks\u2019 trading in fixed income products fell by 6 percent in the second quarter of 2016, while their five biggest U.S. rivals reported a 21 percent increase to $13.1 billion in revenue from the same business.  The disclosures are among the most comprehensive released on bankers\u2019 pay in Britain, which remains a controversial subject ten years on from the financial crisis.      A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development released on Thursday showed that a median worker salary in Britain is about $38,493. In contrast, the average pay of a senior banker in 2016 was $1.06 million.   The report highlighted that the average boss of one of Britain\u2019s top companies will by Thursday have already earned the same as the typical worker will make in the entire year.  The banks\u2019 pay disclosures make no mention of gender pay gaps, but banks in Britain may have to begin reporting such data after the government last April announced employers would have to disclose the difference between what they pay men and women by April 2018.  The average pay levels for bankers in the filings were boosted by a handful of top earners, with 10 Goldman bankers earning the highest band of more than 9 million euros in 2016 while 14 JPMorgan executives took home that lender\u2019s top bracket of over 5 million euros each.  The pay disclosures focus on banks\u2019 senior executives and \u2018material risk takers\u2019, and show how an EU rule that came into force in 2014 capping variable or bonus pay at 200 percent of fixed pay has cut fat bonuses.  While Goldman Sachs paid senior staff more than five times more in variable pay than fixed in 2013, before the rule took effect, that ratio fell in 2016 to 0.6 times.  Goldman in 2016 paid the top bankers $679 million in cash, and gave them 1.63 million shares in the bank which were worth a total of $389.6 million based on the bank\u2019s year-end share price of $239.  Analysis of the filings also shows how regulators have sought to broaden the number of bankers deemed material risk takers, with the total whose pay is captured by the data rising from 2,604 in 2013 to 8,360 in 2016.  The disclosures cover British banks globally and overseas banks\u2019 British-based staff, and contain more detail than is found in pay disclosures in other non-EU regions.  Most banks released the details earlier last year, but some banks such as Goldman reported last month just before the year-end deadline.  Goldman declined to comment.

          "body": "HOUSTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Luxe Energy LLC said on Thursday it had received an additional $296 million from its private equity backers to buy and develop acreage in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield stretching across Texas and New Mexico.  NGP Energy Capital Management is increasing its funding for Luxe and a related company to $820 million, up from a previous commitment of $524 million.  This latest private equity investment in the U.S. shale industry is as much a bet on consolidation opportunities in the Permian as it is a vote of confidence in Luxe, which used a prior round of NGP funding two years ago to buy 18,000 acres and then within months sold it for a double-digit profit to Diamondback Energy Inc.  Luxe plans to use the cash to buy as much as 60,000 across the Permian that it would at some point in the future sell or list as a publicly traded company.  \u201cWe think there is a great opportunity for consolidation now\u201d in the Permian, Lance Langford, Luxe\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. \u201cWe want to build something big.\u201d  Luxe, formed in 2015 by Langford and other former Statoil executives, is betting that as publicly-traded oil producers focus more on cutting costs, they\u2019ll shed acreage that might be considered non-core.  \u201cWe can see what\u2019s hitting the market right now, and we\u2019re excited,\u201d said Langford. He declined to discuss potential or pending deals.  Luxe\u2019s operations team, staffed with some of Statoil\u2019s former Bakken Shale engineers, has yet to actually drill any wells together because the company quickly sold its initial acreage to Diamondback. That does not seem to bother Irving, Texas-based NGP.  \u201cWe have an extremely high degree of confidence in the technical and operational skill set of this team,\u201d NGP\u2019s Tony Weber said in a statement.  Ideally, Langford said, Luxe would quickly begin drilling any acreage it acquires with the fresh NGP funds.  The company will have to contend with spiking land costs in the Permian, considered one of the most-active oilfields in the world and one expected to grow more active with oil prices now trading about $60 per barrel. Oasis Petroleum Inc , for example, paid $946 million last month for 20,300 acres, or roughly $46,000 per acre.  The rising land costs could dent Luxe\u2019s plans to amass land holdings of as much as three times what Oasis acquired, though Langford said he was not dissuaded.  \u201cI have a team of roughly 30 that is always looking around at potential deals,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the economics are right, they\u2019ll know.\u201d (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by David Gregorio)"

          "body": "HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has unveiled a new, 10,000-strong military cyber warfare unit to counter \u201cwrong\u201d views on the Internet, media reported, amid a widening crackdown on critics of the one-party state.  The cyber unit, named Force 47, is already in operation in several sectors, Tuoi Tre newspaper quoted Lieutenant General Nguyen Trong Nghia, deputy head of the military\u2019s political department, as saying at a conference of the Central Propaganda Department on Monday in the commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City.   \u201cIn every hour, minute, and second we must be ready to fight proactively against the wrong views,\u201d\u00a0the paper quoted the general as saying.  Communist-ruled Vietnam has stepped up attempts to tame the internet, calling for closer watch over social networks and for the removal of content that it deems offensive, but there has been little sign of it silencing criticism when the companies providing the platforms are global.   Its neighbor China, in contrast, allows only local internet companies operating under strict rules.  The number of staff compares with the 6,000 reportedly employed by North Korea. However, the general\u2019s comments suggest its force may be focused largely on domestic internet users whereas North Korea is internationally focused because the internet is not available to the public at large.  In August, Vietnam\u2019s president said the country needed to pay greater attention to controlling \u201cnews sites and blogs with bad and dangerous content\u201d.  Vietnam, one of the top 10 countries for Facebook users by numbers, has also drafted an internet security bill asking for local placement of Facebook and Google servers, but the bill has been the subject of heated debate at the National Assembly and is still pending assembly approval.  Cyber security firm FireEye Inc (FEYE.O) said Vietnam had \u201cbuilt up considerable cyber espionage capabilities in a region with relatively weak defenses\u201d.  \u201cVietnam is certainly not alone. FireEye has observed a proliferation in offensive capabilities ... This proliferation has implications for many parties, including governments, journalists, activists and even multinational firms,\u201d a spokesman at FireEye, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.  \u201cCyber espionage is increasingly attractive to nation states, in part because it can provide access to a significant amount of information with a modest investment, plausible deniability and limited risk,\u201d he added.  Vietnam denies such charges.  Vietnam has in recent months stepped up measures to silence critics. A court last month jailed a blogger for seven years for \u201cconducting propaganda against the state\u201d.  In a separate, similar case last month, a court upheld a 10-year jail sentence for a prominent blogger.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The personal liability of financial services executives, including compliance leaders, has been a focus of several cases and regulatory initiatives this year, as the issue has taken hold in the United States.   U.S. regulators have fined or otherwise punished a number of corporate employees for misconduct while trying to bring clarity to how and when they will act, and why it is in a company\u2019s best interest to promptly cooperate with investigators after wrongdoing occurs.  Regulatory emphasis on the personal liability of individual corporate actors in both criminal and civil investigations should encourage executives, including compliance professionals, to use best practices for demonstrating their diligence in supervising staff and using sound judgment.   For compliance professionals, the avoidance of personal liability involves adopting techniques that showcase consistent monitoring and show how the compliance program is sound and appropriately configured for the firm.  PERSONAL LIABILITY AFTER YATES MEMO - AGENCY INITIATIVES  In 2015, Deputy Attorney General U.S. Sally Yates unveiled a memorandum(here) bearing her name and setting the course for the Justice Department's strategy on corporate prosecutions.   The memo announced a revised Department of Justice (DOJ) policy on targeting individuals within corporations during criminal or civil investigations. It states that federal prosecutors will give corporations \u201ccooperation credit\u201d only if they hand over all relevant information related to individuals responsible for potential misconduct.   It warns companies that the DOJ will focus on individual liability from the start of civil and criminal investigations and will not agree on a resolution with a corporation that provides immunity to culpable individuals.  The memo highlights accountability and deterrence while providing incentives for firms to take the reins in holding bad actors to account.   Incentives for employees themselves comes from the Dodd-Frank Act's whistleblower provisions(here) which encourage employees to report and help ferret out wrongdoing occurring in their businesses. The programs at the Securities and Exchange Commission and some other agencies allow whistleblowers to share in the financial penalties collected from successful enforcement actions that are assisted by their information; and the awards have been substantial.  Executives in the business \u2014 compliance included \u2014 should appreciate that an employee within the organization has the incentive to report any potentially wrongful behavior these executives are committing.  Another regulatory agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the primary federal regulator for most large banks, issued a new policy(here) on agency enforcement actions seeking civil money penalties against institutions and individuals.   Among other things, the OCC last February added a new aggravating factor to its enforcement policy by stating its intention to assess the \u201ceffectiveness of internal controls and compliance program\u201d and broadened the list of institution-affiliated parties from the typical list of directors, officers and controlling shareholders that could be subject to a penalty.   The list now includes any independent contractor or \u201cany other person\u201d who knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of law or regulation, breach of fiduciary duty, or unsafe or unsound practice. The harshest penalties are reserved for persons who show a deliberate or willful intent to violate a law or regulation; showing an attempt to comply can help scale down the civil money penalty.  Late last month, the DOJ announced its new Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) Corporate Enforcement Policy(here), which is intended to improve upon and make permanent the FCPA Pilot Program and applies to DOJ criminal prosecutions when a company voluntarily self-discloses misconduct, fully cooperates, and timely and appropriately remediates.   In so doing, the company will get the presumption of a declination unless there are aggravating factors, and even if the company does not make a voluntary disclosure, but meets the other requirements of the new policy, the business will still be eligible for cooperation credit of a 25 percent reduction off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.  The new policy is an effort by DOJ to incentivize companies to further disclose of their own accord and fully cooperate with respect to potential FCPA violations, plus another effort to bring criminal prosecutions in general against individual offenders.  At the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), its enforcement division issued its Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2017(here) that details its accomplishments and year-over-year comparisons, plus outlines an enforcement agenda for the coming year.  The report asserts that individual accountability deters wrongdoing and says the pursuit of such individuals must be the key of any effective enforcement program. It buttresses SEC Chairman Jay Clayton's statement(here) in his confirmation hearing earlier this year that \"individual liability is the greatest deterrent.\"  On the state level, New York's Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a powerful agency with regulatory jurisdiction over major international banks and insurers doing business in the state included significant executive liability measures in a directive(here) that took effect in March requiring firms to establish cyber-security programs.  The regulations require firms to designate a chief information security officer responsible for compliance with the directive. It also requires either the chairperson of the board or a senior officer to annually certify that firm\u2019s cyber-security program meets the regulator\u2019s requirements. Those submitting the certification can be held individually liable if the organization\u2019s cyber-security program is deficient and possibly assessed civil and criminal penalties.  The United States attention to individual liability is echoed in other countries, including the United Kingdom, whose measures reach beyond its borders.  Last year, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) implemented a strict accountability policy(here) called the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, whose implementation has been rolled out in waves, with all rules being in place by 2018.  It will impose liability on persons the FCA demonstrates were \u201cknowingly concerned\u201d with a breach by the firm. They will require senior persons to personally attest to the adequacy of compliance.  Those rules apply not only to UK banks but also to branches of foreign banks operating in the UK.  Barclays Capital in May had to pay penalties of more than $16.5 million as part of a U.S. settlement(here) stemming from allegations that the company did not properly supervise two of its former mortgage bond traders who allegedly lied to and overcharged clients.  According to the SEC, which brought the enforcement action, an investigation found that Yoon Seok Lee and David Wong, two former Barclays Capital residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) traders, made false or misleading statements to Barclays RMBS customers. These statements included false or misleading information about the price at which Barclays had bought the securities, the amount of profit Barclays was making for facilitating the trades, and who owned the securities. The SEC said the traders created a fictional third-party to create the appearance of price negotiations.  Additionally, the SEC investigation found that Lee and Wong added excessive mark-ups on certain transactions without notifying their customers.  The SEC investigation also found that Barclays \u201cfailed reasonably to supervise\u201d Lee and Wong by not implementing appropriate supervisory procedures that could have prevented or detected the false or misleading statements Lee and Wong made and could have prevented the overcharges.  Lee and Wong were charged individually, and both agreed to 12-month suspensions from working in the securities industry and payment of a fine.   Also in May, the U.S. Department of Treasury settled its case with Thomas Haider(here) the former chief compliance officers of MoneyGram international Inc. for what its financial crimes unit -- the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) -- called his significant failures to oversee an anti-money laundering (AML) program at his employer. The charges against Haider revolved around a \"failure to ensure an effective AML program.\"  FinCEN stressed the authority he had and failed to exert \u2014 from knowing of program deficiencies to failing to fire staff under his oversight who showed fraudulent behavior.  Haider agreed to a three-year injunction ban from serving in a compliance function at any money transmitter. He also agreed to pay a $250,000 penalty.  MoneyGram was also charged(here) in a Justice Department case. The company signed a deferred prosecution agreement in 2012 with the DOJ and was ordered to pay $100 million in penalties and restitution.  In another SEC case involving a chief compliance officer, David I. Osunkwo was charged with alleged reporting failures and misstatements.   The settlement was announced on August 15 and was based on events from 2009 to 2011 which ultimately resulted in an order(here) against not only Osunkwo but investment adviser Aegis Capital LLC and Circle One Wealth Management LLC, (two now defunct investment advisers) and their chief operating officer, Diane W. Lamm.   Osunkwo served in 2010 and 2011 as the compliance chief at Aegis Capital and Circle One Wealth Management. The firms had outsourced CCO duties to a third-party provider called Strategic Consulting Advisors, where Osunkwo was a principal.   Osunkwo was responsible for preparing a consolidated 2010 year-end Form ADV for Circle One that would reflect its merger with Aegis under the same parent company, Capital L Group LLC.  The SEC said in the settlement order that Osunkwo submitted inaccurate information for the two investment advisory companies, and Osunkwo listed the chief investment adviser as having certified the figures when, in fact, he had not.   The SEC held Osunkwo liable for the failings, fined him $30,000, and barred him from the securities industry for one year. Osunkwo, a New York-licensed attorney, did not admit or deny any wrongdoing. His company, Strategic Consulting Advisors, has closed, the SEC said.   Regulators are increasingly emphasizing the importance of individual liability at financial institutions, and holding individuals accountable for decisions they make that result in breaches of financial regulations.  This means that compliance officers should consider increasing and strictly organizing the evidence they maintain to show their monitoring and testing of compliance programs and controls. They should respond to all red flags of possible misconduct and thoroughly document their investigations or responses. Keeping a personal file to document all steps taken is one way to do so.  The compliance team must be prepared to show how they updated the company\u2019s compliance the program in light of organizational changes and new developments in applicable laws and regulations.  Particular attention must be given to reports of misconduct or whistleblower reports, and all relevant materials must be escalated to senior management such as the general counsel or board of directors.   The compliance department must detail how it investigated areas of potential non-compliance and developed corrective actions to rectify any misconduct and significant mistakes unearthed.  To define and limit supervisory liability, CCOs should also not have supervisory responsibilities over business-line activities. This should be made explicit when they assume the role, such as in an offer letter. Instead, an appropriate person in each area should perform supervisory responsibilities, and CCOs should meet regularly with these designated supervisors to verify whether proper oversight is taking place.   It is also essential that all appropriate staff members understand the accountability they bear in their specific roles. A compliance officer can be one of the persons in the organization to disseminate such information to encourage good behavior, whistleblower reporting, and detailed reporting of actions taken and decisions made.  Compliance officers must also escalate all material issues to senior management, including the board, or report them to regulators. CCOs should further request permission to obtain and document advice from independent outside legal counsel if there is a disagreement with senior management.  They also must speak up if they are working with insufficient resources, including headcount. This might mean appealing to the highest reaches of the organization, including the board of directors, using as examples the penalties and public relations pitfalls of peers in the industry and showcasing the benefits to the company\u2019s bottom line, reputation, and readiness to work anywhere in the world.  All managers in regulated firms must also appreciate any joint liability risks that could arise from the actions of affiliated entities, plus third-party vendors, and assess whether these parties are operating with quality systems, qualified personnel, and effective compliance programs.  Compliance departments should view regulatory cooperation credit policies as an attempt by the regulator to also essentially encourage self-reporting of violations.   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), another federal regulatory agency with a cooperation credit program, noted that such credit will not be given merely for following the law, but rather for what an individual or corporation \u201cvoluntarily does, beyond what it is required to do.\u201d  (Julie DiMauro is a regulatory intelligence expert in the Enterprise Risk Management division of Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department on Thursday will open up the largest area on record to offshore oil and gas drilling in a new five-year leasing plan, including previously protected parts of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans, sources familiar with the proposal said.  The move dovetails with President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to expand domestic energy production, but will come over the objections of environmentalists, state officials, and some business groups worried about spills and coastal tourism.  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke will unveil the updated National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program at 13:00 EST, the department said in a press release. It would replace the Obama administration\u2019s five-year leasing plan, and is expected to open up more areas to offshore drilling, including previously off-limits federal waters off the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific coasts.  Weeks before leaving office, former President Barack Obama had banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, protecting 115 million acres (46.5 million hectares) of waters off Alaska and 3.8 million acres in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay.  But Trump last April ordered the Interior Department to overhaul the existing offshore drilling plan.  In his executive order, Trump said it was U.S. policy to \u201cencourage energy exploration and production... in order to maintain the nation\u2019s position as a global energy leader and foster energy security and resilience for the benefit of the American people.\u201d  The proposal comes as low oil prices and soaring onshore production have curtailed industry demand for offshore leases, raising questions about the benefits of the move.  Ahead of Thursday\u2019s announcement, lawmakers from both parties, environmental groups, and local business leaders along the Atlantic coast said they are opposed to any effort to open up their coastlines to drilling rigs, citing environmental risks and threats to their lucrative tourism industries.  A spokesman for Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott said in a statement on Wednesday that he \u201cis aggressively fighting to protect Florida\u2019s environment by proposing more than $3.8 billion to preserve it.\u201d  Coastal tourism business groups are girding for a long fight against the Interior Department.  Frank Knapp, founder of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, accused the Interior Department of favoring the oil and gas sector over the tourism sector.  \u201cWhat part of the business sector are they listening to? It\u2019s certainly not small or coastal businesses whose livelihoods are dependent on healthy oceans,\u201d Knapp said. (Reporting By Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Nick Zieminski)"

The ADP National Employment Report showed that U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, marking the biggest monthly increase since March, and much above the 190,000 job additions forecast by economists polled by Reuters.  A more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday is expected to show the economy added 190,000 jobs in December, down from the 228,000 additions in November.  \u201cEconomic data tomorrow is not going to be tremendously spectacular, but what we\u2019re seeing is very positive growth, a good economic backdrop that gives people more confidence in corporate earnings,\u201d said Aaron Anderson, senior vice president of research at Fisher Investments.  The Federal Reserve affirming its view of gradual interest rate hikes this year in minutes released on Wednesday also supported the sentiment.  At 9:37 a.m. ET (1437 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 93.26 points, or 0.37 percent, at 25,015.94 and the S&P 500 was up 9.54 points, or 0.35 percent, at 2,722.6. The Nasdaq Composite was up 31.71 points, or 0.45 percent, at 7,097.24.  World stocks also hit records, driven by strong manufacturing and services sector data in major economies.  Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by gains in the financial index.  Wells Fargo rose about 2 percent, JPMorgan 1.3 percent and Goldman Sachs 1 percent, as the strong data raised the odds of further rate hikes.  Shares of department store operators J.C. Penney and Macy\u2019s were down more than 5 percent after the companies reported same-store sales during the key selling months of November and December.

          "title": "Suspected Russian jets kill 30 near Damascus",
          "body": "AMMAN (Reuters) - At least 30 civilians were killed early on Thursday when jets dropped bombs on a residential area in a besieged rebel enclave east of Syria\u2019s capital, a war monitor said, identifying the planes as Russian.  At least four bombs flattened two buildings in the Eastern Ghouta town of Misraba, in an attack that killed around 20 and wounded more than 40 people, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and civil defense sources said.  Elsewhere in Eastern Ghouta, the last major rebel enclave near Damascus, at least ten people were killed in aerial strikes in other nearby towns, the Observatory, rescuers and residents said.  The Observatory, a war monitor based in Britain, said 11 women and a child were among the dead in the strikes in Misraba, which it said were carried out by Russian planes.  Backed by Russian strikes, government forces have escalated military operations against Eastern Ghouta in recent months, seeking to tighten a siege that residents and aid workers say is a deliberate use of starvation as a weapon of war, a charge the government denies.  Russia rejects Syrian opposition and rights groups\u2019 accusations that its jets have been responsible for deaths of thousands of civilians since its major intervention two years ago that turned the tide in the country\u2019s nearly seven-year-old war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad.  Moscow says it only attacks hardline Islamists.  Video footage posted on Thursday by activists on social media in Eastern Ghouta showed rescue workers pulling women and children from rubble. The footage could not be independently confirmed.  Jets also pounded Harasta, on the western edge of the enclave, where rebels this week besieged and overran a major military base which residents say the army uses to pound residential areas.   The rebel assault aimed partly to relieve the pressure of the tightening siege.  The United Nations says about 400,000 civilians besieged in the area face \u201ccomplete catastrophe\u201d because aid deliveries by the government are blocked and hundreds of people who need urgent medical evacuation have not been allowed outside the enclave.  Scores of hospitals and civil defense centers in Ghouta and across Syria have been bombed during the conflict in what the opposition said is a \u201cscorched earth policy\u201d to paralyze life in rebel-held areas.  Syrian state news agency SANA said on Thursday rebel shelling of the government-held capital Damascus killed one and injured 22 in the Amara district of the city.   Supported by Iran-backed militias and intensive Russian bombing, the Syrian army has since last month waged a new campaign to push into the heart of another rebel-held part of Syria, Idlib province in the country\u2019s northwest.  Idlib is a heavily populated area where over two million people live.  Rescue workers said there had been a spike in civilian casualties there in the last twenty days from stepped-up aerial strikes on residential areas, documenting 50 dead at least in that period.  \u201cThere have been at least six major massacres perpetrated by Russia in indiscriminate bombing of cities and towns with thousands fleeing their homes in the last two weeks,\u201d said Mustafa al Haj Yousef, the head of Idlib\u2019s Civil Defence, rescuers who work in opposition-held areas.   On Wednesday air strikes hit a maternity hospital\u00a0in Idlib\u2019s Ma\u2019arat al-Nu\u2019man city, killing five people, the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) charity, which supports the hospital, said.  The hospital, which SAMS said delivers around 30 babies a day, had been struck three times in four days and the last strikes temporarily put the hospital out of service.      Overnight, a family of seven was buried under rubble in Tel Dukan village, rescuers said.  The army has been gaining ground in Idlib and the adjoining eastern Hama countryside, with scores of villages seized from rebels mainly belonging to Tahrir al Sham, a coalition of jihadist groups with mainstream Free Syrian Army (FSA) factions also engaged in the battles.

          "title": "Fidelity retirement funds take multiyear hit from commodities bet",
          "body": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments\u2019 bet on commodities for its flagship retirement funds has declined 38 percent over the past five years, while top rivals have avoided the sector altogether or made money with more-conservative strategies.  The Boston-based company inserted its new Fidelity Series Commodity Strategy Fund into its Freedom Funds in 2009 to diversify their portfolios from stocks and bonds while giving them a weapon against inflation. But U.S. inflation has been weak for years, while stocks have been surging.  Realized losses in the Commodity Strategy Fund have totaled $3.26 billion since 2012, according to its financial statements. In that time, energy prices collapsed, gold and silver prices declined, and bouts of excess supply plagued the coffee and sugar markets, according to Fidelity\u2019s disclosures.  The fund invests in futures contracts that cover commodities such as hogs, oil and wheat, as well as swaps with counterparties such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, according to U.S. regulatory filings.     Even with the commodity funds\u2019 losses, returns for Freedom Funds, which dial down risk as investors approach their estimated target date for retirement, exceeded those of more than 90 percent of peers because of larger, winning bets on stocks, according to three-year performance data from research firm Morningstar Inc.   Fidelity\u2019s allocation to commodities in the Freedom Funds is $4 billion, or nearly 2 percent of $224 billion in net assets. That is down from highs of $12 billion and up to 10 percent of assets in some of the most aggressive Freedom Fund portfolios in 2013.  Morningstar analyst Jeff Holt said some managers of target-date retirement funds had lost patience with their commodities bets.   \u201cWe\u2019re in a multiyear bull market for equities, and diversification from that doesn\u2019t look that great,\u201d Holt said.  Fidelity said in a statement that it was sticking with its commodities strategy as its portfolio managers take a long-term view.  \u201cThe target date team has confidence in all of the investment strategies that are included in the portfolios,\u201d the company said.  And the tide could be turning for commodities. The commodity fund eked out a 0.92 percent gain in 2017 as energy prices rallied during the second half of the year. Oil rose to its highest since May 2015 on Thursday, helped by large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded as high as $68.27.  Unlike Fidelity, target-date portfolios managed by T. Rowe Price Group Inc use a fund with no direct exposure to commodities. Instead of investing in futures contracts like the Fidelity commodity fund does, T. Rowe primarily buys shares of publicly traded companies that own or are involved in natural resources, precious metals or real estate, spokesman Bill Weeks said.   The surging stock market is one reason why the $3.3 billion T. Rowe Real Assets Fund has generated an average annual return of 3.07 percent over the past five years, compared with average annual losses of 9.07 percent for Fidelity\u2019s commodity fund, according to Morningstar.   Vanguard Group, the largest target-date fund provider, does not invest in commodities for those retirement portfolios. The increased costs and complexity associated with commodities outweigh their benefits, said Senior Investment Analyst Scott Donaldson.  \u201cPeople may think because they own commodities, they own barrels of oil and bushels of wheat,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cBut what they really own are financial derivatives. These can be complex, confusing and expensive.\u201d     Reporting by Tim McLaughlin; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn"

          "body": "PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech Finance Ministry said it proposes to give up a European Union subsidy for a project at the center of a police investigation that has hurt the minority government\u2019s chances of winning a parliamentary confidence vote.   The two million euro subsidy was awarded in 2008 to a farm and conference center now owned by Agrofert, the biggest Czech private employer created by then businessman Andrej Babis and owned by him until he moved it to a trust fund last year.  The project called Stork Nest is at the center of allegations that Babis, appointed prime minister after his party won an election in October last year, manipulated ownership of the project to win funding he was not entitled to.  The scandal is the chief reason why other political parties have refused to join Babis\u2019s ANO party in a coalition and why a minority cabinet led by Babis is expected to lose a parliamentary confidence vote planned for next week.  Babis denies any wrongdoing and says the case is a fabrication by opponents fearing his anti-corruption drive.  The case has been investigated by Czech police, who have charged Babis and others with fraud in the case, and by the EU\u2019s anti-fraud body OLAF.  The ministry released three paragraphs of the OLAF report, which said that the EU watchdog found \u201cirregularities\u201d in the Stork Nest project and proposed to exclude the subsidy from EU funding. It did not provide any details and said the full 48-page report could not be released due to pending investigations.  In a separate statement on Thursday, the ministry said its recommendation to regional authorities in charge of managing EU subsidies followed a letter from the European Commission which recommended taking back requests to fund a number of projects under criminal investigation or investigation by OLAF.   \u201cThe European Commission...proposed to take out expenditure that is subject to administrative or criminal proceedings or proceedings by OLAF from European funding,\u201d the ministry said.  \u201cThe ministry therefore today turned to (regional administrators) and the Environment Ministry with a proposal to accept the European Commission letter.\u201d   Babis and his spokespersons were not immediately available for comment.  Stork Nest, a conference center and a farm outside Prague, had undisclosed owners when it requested the subsidy. The funding, made under the EU\u2019s program for poorer EU regions, was meant for small business and Babis\u2019s Agrofert would not qualify. It was however owned by Agrofert entities earlier and is now owned by Agrofert again.  Babis has been charged with subsidy fraud in the case but won parliamentary immunity in the election. The lower house is expected to vote on lifting his immunity in the coming weeks.  It is up to regional Czech authorities to decide on the European Commission and the Finance Ministry recommendation. Officials there were not immediately available for comment.  Reporting by Robert Muller and Jan Lopatka, Editing by William Maclean"

          "body": "(Adds details on glyphosate pricing,)  Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. seeds and agrochemicals company Monsanto Co forecast a strong year ahead, helped by higher pricing for a key chemical used in pesticides and better demand for Soybean globally.  The company, which is being acquired by Germany\u2019s Bayer AG , said pricing for glyphosate, the chief ingredient in its top-selling weed killer \u201cRoundup\u201d, was set to go up this year.  The results come a day after Monsanto won support from 11 U.S. states in its attempt to stop California from requiring cancer warnings on products containing glyphosate.  Monsanto said on Thursday that sales at its agricultural unit - its second biggest by revenue -  rose 11 percent, mainly helped by glyphosate pricing.  Sales of soybean seeds jumped 21.3 percent to $728 million, lifting overall net sales marginally to $2.66 billion in the first quarter.  Monsanto is banking on newer varieties of seeds to dominate soybean production in the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest exporter.  Net profit attributable to Monsanto rose to $169 million, or 38 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Nov. 30, from $29 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a one-time gain from asset sales.  The company\u2019s shares were up 0.5 percent at $118 in early trading on Thursday.

The proposal for the amendment came after a sharp rise in shares of Blockchain Mining (BLCM.TA), a company that said it would shift its focus from mining for gold and iron to mining crypto currencies.   \u201cThis phenomenon, if it continues, may in the future have serious consequences on the ... fairness of trading in the bourse in general and on investor confidence in the bourse,\u201d the ISA said.  Share prices of companies intending to operate in the sector are cut off from their real value, the ISA said, and \u201cthe market treats their shares irrationally and unexpectedly.\u201d  Last month, outgoing ISA chairman Shmuel Hauser said he planned to bring such a proposal up, saying bitcoin prices were behaving like a bubble.  The value of a bitcoin, the biggest and best-known  cryptocurrency, surged in mid-December to nearly $20,000, then dropped to less than $12,000 at the end of the month. It was trading today around $14,500.  Bitcoin is a publicly available ledger of a finite number of digital \u201ccoins\u201d, which backers say can be used as a currency without the support of any country\u2019s central bank. It is \u201cmined\u201d  by computers, which are awarded new coins for working out complex mathematical formulas. Several other cryptocurrencies have also been launched that work on similar principles.  ($1 = 3.4453 shekels)  Reporting by Steven Scheer, editing by Larry King"

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.  Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Beggars need to be cleared by police from the streets of Windsor before the wedding of Prince Harry to girlfriend Meghan Markle because their \u201cdetritus\u201d is presenting the picturesque English town in a poor light, the local council leader has said.  Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson Harry and his American actress fiancee are to tie the knot at Windsor Castle, the monarch\u2019s palace to the west of London, in May with thousands of visitors expected to visit the town to celebrate the occasion.  Simon Dudley, the leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead council, wrote on Twitter there had been an \u201cepidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy\u201d in the town and said he wanted police \u201cto focus on dealing with this before the #RoyalWedding\u201d.  \u201cThis is creating a concerning and hostile atmosphere for our residents and the seven million tourists who come to Windsor each year,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the local Police and Crime Commissioner Anthony Stansfield.  \u201cIt is becoming increasingly concerning to see the quantities of bags and detritus that those begging are accumulating and leaving on our pavements, at times unattended, thus presenting a security risk.\u201d  His remarks drew criticism from local homeless organizations and even Prime Minister Theresa May.  \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the comments that the leader of the council has made,\u201d she told BBC TV.  \u201cI think it is important that we, councils, work hard to ensure that they are proving accommodation for those people who are homeless, and where there are issues of people aggressively begging on the streets then it\u2019s important that councils work with the police to deal with that aggressive bullying.\u201d  Windsor, the oldest inhabited castle in the world which has been a home of British monarchs for almost 1,000 years, attracts 1.3 million visitors every year, while many also visit the town to watch the regular \u201cChanging the Guard\u201d ceremony with soldiers in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats parading with an army band.  Dudley said the council had invested heavily in support services to help those in need with shelters and emergency accommodation for rough sleepers, adding there was evidence that many of those begging were not in fact homeless.  \u201cObviously, the level of tourist interest is set to multiply with the Royal Wedding in May 2018,\u201d he wrote, calling for the police to invoke powers such as the 1824 Vagrancy Act to clear the streets. \u201cThe whole situation also presents a beautiful town in a sadly unfavorable light.\u201d  Stansfield said he was surprised the letter had been publicly released, but added the police would be happy to investigate Dudley\u2019s concerns.  The Windsor Homelessness Project\u2019s manager Murphy James told the BBC it was \u201csickening\u201d Dudley had cited the royal wedding as a reason for concern.  \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely abhorrent that anybody has got these views in this day and age, especially a lead councillor of the borough,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody is sleeping out on the street, they are not there by choice, they are there because something has gone wrong.\u201d  Editing by Stephen Addison"

Athens has blocked the ex-Yugoslav republic\u2019s attempts to join NATO and objects to its EU membership bid because it says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over Greece\u2019s own northerly region of that name.  \u201cI think 2018 will be the year when foreign policy issues that have been stuck in the mud for decades will be resolved,\u201d Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias told reporters after a meeting of the inner cabinet.  \u201cWe will all contribute to the wellbeing of all the Balkans,\u201d he said.  The small ex-Yugoslav republic of about 2 million people declared independence in 1991, avoiding the violence that accompanied much of the breakup of Yugoslavia.  But Greece is withholding support for Macedonia\u2019s further integration into international bodies, including NATO, until it agrees to change its name.  Athens has only agreed that the country can be referred to in international venues as the \u201cFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, as an interim measure until the dispute is resolved.  \u201cOn the name issue, the government is negotiating and supports a compound name that will be comprehensively used throughout,\u201d Kotzias said on Thursday, without elaborating.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 4 (IFR) - Daimler, this year\u2019s third auto credit, priced a \u20ac750m five-year floater through its curve on Thursday as investors scrambled to get their hands on the little corporate supply coming to market this week.  The company started marketing an expected \u20ac500m five-year at 30bp area over Euribor, before launching an increased \u20ac750m at a discount margin of 25bp on books of over \u20ac1bn.  At that level IFR calculations show the deal coming slightly inside fair value, which was around 26.5bp using bid-side quotes on Daimler\u2019s May 2022 and July 2024 floaters.  In comparison, BMW, which sold a \u20ac2bn dual-trancher on Wednesday, offered premiums of 3bp-4bp on its 5.5-year and 3bp on the 10s.  A banker away estimated a similar fair value number of plus 27bp, although both were some way wide of the official 20bp-25bp range.  Daimler, rated A2/A/A- (all stable), issued the paper through sole lead UniCredit.  The frequent borrower followed in the footsteps of RCI Banque\u2019s \u20ac750m five-floater on Wednesday. That came at 43bp over Euribor with a concession of around 2bp.  RCI and BMW have held up well in the secondary market. RCI was quoted at 39bp, while BMW\u2019s shorter bond was at swaps plus 11.8bp, essentially flat to the 12bp reoffer, and the longer deal nearly 3.5bp tighter at swaps plus 21.6bp.  \u201cThe fact that supply is fairly low this week is down to a lack of issuers rather than appetite,\u201d the banker away said.  \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of pre-funding in November and December, and the market remains strong as exemplified by investors\u2019 response.\u201d  * Final terms: \u20ac750m at DM+25.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drone sales in 2017 topped $1 billion for the first time ever, but don\u2019t raise a glass too quickly if you are in New Jersey, where lawmakers are poised to outlaw drunken droning next week.  It is one of a wave of U.S. states moving to bring the unmanned aircrafts\u2019 high-flying fun back to earth.  New Jersey\u2019s Assembly is slated to vote on a bill approved by the state Senate to ban inebriated or drugged droning, as well as to outlaw flying unmanned aircraft systems over prisons and in pursuit of wildlife. The vote was set for Thursday but postponed until Monday because of a severe snowstorm that triggered a state of emergency in New Jersey.   \u201cIt\u2019s basically like flying a blender,\u201d said John Sullivan, 41, of New York, a drone buff and aerial cinematographer. He said he opposed drunk droning but also fretted about regulatory overreach. \u201cIf I had like one drink, I\u2019d be hesitant to even fly it.\u201d  A 2015 drone crash on the White House lawn fueled debate in the U.S. Congress over the need for drone regulations.  It was a drunken, off-duty employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency who flew the 2-foot-by-2-foot (60 cm by 60 cm) \u201cquadcopter\u201d from a friend\u2019s apartment balcony and lost control of it over the grounds surrounding the White House, the New York Times reported.  New statistics set for release next week show 3.1 million drones were sold in the United States last year, up 28 percent from 2016, said Richard Kowalski, manager for the Consumer Technology Association.   \u201cThis was the first year that drone revenues reached $1 billion,\u201d Kowalksi said in an email.  At least 38 states are considering restrictions on the devices this legislative year, including Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina, said Amanda Essex, senior policy specialist for the National Conference of State Legislatures.  \u201cLike any technology, drones have the ability to be used for good, but they also provide new opportunities for bad actors,\u201d said Assemblywoman Annette Quijano of Elizabeth, New Jersey. She backed the bill, which would impose a punishment of up to six months prison and a $1,000 fine for drunk droning.  If the Assembly passes the bill, Governor Chris Christie must sign it into law before he leaves office in less than two weeks or the legislation is dead, said Quijano\u2019s Chief of Staff Shane Derris.  Already, nine states prohibit drones from operating near or over prisons, including Arizona, Louisiana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin, Essex said.  A drone carrying wire cutters and a cell phone likely aided a prisoner\u2019s escape in July from a maximum security prison in South Carolina, officials said.

          "title": "Fidelity retirement funds take multiyear hit from commodities bet",
          "body": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments\u2019 bet on commodities for its flagship retirement funds has declined 38 percent over the past five years, while top rivals have avoided the sector altogether or made money with more-conservative strategies.  The Boston-based company inserted its new Fidelity Series Commodity Strategy Fund into its Freedom Funds in 2009 to diversify their portfolios from stocks and bonds while giving them a weapon against inflation. But U.S. inflation has been weak for years, while stocks have been surging.  Realized losses in the Commodity Strategy Fund have totaled $3.26 billion since 2012, according to its financial statements. In that time, energy prices collapsed, gold and silver prices declined, and bouts of excess supply plagued the coffee and sugar markets, according to Fidelity\u2019s disclosures.  The fund invests in futures contracts that cover commodities such as hogs, oil and wheat, as well as swaps with counterparties such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, according to U.S. regulatory filings.     Even with the commodity funds\u2019 losses, returns for Freedom Funds, which dial down risk as investors approach their estimated target date for retirement, exceeded those of more than 90 percent of peers because of larger, winning bets on stocks, according to three-year performance data from research firm Morningstar Inc.   Fidelity\u2019s allocation to commodities in the Freedom Funds is $4 billion, or nearly 2 percent of $224 billion in net assets. That is down from highs of $12 billion and up to 10 percent of assets in some of the most aggressive Freedom Fund portfolios in 2013.  Morningstar analyst Jeff Holt said some managers of target-date retirement funds had lost patience with their commodities bets.   \u201cWe\u2019re in a multiyear bull market for equities, and diversification from that doesn\u2019t look that great,\u201d Holt said.  Fidelity said in a statement that it was sticking with its commodities strategy as its portfolio managers take a long-term view.  \u201cThe target date team has confidence in all of the investment strategies that are included in the portfolios,\u201d the company said.  And the tide could be turning for commodities. The commodity fund eked out a 0.92 percent gain in 2017 as energy prices rallied during the second half of the year. Oil rose to its highest since May 2015 on Thursday, helped by large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded as high as $68.27.  Unlike Fidelity, target-date portfolios managed by T. Rowe Price Group Inc use a fund with no direct exposure to commodities. Instead of investing in futures contracts like the Fidelity commodity fund does, T. Rowe primarily buys shares of publicly traded companies that own or are involved in natural resources, precious metals or real estate, spokesman Bill Weeks said.   The surging stock market is one reason why the $3.3 billion T. Rowe Real Assets Fund has generated an average annual return of 3.07 percent over the past five years, compared with average annual losses of 9.07 percent for Fidelity\u2019s commodity fund, according to Morningstar.   Vanguard Group, the largest target-date fund provider, does not invest in commodities for those retirement portfolios. The increased costs and complexity associated with commodities outweigh their benefits, said Senior Investment Analyst Scott Donaldson.  \u201cPeople may think because they own commodities, they own barrels of oil and bushels of wheat,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cBut what they really own are financial derivatives. These can be complex, confusing and expensive.\u201d     Reporting by Tim McLaughlin; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn"

          "body": "BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s Continental (CONG.DE) and Bosch [ROBG.UL], the world\u2019s largest automotive suppliers, have each bought a 5 percent stake in digital mapping firm HERE, as the industry pools resources with major carmakers to develop self-driving cars.

Chip maker Intel (INTC.O) also holds a 15 percent stake in HERE.  Continental and privately owned Bosch said separately they wanted to advance their expertise in driver-assistance and other data-based technologies.

          "title": "Trump threatens ex-ally Bannon with legal action amid book fallout",
          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened former chief strategist Steve Bannon with legal action over \u201cdefamatory\u201d statements about Trump\u2019s son and son-in-law over a meeting with Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.  Trump cut ties with Bannon on Wednesday, saying his former adviser had \u201clost his mind\u201d in a blistering statement issued after reports of disparaging comments by Bannon in a forthcoming book, \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff.  In the book, Bannon described a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d The meeting, held after the Russians promised damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, was attended by Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was the campaign manager at the time.  Lawyers for the president sent a cease-and-desist letter to Bannon on Wednesday. They said in the letter, seen by Reuters, Bannon had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump, his family and the campaign and made disparaging remarks about Trump and his family.  Trump personal lawyer Charles Harder said in a statement, \u201cLegal action is imminent,\u201d according to media reports.  It was not clear if Trump\u2019s lawyers also would pursue legal action against author Wolff, whose book offered a lacerating portrait of an accidental presidency in a dysfunctional White House.  On Thursday, the White House said no personal devices, including cell phones, would be allowed in the West Wing beginning next week for security purposes. The moves followed the Bannon split but had been considered for some time.  Trump had relied heavily on Bannon, chairman of the right-wing Breitbart News website, for advice in the months leading up to his upset victory in the November 2016 election. He then gave Bannon a strategic role in the White House, where he became a divisive figure before being fired in August. Bannon returned to Breitbart and reportedly continued to talk regularly with Trump.  He declined to comment to Reuters on Trump\u2019s statement, which also diminished Bannon\u2019s role in the election victory and accused him of leaking to the media.  Bannon helped Trump shape a populist, anti-establishment message and had been the president\u2019s link to his conservative base of support. It was not clear if the split would push Bannon to be even more aggressive in his campaign against the Republican establishment, whether he would now target Trump or would emerge much weaker.  On Thursday, Bannon told a caller on Breitbart News radio that \u201cnothing will ever come between us and President Trump and his agenda,\u201d according to CNN.  The story that triggered the Trump-Bannon split was an offshoot of the investigation into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia to sway the election to Trump - allegations Trump and Moscow deny.  According to the book, which is due out on Tuesday, Bannon expressed derision about the June 2016 meeting in which a Russian lawyer offered damaging information about Clinton. Bannon also was quoted as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians to meet his father in Trump Tower.  In the book, Bannon also said he believed the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow will focus on money laundering.  Special counsel Robert Mueller, who leads the Russia investigation, has asked White House officials to preserve records of the Trump Tower meeting, according to a source with knowledge of the request.  Manafort and business associate Rick Gates, another campaign aide, pleaded not guilty in November to federal charges brought by Mueller including conspiracy to launder money.  Manafort sued Mueller on Wednesday, alleging that his investigation exceeds its legal authority. (Reporting by Steve Holland and Jim Oliphant; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bill Trott)"

          "title": "Catalan separatist Junqueras seeks release from detention",
          "body": "MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan separatist Oriol Junqueras appeared in court on Thursday to ask for his release after more than two months in detention for his role in the Spanish region\u2019s illegal push for independence.  State prosecutors asked the Supreme Court to keep Junqueras in Estremera prison, outside Madrid, court officials said, which would prevent him from swearing in at the opening session of the new Catalan parliament on Jan. 17.  A Dec. 21 regional election gave separatists a slim majority in the parliament in a blow to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had hoped it would quash the Catalan independence movement and resolve Spain\u2019s worst political crisis in decades.  Junqueras\u2019s Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left) party emerged as the second largest separatist group, a few seats behind former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont\u2019s Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) party.  Market-friendly party Ciudadanos (Citizens) won the most seats but other unionist parties did not secure enough votes to form a majority.  Puigdemont remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels, though he has said he would return to Catalonia if the Spanish government gave him certain \u201cguarantees\u201d, likely a promise not to arrest him.  Esquerra lawmakers have said Puigdemont has the right to again be Catalan president, but if he is unable to return from Brussels he should step aside for Junqueras. Esquerra and Junts per Catalunya, along with a smaller separatist party, have not yet agreed on a coalition.  Junqueras said at the Thursday hearing he was a \u201cman of peace\u201d and of \u201cdialogue,\u201d his lawyer Andreu Van Den Eynde told reporters outside the courthouse. He is in custody on allegations of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.  The court said it would not reach a decision on Thursday.  Rajoy fired both Junqueras and Puigdemont when he imposed direct control over Catalonia after the separatist-controlled government declared independence following an Oct. 1 referendum on secession from Spain, which courts ruled illegal.  The political instability in Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain\u2019s economy, has deterred tourists and prompted more than 3,000 companies, including the region\u2019s two biggest banks, to move their legal headquarters elsewhere in Spain.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump blasted former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon on Wednesday as having \u201clost his mind\u201d in the fallout over damaging comments Bannon made about Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. in excerpts from a new book.  Trump, who had continued to speak privately with Bannon after firing him in August, essentially cut ties with his former aide at least for now in a blistering statement issued after Bannon\u2019s comments came to light.  \u201cSteve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,\u201d Trump said.  Trump had relied heavily on Bannon, chairman of the right-wing Breitbart News website, for advice in the months leading up to his upset victory in the November 2016 election.   Bannon helped Trump shape a populist, anti-establishment message and has been the president\u2019s link to his conservative base of support. It was not clear if the split would push Bannon to be even more aggressive in his campaign against the Republican establishment and whether he would now also target Trump, or would emerge much weaker.  According to excerpts from \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff, to be released on Tuesday, Bannon described a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d The meeting was arranged by the president\u2019s son and attended by top Trump campaign officials.  Trump has in the past praised Bannon for his friendship, but the president said in his statement on Wednesday Bannon had little to do with his election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, calling him \u201ca staffer who worked for me\u201d after he had already won the Republican nomination.  The president said Bannon was to blame for the loss of a Republican-held U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in December when Republican Roy Moore, whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, lost to Democrat Doug Jones. Trump and Bannon backed Moore in the campaign.   \u201cNow that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn\u2019t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,\u201d Trump said.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had been upset over Trump\u2019s backing of Moore at the urging of Bannon, was clearly pleased Trump was willing to rid himself of the former aide. McConnell\u2019s campaign organization posted on Twitter an image of the normally taciturn senator with a beaming smile.  Donald Trump Jr. attacked Bannon in a tweet.  \u201cSteve had the honor of working in the White House & serving the country. Unfortunately, he squandered that privilege & turned that opportunity into a nightmare of backstabbing, harassing, leaking, lying & undermining the President. Steve is not a strategist, he is an opportunist,\u201d he said.  The president, an expert at self-promotion, said Bannon was trying to promote himself by \u201cleaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was.\u201d  \u201cSteve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books,\u201d said Trump, who famously values loyalty in associates and employees.  Lawyers for the president sent a cease and desist letter to Bannon on Wednesday. They said in the letter, seen by Reuters, Bannon had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump, his family members and the campaign and made disparaging remarks about Trump and his family.  With elections looming in November that could cost Republicans control of Congress, Trump praised Republican lawmakers and candidates, words likely to be welcomed by McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan.  \u201cLike me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down,\u201d Trump said.  As with much in the Trump White House, the story that triggered the harsh back-and-forth was an offshoot of the investigation into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia to sway the election to Trump, allegations Trump and Moscow deny.  Bannon expressed derision about the June 2016 meeting in which a Russian lawyer was said to have offered damaging information about Clinton, according to the book.  The meeting was attended by Trump\u2019s son, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Bannon was also quoted as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians who took part in the meeting to meet his father in Trump Tower.   \u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers,\u201d Bannon said in the book in excerpts seen by Reuters.  \u201cEven if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately,\u201d he said.  When an intermediary proposed the meeting, saying the Russians were offering damaging information about Clinton, Trump Jr. responded in an email: \u201cI love it.\u201d  Bannon was incredulous about the meeting shortly after it was revealed, according to the book, concluding sarcastically: \u201cThat\u2019s the brain trust they had.\u201d  The Wolff book, parts of which were published by New York magazine, portrayed Trump as shocked that he won the election and said his wife, Melania Trump, was in tears, and \u201cnot of joy.\u201d  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called the book \u201ctrashy tabloid fiction.\u201d  The first lady\u2019s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said: \u201cThe book is clearly going to be sold in the bargain fiction section. Mrs. Trump supported her husband\u2019s decision to run for President and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did.\u201d  Reporting by Steve Holland; Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, Jim Oliphant and Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Will Dunham, Peter Cooney and Paul Tait"

Footage from television news showed fire engulfing one of the train\u2019s carriages after the accident, which occurred as it traveled between Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg.  Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi said the train, which was carrying 700 passengers, jumped the tracks after hitting the truck, which was attempting to negotiate a level crossing.  He said preliminary investigations suggested 12 people had died in the crash and 268 were injured, including four critically.  Emergency services said 14 people had died, and dozens were hurt, calling the minister\u2019s injury estimate premature.  \u201cI have been briefed that the accident was the result of a truck that was driving through a level crossing...

Emergency services and rail officials were not immediately able to confirm the circumstances of the crash.  South Africa has the continent\u2019s largest railway network, but it has been plagued by mismanagement and under-investment that has seen train use dwindle despite it being the cheapest from of public transportation.

The Federal Court of Justice, rejected an appeal filed to a lower court by the transsexual woman who wanted to be registered as a second mother of the child, born in 2015. It said only the woman who gives birth can be considered the child\u2019s legal mother.  In September, the court made a similar ruling in a case concerning a transsexual man who gave birth to a baby and wanted to be registered as the legal father.  The court said in its ruling on Thursday that although the rights and duties of a transsexual person depended on their new gender, the legal relationship with his or her children remained unchanged.  In November, Germany\u2019s constitutional court ruled in favor of the introduction of a third gender category for people who do not identify as either male or female or are born with an ambiguous sexual anatomy.

The Dec. 15 death of Ibrahim Abu Thurayeh was denounced by the Palestinians and decried by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, who said the a 29-year-old amputee was shot in the head by Israeli troops close to the Gaza-Israel border fence.  The Israeli military said its own operational investigation, carried out shortly after the incident, had found that it was not possible to say what had killed Abu Thurayeh. It said no live fire had been directed at him during the dispersal of the demonstration, in which protesters hurled explosive devices and rocks and set tires alight.    \u201cIn order to further examine the case, including information received from organizations operating in the Gaza Strip, it was decided that the circumstances of Thurayeh\u2019s death will also be examined by a Military Police investigation,\u201d the army said in a statement.  Trump\u2019s announcement on Jerusalem infuriated the Arab world and upset Western allies. It has sparked violent protests on a weekly basis along the Israel-Gaza border and in the occupied West Bank.  Abu Thurayeh was a regular at such demonstrations. In media interviews, he had said he had lost both his legs in a 2008 Israeli missile strike in Gaza.  The status of Jerusalem has been one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians for generations.  Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital. Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital of a future independent state of their own.  Reporting by Maayan Lubell; Editing by Catherine Evans"

          "body": "(Changes source, adds reaction, background)  DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, Jan 4 (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Thursday sentenced a lawmaker of the main pro-Kurdish opposition party to 16 years and 8 months in prison, courthouse sources said, nearly a year after his arrest on terrorism-related charges.  Idris Baluken, of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP), was first jailed pending trial in a terrorism-related investigation in November 2016. He was later released in January 2017 and arrested again one month later.  Baluken and other detained HDP members, including the party\u2019s co-leaders, are mostly accused of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, which has conducted a decades-old insurgency against the Turkish state. All of the accused have denied the charges.  \u201cThis sentence reflects anger against democracy and the fight for freedom. Justice is being used as a baton,\u201d said HDP co-leader Serpil Kemalbay following the court ruling.  The arrests in the HDP drew international condemnation and former co-leader Figen Yuksekdag has since been stripped of her parliamentary status and replaced as co-chairwoman.  \u201cDevastating sentence and continuation of crackdown on opposition voices,\u201d the European Parliament\u2019s rapporteur on Turkey, Kati Piri, wrote on Twitter.  The third-largest party in the Turkish parliament, the HDP has been hammered by a crackdown that followed the July 2016 coup attempt, as several of its members have either been detained, jailed or stripped of their parliamentary status.  About 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended and roughly 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial since the failed coup. The HDP says as many as 5,000 of its members have been detained.  Rights groups and Turkey\u2019s Western allies say President Tayyip Erdogan has used the putsch as an excuse to quash dissent, but the government argues the purges are necessary to thwart mounting threats.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Beggars need to be cleared by police from the streets of Windsor before the wedding of Prince Harry to girlfriend Meghan Markle because their \u201cdetritus\u201d is presenting the picturesque English town in a poor light, the local council leader has said.  Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson Harry and his American actress fiancee are to tie the knot at Windsor Castle, the monarch\u2019s palace to the west of London, in May with thousands of visitors expected to visit the town to celebrate the occasion.  Simon Dudley, the leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead council, wrote on Twitter there had been an \u201cepidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy\u201d in the town and said he wanted police \u201cto focus on dealing with this before the #RoyalWedding\u201d.  \u201cThis is creating a concerning and hostile atmosphere for our residents and the seven million tourists who come to Windsor each year,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the local Police and Crime Commissioner Anthony Stansfield.  \u201cIt is becoming increasingly concerning to see the quantities of bags and detritus that those begging are accumulating and leaving on our pavements, at times unattended, thus presenting a security risk.\u201d  His remarks drew criticism from local homeless organizations and even Prime Minister Theresa May.  \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the comments that the leader of the council has made,\u201d she told BBC TV.  \u201cI think it is important that we, councils, work hard to ensure that they are proving accommodation for those people who are homeless, and where there are issues of people aggressively begging on the streets then it\u2019s important that councils work with the police to deal with that aggressive bullying.\u201d  Windsor, the oldest inhabited castle in the world which has been a home of British monarchs for almost 1,000 years, attracts 1.3 million visitors every year, while many also visit the town to watch the regular \u201cChanging the Guard\u201d ceremony with soldiers in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats parading with an army band.  Dudley said the council had invested heavily in support services to help those in need with shelters and emergency accommodation for rough sleepers, adding there was evidence that many of those begging were not in fact homeless.  \u201cObviously, the level of tourist interest is set to multiply with the Royal Wedding in May 2018,\u201d he wrote, calling for the police to invoke powers such as the 1824 Vagrancy Act to clear the streets. \u201cThe whole situation also presents a beautiful town in a sadly unfavorable light.\u201d  Stansfield said he was surprised the letter had been publicly released, but added the police would be happy to investigate Dudley\u2019s concerns.  The Windsor Homelessness Project\u2019s manager Murphy James told the BBC it was \u201csickening\u201d Dudley had cited the royal wedding as a reason for concern.  \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely abhorrent that anybody has got these views in this day and age, especially a lead councillor of the borough,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody is sleeping out on the street, they are not there by choice, they are there because something has gone wrong.\u201d  Editing by Stephen Addison"

Penney rises 1.35 pct on robust holiday sales  * Futures up: Dow 100 pts, S&P 7.5 pts, Nasdaq 30.75 pts (Adds comment, updates prices, details on ADP employment report)  By Sruthi Shankar  Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to breach 25,000-mark for the first time on Thursday, close on the heels of records for the other major indexes earlier this week, as strong U.S. private hiring data added to investor optimism.  Dow futures were trading 23 points short of the milestone. The blue-chip index crossed 20,000 in early 2017, spurred by President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda.  \u201cWe\u2019re going through these milestone numbers more quickly but they have been steady and positive,\u201d said Aaron Anderson, senior vice president of research at Fisher Investments.  The ADP National Employment Report showed that U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, marking the biggest monthly increase since March, and much above the 190,000 job additions forecast by economists polled by Reuters.  A more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday is expected to show the economy added 190,000 jobs in December, down from the 228,000 additions in November.  \u201cEconomic data tomorrow is not going to be tremendously spectacular, but what we\u2019re seeing is very positive growth, a good economic backdrop that gives people more confidence in corporate earnings,\u201d Anderson said.  World stocks hit records on Thursday, driven by strong manufacturing and services sector data in major economies and the Federal Reserve affirming its view of gradual interest rate hikes this year.  At 8:29 a.m. ET (1329 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 100 points, or 0.4 percent, with 21,967 contracts changing hands.  S&P 500 e-minis were up 7.5 points, or 0.28 percent, with 125,598 contracts traded.  Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 30.75 points, or 0.47 percent, on volume of 27,579 contracts.  The S&P closed above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settled above 7,000 a day earlier.  Oil rose further above $68 a barrel to the highest since May 2015, supported by unrest in Iran, cold weather in the United States boosting demand and OPEC-led output cuts.  Among premarket movers, J.C. Penney was the most traded stock, rising 1.35 percent after the department store operator said its same-store sales during the key selling months of November and December rose 3.4 percent.  Macy\u2019s shares were down about 1 percent after the company reported a 1 percent rise in same-store sales for the last two months of 2017 and announced measures to save about $300 million in costs..  Tesla\u2019s shares slipped about 3 percent after the electric car maker delayed a production target for its new Model 3 sedan for the second time.  Victoria\u2019s Secret-owner L Brands fell 10 percent on disappointing quarterly earnings forecast.  Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj\nKalluvila"

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When a homeless friend told Xavier Van der Stappen that rough sleepers cherish large cardboard boxes because they offer not only shelter but also a place to hide from the shame of living on the street, he decided to act.  Using cardboard donated by a local factory, Van der Stappen worked with designers to produce 20 portable cardboard tents, which homeless people are using on the streets of the Belgian capital during the cold winter.  \u201cThere are homeless people everywhere. When I saw them, it made me remember refugee camps in Africa,\u201d said Van der Stappen, the man behind the ORIG-AMI project.  \u201cIt is a shame that in the 21st century there are still people living in streets in a very rich country like Belgium.\u201d  The region around Belgium\u2019s capital city had more than 4,000 homeless people last March, according to La Strada, a public body which tracks the numbers of homeless.      Canvas tents are banned on the streets of Brussels, as camping is forbidden in the city, and cartons are usually disposed of by city cleaning services.   Van der Stappen said the tents were needed as many hostels were full and strict rules stopped some people using them.  \u201cThey cannot go with a dog or as a couple; they cannot drink,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   \u201cAlcohol is a problem, but for them also a solution because if they drink they forget about everything. So it\u2019s a way to escape their problems.\u201d  The factory that donated the cardboard recommended Van der Stappen use a local prison service to make the tents. The irony of the situation appealed to him.  \u201cFor me, it was kind of a symbol,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prisoners have a bed and food. The people in the street are free, but they are still in the street.\u201d  Feedback from users of the origami-style tents will inform an improved design and rollout of 100 more shelters over the rest of the winter, he said.  Van der Stappen paid for the first 20 tents himself. He thinks they could be hired out at summer festivals to fund the provision of more shelters next winter.   He is keen to stress, however, that he sees the cardboard tents as a temporary solution to homelessness.  \u201cI\u2019m not the person who is trying to solve it. I just try to find a solution for today, not for tomorrow,\u201d he said.  Reporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion. Editing by Katy Migiro.

The device, FreeStyle Libre Flash, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September. It allows diabetes patients to continuously track blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers.  Abbott\u2019s device is the second continuous glucose monitoring system after DexCom Inc\u2019s G5 Mobile to be covered by the federal agency.  DexCom\u2019s device is similar to Abbott\u2019s, but requires fingertip testing about two to four times a day for optimal accuracy.  Abbott\u2019s device has a retail price of $70 for a reader and $36 per sensor, which lasts for 10 days.   \u201c(This) cost is much less than other CGM systems that are available commercially,\u201d said Jared Watkin, senior vice president of Abbott\u2019s Diabetes Care unit.  Watkin added that the Medicare pricing would be different as it is based on certain reimbursement codes.  CMS rolled out deep cuts to reimbursement rates for certain laboratory and diagnostic tests under Medicare in November, a move that could save the government about $670 million in Medicare payments in 2018.  The reimbursement rates for the CGM system under the existing codes are $3,000 for a year, of which the federal agency pays $2,400 and the rest is paid out of pocket by the patients, Watkin said. \u201cThose codes can change,\u201d he added.

Macron has said he and his team were victims of fake news and a major data hack during his election campaign last year.

Macron, who has cut back on the close relations his predecessor, Francois Hollande, had with the media, said the authorities must keep their distance with the press.  \u201cThe closeness which we had on occasions got used to was, I think, neither good for those in government nor for the journalists,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt sometimes led to more importance being given to  backroom chatter than to official comments,\u201d he said, calling for a \u201chealthy distance\u201d to be maintained with the press.

Cityblock Health investors also include Dr. Mario Molina, the former chief executive of Molina Healthcare, and a new investment firm formed by Andy Slavitt, the former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama.  The new company hopes to improve care by making it easier for low-income patients living in city neighborhoods to get personalized care, including preventive visits, mental health coverage and access to appropriate social service programs.  The hope is that these services will improve patient health and avoid unnecessary emergency room visits or a bigger healthcare crisis that requires a hospital admission.  Cityblock works with a variety of entities including providers, health plans and community organizations to provide the service at no extra cost to patients. The company hopes to open its first healthcare hub in New York this spring.  \u201cDespite the boom in venture-backed and technology-based innovations, people on Medicaid and other low-income urban populations have been largely left behind,\u201d said Cityblock\u2019s CEO and co-founder Iyah Romm.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The red carpet is rolling out, the champagne is on ice and the statuettes are about to be handed over.  But with the cloud of sexual harassment hanging over Hollywood\u2019s annual round of self-congratulations, the Golden Globe ceremony on Sunday marks the first test of how the industry will handle live on the world\u2019s stage a scandal that has rocked show business.  \u201cThis is an issue that is center stage in Hollywood and is playing out at the award shows,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Neil, founder of awards website GoldDerby.com.  Celebrities and filmmakers who were once major players during awards season have been shunned, written out of shows or snubbed in nominations.  Women are planning to wear black on the Golden Globes red carpet to signal support of sexual harassment victims; a major talent agency has canceled its annual Golden Globes party to instead fund legal defense for victims; and the Screen Actors Guild Awards later in January will feature all female presenters.  The mood ahead of the Oscars on March 4 ranges from nervousness to eagerness to take a stand.  \u201cEveryone I have been talking to is relishing the opportunity to make this kind of visibility and attention more meaningful than simply about the glorification of a single profession,\u201d actress Michelle Williams, who is Golden Globe nominated for \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d told Reuters.  More than 30 men have accused Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct and more than 70 women have made allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein.  Dustin Hoffman, comedian Louis C.K. and Jeffrey Tambor are among dozens of other celebrities, politicians and businessmen who have been accused of sexual impropriety.  Reuters is unable to independently verify any of the accusations. Weinstein has denied having any non-consensual sex with anyone, Spacey apologized to one of his accusers but was erased from \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d and written out of his TV series \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d  Hoffman and Tambor have denied any wrongdoing. C.K. admitted past misconduct and his movie and TV projects have been dropped.  \u201cI always saw this awards season as a perfect little bubble where everything is magical and beautiful because it\u2019s movies. I think what we\u2019re realizing now is that it has its own issues that it has to work on,\u201d Emily Gordon, screenwriter for movie \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d told Reuters  On Sunday, all eyes will be on Golden Globes host Seth Meyers and how he navigates what is traditionally a boozy celebration and the elephant in the room.  \u201cHe\u2019s got an impossible job. He can\u2019t ignore the hot button issue in Hollywood. He\u2019s expected to lead a jokathon but it\u2019s not a laughing matter,\u201d said O\u2019Neil.  Hollywood is also at odds with itself. Matt Damon was slammed in December for suggesting that allegations of rape and inappropriate touching should not be conflated. Talk show host James Corden was criticized for joking about Weinstein at a Beverly Hills event in October, and Rose McGowan accused Meryl Streep of remaining silent about Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior. Streep denied the accusation and called for women to unite.  \u201cThis is getting to be a whole internecine battle in Hollywood. I think they are all very nervous,\u201d said Pete Hammond, awards columnist for Deadline.com.  The Golden Globe awards for film and television will be televised live from Beverly Hills on NBC on Sunday Jan. 7, starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT (0100 GMT on Monday).

Anti-government demonstrations erupted a week ago in Iran, and U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed support for the protesters. At least 21 people have died in the demonstrations, which began as protests against economic hardship.

Trump has long criticized that agreement.  \u201cThe current situation, when Washington gives in to the temptation to raise more questions\u201d on the nuclear agreement, Ryabkov said, is evidence that the United States is trying to undermine adherence to the deal.   He also said Moscow is sticking to the position that the deal \u201cis not to be corrected\u201d, playing down Washington\u2019s stance on the agreement.  In October, Trump declined to certify that Iran was complying with the nuclear deal. He must decide in mid-January if he wants to continue to waive energy sanctions on Iran.

          "title": "COLUMN-Banks rake in record fees to beat trading blues: McGeever",
          "body": "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)  By Jamie McGeever  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - By one measure, 2017 was the most lucrative year in history for investment banks.  The fees they charged companies and other financial firms for advising on mergers and acquisitions, arranging loans, and underwriting sales of bonds and stocks reached $104 billion, according to Reuters data.  That was up 16 percent on the previous year and the highest annual total for investment banking fees since Reuters started tracking the data in 2000.  This is noteworthy in itself, but especially so in light of what\u2019s happening to investment banks\u2019 primary source of revenue: trading.  Rapid technological change, automated trading, tighter regulation that limits banks\u2019 capacity to hold fixed income inventory on their books, and record low market volatility have conspired to reduce trading revenue in recent years.  According to industry data provider Coalition, the top 12 investment banks pulled in $119 billion from bond, currency, commodities and equity trading in 2016, the last full year for which figures are available. That\u2019s down nearly 15 percent from $140 billion in 2012.  Trading accounted for revenues of $61.1 billion in the first half of 2017, Coalition figures show. As the bulk of trading activity is conducted in the first six months of any year, it looks like the 2017 total will be the lowest in years.  Most of the decline is in fixed income, currency and commodities \u2014 or FICC \u2014 trading, where regulation has been tightened most and where banks have pulled back most. Equity trading is holding up better but remains a far smaller share of banks\u2019 trading pie than FICC.  The new year is only a few days old but there is no sign of a pick-up in market volatility, a prerequisite for a rebound in trading activity and revenue.  The VIX index of implied volatility on Wall Street has traded below 9 percent on only seven days since its launch nearly 30 years ago. Six have been in the last six months, and two of them have been this week.  Even though the Fed is raising U.S. interest rates and other central banks are gradually turning off the stimulus taps, currency and bond market volatility remains anchored near historic lows too.  In a world of weak trading, equity capital market (ECM) and debt capital market (DCM) activity is commanding a greater share of big banks\u2019 revenues and profits with every passing year.  A bumper 2017 was always likely given that last year saw a high number and value of deals across equity and debt markets, the lowest stock and bond volatility on record, and dozens of new highs for global stock markets.  Even still, it was a remarkable year for fees. The record $104 billion was comprised of $28.1 billion from M&A advisory services, $31.3 bln from DCM activity, $22.4 bln from ECM underwriting and $22.2 bln from syndicating loans.  ECM fees leapt 42 percent to a three-year high of $22.4 billion. As a share of overall ECM activity that was 2.9 percent, according to Reuters calculations \u2014 the highest in at least a decade and well up from 2.1 percent in 2016.  The surge in ECM fees far outstripped the rise in ECM activity and transaction value.  Companies raised $783.7 billion in equity during 2017, up 18 percent from the previous year and the strongest annual period for global ECM issuance in two years. The 5,735 ECM offerings during the year marked a rise of 21 percent over 2016 and was the strongest full-year period since records began in 1980, the Reuters data showed.  DCM fees rose 15 percent to a new record $31.3 billion. Always tiny compared to overall DCM transactions, they rose to 0.4 percent of the value of transactions from 0.3 percent in 2016, according to Reuters calculations.  Again, the rise in fees wasn\u2019t matched by changes in the value or number of transactions. The number of debt issues globally rose 11 percent to 23,321, a new record for a calendar year while DCM activity actually slipped to $7.2 trillion, although that was the second consecutive year above $7 trillion.

          "body": "(Adds details from report)  WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose for a third straight week last week, but that likely does not suggest a material shift in labor market conditions as data for several states, including California, were estimated.  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 250,000 for the week ended Dec. 30, the Labor Department said on Thursday.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 240,000 in the latest week. Claims tend to be volatile around holidays. Data for California, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming were estimated.  In addition, the Labor Department said claims-taking procedures continued to be disrupted in the Virgin Islands months after Hurricanes Irma and Maria battered the islands. It said claims processing in Puerto Rico was still not back to normal.  Last week marked the 148th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.  The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.  Minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Dec. 12-13 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed officials at the U.S. central bank upbeat about the economy and labor market prospects. Fed officials viewed economic activity as \u201crising at a solid rate,\u201d and the labor market as continuing to strengthen.  The central bank raised interest rates three times last year and has forecast three rate hikes in 2018.  Some economists, however, expect the Fed to increase borrowing costs four times this year, citing the $1.5 trillion tax cut package passed by the Republican-led U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.  Last week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 3,500 to 241,750.  The claims report has no impact on December\u2019s employment report, due to be released on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 190,000 in December after gaining 228,000 in November.  The unemployment rate is seen unchanged at 4.1 percent. Thursday\u2019s claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 37,000 to 1.91 million in the week ended Dec. 23.  The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 750 to 1.92 million. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao, Chizu Nomiyama and Frances Kerry)"

Sales of detached homes, which fell 23 percent, accounted for much of the 2017 drop, while condo sales pulled back a more muted 9.6 percent, according to a report from the Toronto Real Estate Board.  Declines in the second and third quarters followed a record high in the first quarter, but the pace picked up again in the year\u2019s last three months as some buyers may have accelerated home purchases to beat new mortgage stress test requirements that started on Jan. 1, the real estate board said.  The Ontario government implemented multiple measures, including a foreign buyers tax, in late April to try to ease the Toronto region\u2019s surging housing markets.  The impact of those measures and two recent interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada will be compounded by the new mortgage rules aimed at safeguarding lenders and borrowers.  Even as sales fell, the average selling price for the year jumped 12.7 percent from 2016 to C$822,681 ($657,145.94), the real estate board said.

The paper said it bought access for as little as 500 rupees ($7.89) from someone on a WhatsApp social media group.

          "body": "* Extreme weather ranges from wildfires to Arctic thaw  * 2017 was hottest year without an El Nino event in the Pacific  By Alister Doyle Environment Correspondent  OSLO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Last year was the second hottest worldwide on record, just behind a sweltering 2016 with signs of climate change ranging from wildfires to a thaw of Arctic ice, a European Union monitoring centre said on Thursday.  The Copernicus Climate Change Service, the first major international weather agency to report global 2017 temperatures, said they averaged 14.7 degrees Celsius (58.46\u00b0F) or 1.2C (2.2F) above pre-industrial times.  Last year was slightly \u201ccooler than the warmest year on record, 2016, and warmer than the previous second warmest year, 2015,\u201d the report said. Temperature records date back to the late 19th century.  The measurements back up a projection by the U.N. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in November that 2017 would be second or third warmest behind 2016, as part of a long-term trend driven by man-made greenhouse gases.  Sweltering temperatures in 2016 were also boosted by a natural El Nino event that happens every few years and releases heat from the Pacific Ocean.  Last year was the warmest year on record without the influence of an El Nino, according to Copernicus, run by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.  In the Arctic, \u201csea-ice cover was ... below average, especially during the cooler months at the beginning and the end of the year,\u201d it said.  \u201cMeanwhile, southern Europe was hit hard by prolonged dry conditions from late spring into the autumn months. The dry conditions led to water shortages in many areas and facilitated the spread of wildfires on the Iberian Peninsula,\u201d it said.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts that climate change has a human cause, tweeted on Dec. 29 about bone-chilling cold in the United States and cast doubt on the need for action to limit emissions.  \u201cPerhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!\u201d he wrote.  Trump plans to quit the 2015 Paris Agreement, which has the backing of almost 200 nations and seeks to limit the rise in temperatures to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, ideally 1.5 (2.7F).  Earlier on Thursday, German reinsurer Munich Re said insurers will have to pay claims of around $135 billion for 2017, the most ever, following a spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America.  It said that total losses, including those not insured, were $330 billion, the second-worst in history after 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc in Japan.  The WMO will publish its review of 2017 temperatures, also drawing on U.S., British and Japanese data, in about two weeks.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May apologized on Thursday to tens of thousands of patients whose operations were canceled to free up staff and beds to deal with emergency patients.  Earlier this week, officials at the National Health Service (NHS) in England recommended that hospitals cancel all non-urgent appointments and operations until next month.  May, during a visit to a hospital outside London, said she recognized it is frustrating for patients who had their operations postponed.  \u201cI know it is difficult, I know it is frustrating, I know it is disappointing for people and I apologize,\u201d she told Sky News.   A flu outbreak, colder weather and high levels of respiratory illnesses have put hospitals in England under strain with many operating at or near full capacity.  The issue is potentially damaging for May, already weakened after losing a parliamentary majority in last year\u2019s election and struggling to pacify her deeply divided party as she navigates the final year of Brexit negotiations.  The NHS, which delivers free care for all and accounts for a third of government spending on public services, is typically one of the most important issues for voters during elections and one which is often regarded as a weakness for May\u2019s Conservative party.  Opposition parties regularly accuse the government of failing to adequately fund the health service.  \u201cMinisters refused to provide the funding top NHS officials said was necessary and now patients are paying the price,\u201d said Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats.   Founded in 1948 by the opposition Labour Party, the NHS is a source of huge pride for many Britons who are able to access free care from cradle to grave.  But tight budgets, an aging population and increasingly complex medical needs have left many hospitals struggling during the winter in recent years.  The pressure continues to grow, according to new data on Thursday.  The number of patients stuck in ambulances for at least an hour almost doubled to more 4,700 cases during the Christmas week compared with the week before.  Department of Health guidelines say ambulance crews should be able to hand patients over to hospital staff within 15 minutes of arrival at hospital.  The average bed occupancy for the Christmas week was 91.7 percent. Doctors say that anything above 85 percent is unsafe.  The conditions have led some doctors taking to Twitter to vent their frustrations.  One London-based doctor wrote that conditions were so bad that he was practicing \u201cbattlefield medicine\u201d, while another apologized for the \u201c3rd world conditions\u201d caused by overcrowding.

          "title": "Ireland does not see big investment impact from US tax changes",
          "body": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland\u2019s investment agency does not expect corporate tax changes in the United States to have a significant impact on multinational companies\u2019 continued investment in Ireland, its chief executive said on Thursday.  Foreign companies employ one in 10 workers in Ireland where the low 12.5 percent corporate tax rate has long made it a hub for multinationals, particularly from the United States, with the likes of Google and Facebook among the major employers.  The equivalent corporate tax rate in the United States was cut to 21 percent from 35 percent last month in the largest change to U.S. tax laws since the 1980s.   \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, this is an effort to make the U.S. more competitive. It will make the U.S. more competitive. That may mean that there are some marginal calls where a company decides to stay in the U.S. rather than come to Europe,\u201d IDA Ireland chief executive Martin Shanahan told a news conference.    \u201cBut does it signal a significant change from an Irish perspective? I don\u2019t believe so. I can tell you, sitting here today, that I expect the next couple of months to be strong in terms of investment.\u201d   While down a touch on last year\u2019s growth, employment by foreign direct investment firms rose by 5.3 percent in 2017 - over twice the national average - to reach 210,000 and exceed a five-year jobs growth target two years ahead of schedule.  That did not include any impact from Brexit-related moves by financial services firms, Shanahan said, many of which chose Ireland last year as a base for some operations.  Shanahan said he expected more of such moves from financial services, pharmaceutical and technology firms this year with some still assessing exactly what to do and others advancing their plans.   The IDA said it will seek to increase investment from Europe and growth markets such as China, India and Australia this year. Two-thirds of the 237 companies who invested in Ireland last year were North American, although that was down slightly from 2016.  Shanahan said the nine percent represented by growth markets in 2017 did not reflect the resources the IDA was putting into those areas, and he expected to see that number rise this year, pointing to recent investments from Turkey, Mexico and Uruguay for the first time.  \u201cThere are countries that would give their right arm to have the FDI investment we have from the United States, yet at the same time we must try and balance the portfolio,\u201d Ryan said.

          "body": "(Adds details of release, background)  OTTAWA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Producer prices in Canada increased by 1.4 percent in November, the most in almost three years, thanks mainly to higher prices for energy and energy products, Statistics Canada said on Thursday.  Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast prices would grow by 0.8 percent from October. The advance was the largest since the 1.9 percent recorded in February 2015.  Of the 21 major commodity groups, 16 were up, four fell and one remained unchanged.  Prices for energy and petroleum products strengthened for the fifth straight month, jumping by 6.3 percent on higher demand for gasoline, light fuel oils and diesel fuel. The increase was the largest since May 2016.  Prices for motorized and recreational vehicles grew by 0.7 percent thanks largely to a 1.3 percent fall in the value of the Canadian dollar against the greenback in November.  Many vehicles are priced in U.S. dollars and become more expensive when the Canadian currency weakens. The producer price index would have increased by 1.1 percent had the exchange rate stayed constant.  Raw material prices rose by 5.5 percent, pushed up by higher prices for crude energy products. Analysts had expected a 4.5 percent gain.  Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Bill Trott"

          "body": "* EDF reactor unit takes back old Framatome name  * France hopes Framatome will sell nuclear reactors abroad  * New name marks end of restructuring started in 2015 (Adds Framatome, Cogema detail)  PARIS, Jan 4 (Reuters) - French utility EDF integrated the nuclear reactor business of fellow state-owned group Areva and resurrected the unit\u2019s old name Framatome.  Framatome will be 75.5 percent owned by EDF, 19.5 percent by Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and 5 percent by engineering group Assystem.  It now employs 14,000 staff, designs and builds nuclear plants, sells nuclear fuel rods, and provides maintenance to more than 250 of about 440 reactors worldwide.  Framatome said in a statement it would have an international strategy but did not give sales targets. Before restructuring, Areva had forecast it would sell 10 of its flagship European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) worldwide by 2016.  Formed in 1958, Framatome built France\u2019s fleet of 58 nuclear reactors and was merged with nuclear fuel group Cogema to form Areva in 2001 with the aim of creating a world-leading company.  Amid hopes for a nuclear renaissance in 2006-2007, Areva sold four EPRs in France, Finland and China, but a decade later they are all years behind schedule and billions of euros over budget.  Heavy losses due to these delays, an African uranium mine investment gone awry and a dearth of orders following the 2011 Fukushima disaster wiped out Areva\u2019s equity and in 2015 the government decided to split up Areva in a state-led rescue.  EDF has said it is in talks with Saudi Arabia, South Africa and India about selling reactors, although delays at ongoing projects weigh on its export ambitions.  Late 2017, Chinese utility CGN again delayed the start-up of two EPRs in Taishan, west of Hong Kong, the first one from late 2017 to 2018, the second one from first-half 2018 to 2019.  An EPR under construction in Flamanville, France is set to start up end 2018, also years behind schedule.  Construction of the first EPR in Olkiluoto, Finland, started in 2005 and was set to be completed by 2009. In October 2017, the project was again delayed to May 2019.  EDF has also started work on two EPRs in Hinkley Point, Britain, with the first unit scheduled produce power by 2025.  In July, EDF said the Hinkley Point budget had increased by 1.5 billion pounds to stand at 19.6 billion ($26.5 billion) and said there was a risk of delay for both units.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pushed for stricter voter identification rules on Thursday and accused Democratic-led states of failing to cooperate with a presidential election fraud commission that he disbanded this week.  In a pair of posts on Twitter, the Republican president reiterated his allegations, without offering any evidence, that there was voter fraud in the November 2016 presidential election.   Trump won the White House through the state-by-state Electoral College system but lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes to Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Most state officials who oversee elections, including Republicans and Democrats, as well as election law experts say  voter fraud is rare in the United States.  On Wednesday, the White House said in a statement it was shutting down the bipartisan panel that Trump established in May to look into allegations of fraud in the 2016 contest, saying many states had refused to provide data.  Trump had now asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate and decide what action was needed, the White House said.  The panel was headed by Vice President Mike Pence, along with Kris Kobach, who as Kansas Secretary of State runs elections in that state and who has long urged new voting restrictions.  Their effort, however, quickly met resistance from a number of U.S. states as well as civil rights groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, which had both filed lawsuits opposing it.      States and the groups balked at the information requested by the commission such as names, birth dates, political affiliation and voting histories. More than 20 states refused outright to provide the data and others said they needed to study the issue.  On Thursday, Trump said uncooperative \u201cmostly Democratic states ... fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D.\u201d     A number of states such as Texas have already passed laws requiring voter identification. Critics say that can make it harder for some people, including minorities, to vote because they are less likely to have certain IDs. Proponents say such steps are necessary and are not onerous.  In July, a federal judge in Washington noted the advisory panel lacked legal authority to compel states to provide data, even as it allowed the commission\u2019s work to move forward. A U.S. appeals court later also allowed the panel to continue.  Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry"

          "body": "COLOMBO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said a panel investigating irregularities in government bond sales has recommended legal action against the finance minister and the head of the central bank at the time, in a case that has energised the opposition.  The case relates to a 2015 bond auction in which more than half the issue was sold to Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, a subsidiary of a company owned by the son-in-law of former central bank governor Arjuna Mahendran.  Sirisena said the presidential commission of inquiry had concluded that Perpetual Treasuries has made profits through illegal means and blamed the bank governor and other officials for the lapse.  Mahendran did not answer telephone calls or text messages from Reuters on Thursday seeking his comments on the panel\u2019s report which was submitted to the president on Dec. 31. But earlier appearing before the committee, Mahendran denied any wrongdoing.  Perpetual Treasuries also did not respond to a request for comment. In its submission to the panel, it too had denied any wrongdoing.  Sirisena, in a statement released late on Wednesday, said the panel had recommended charges of bribery and giving false evidence be brought against former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake for his role in the sale.  Karunanayake resigned from his portfolio in August over corruption charges in the bond probe, maintaining that he was innocent.  \u201cThe confidentiality, astuteness and auditing methods of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka were extremely weak. There were no tele-recording systems, electronic monitoring or even CCTVs,\u201d Sirisena said, summing up the recommendations of the commission.  Opposition parties as well as a faction of the ruling coalition have demanded parliament be convened earlier than the scheduled opening on Jan. 23 to debate the findings of the panel.  Sirisena said he was already acting on the committee\u2019s recommendations. \u201cI have already submitted this report to the Attorney General and the Commission recommends that the criminal and civil court action must be taken,\u201d he said.  Opposition lawmakers have said the bond auction had cost the state more than $1 billion because of rising borrowing costs.  $1 = 153.5000 Sri Lankan rupees\nReporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal; Editing by\nSanjeev Miglani and Subhranshu Sahu"

          "body": "* Hargreaves Lansdown stops taking money on 1,500 funds  * Bestinvest also suspends some funds; AJ Bell reviewing  * New rules, dubbed PRIIPS, went live on Jan. 1  By Simon Jessop  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Some of Britain\u2019s biggest investment platforms have stopped taking fresh money into hundreds of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and investment trusts after they failed to meet new European Union rules in time.  Hargreaves Lansdown and Bestinvest said they had been forced to act after the funds were too slow or refused to provide information required under the EU\u2019s new Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) legislation.  Bestinvest and another platform firm, AJ Bell, said they were still reviewing fund documentation and more suspensions could follow. Standard Life Aberdeen said all UK and European funds on its platform were compliant by the deadline.  Charles Stanley and Interactive Investor were not able to immediately confirm whether they had suspended any funds.  The suspensions will limit choice for investors, though some analysts say the industry has long been oversupplied, and they mark an embarrassing admission that parts of the investment sector have been too slow to implement major new regulations.  The rules took effect on Jan. 1 and require each fund to have a new Key Information Document (KID) available online for investors. The aim is to give information in a standardised format so investors can compare risks and costs across products and providers.  With the rules not finalised until September 2017, investment trusts had not had much time to get the relevant information in place, said Ian Sayers, chief executive of trade body The Association of Investment Companies (AIC).  \u201cSomething that should have had 12 months as a transitional period ended up with a matter of weeks,\u201d he said, adding he expected most funds to comply with the rules relatively quickly.  The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the sector, had no immediate comment.  More important, Sayers said, was whether the new information was useful for investors, with projections for future risk and returns coloured by recent strong performance for many funds as a result of easy central bank liquidity that few expect to last.  The launch of PRIIPs coincided with an even bigger set of new rules on Jan. 3 - the European Union\u2019s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or MiFID II - which further complicated the efforts of some to get ready on time.  The introduction of MiFID II generally went off without a hitch, the European regulator said on Wednesday, although some participants were given a last-minute waiver.  Hargreaves Lansdown, Britain\u2019s biggest online investment platform, said it had suspended around 1,200 ETFs and 300 investment trusts from its website on Tuesday as they had not supplied the correct KIDs in time. That equates to about a third of ETFs and just under a half of trusts on the platform.  The funds remain on the platform, but are not visible on the website and the company said it would not accept any fresh money from either new or existing clients into the funds.  Around 900 of the ETFs are U.S.-based and Hargreaves spokesman Danny Cox said he did not expect them to ever provide the correct KIDs. The other 300 are Europe-based and would likely provide them over time.  Of the 300 investment trusts, funds listed on the stock exchange as companies, around 200 are predominantly U.S.-based and not likely to comply, Cox said. \u201cMy understanding is that UK distribution by U.S. domiciled investment trusts and ETFs isn\u2019t a priority for them.\u201d  Of the remaining 96 investment trusts, the majority are UK-based and Cox, confirming earlier reports, said he expected them to provide the correct information and return to the website.  \u201cThe situation is moving, 10 are already back on and we are putting investments back onto the website as and when they provide the correct KID,\u201d Cox said. \u201cTo put this into context, the vast majority of Hargreaves Lansdown investors hold UK-domiciled investments and are unaffected by this issue.\u201d  Bestinvest, meanwhile, said it had suspended an unspecified number of investment trusts, including Sanditon Investment Trust, but at least two had since complied with the rules and were now available again.  \u201cWe are working with our data vendor to identify cases where PRIIP-compliant documentation is not in place and, where this is the case, we have and will temporarily suspend access to dealing in these,\u201d a spokesman for Bestinvest said.  \u201cThe situation is incredibly fluid as trusts have been rapidly supplying these over the last couple of days.\u201d (Additional reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Mark Potter)"

          "body": "The euro zone economy closed out the year with the strongest growth in nearly seven years, driven by accelerating services and manufacturing activity across all major economies, a survey showed on Thursday.  The news will put pressure on the European Central Bank to close out its aggressive stimulus this year, and coincides with the central bank\u2019s decision to halve its monthly bond purchases to 30 billion euros starting this month.  IHS Markit\u2019s Final Composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index - seen as a good overall growth indicator for the euro zone - rose to 58.1 in December from 57.5 in November and up slightly from the flash estimate of 58.0.  It is now at its highest since February 2011 and well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.  \u201cA stellar end to 2017 for the euro zone rounded off the best year for over a decade, continuing to confound widely held fears that rising political uncertainty would curb economic growth,\u201d Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a release.  The average composite euro zone PMI reading for 2017, 56.4, was the best annual trend since 2006, Williamson noted \u2014 just before the financial crisis.  The data suggested fourth-quarter economic growth of 0.8 percent, faster than many other developed-market economies and exceeding the median forecast of 0.6 percent in a Reuters poll last month.  Based on forward-looking indicators within the PMI release, the momentum is set to continue. The composite new orders index climbed to 58.0 last month - its highest since July 2007 - from 57.3. That demand pushed companies to add staff; hiring growth matched a 17-year record high set in November.  Euro zone unemployment peaked at 12.1 percent in the first half of 2013. It has now declined to 8.8 percent.  The services PMI, which is part of the composite, soared to its highest in more than six years, 56.6, up from 56.2 in November. That followed a report on Tuesday showing the manufacturing PMI climbed to its highest in more than two decades of survey data.  But price pressure eased, a disappointing development for the ECB, which has been struggling to boost inflation. The rate of increases in input costs and what business charge consumers slowed for the first time in five months. Still, inflationary pressures remain  at levels not seen in over six years.  \u201cBased on past experience, the extent to which demand appears to be outstripping supply for many goods and services suggests that inflationary pressures could continue to build in the coming months,\u201d noted Williamson.  \u201cA big question for 2018 will therefore be whether relatively high unemployment and spare capacity in many  countries will continue to hold down pay growth and keep a ceiling on consumer price inflation.\u201d  Reporting by Rahul Karunakar, editing by Larry King"

The Abu Dhabi index climbed 1.5 percent to its highest level since mid-August as First Abu Dhabi Bank surged 2.4 percent to 10.90 dirhams, bringing its gains in the last three days to 6.3 percent.  The stock rose on Wednesday above its 200-day average for the first time since September, triggering a minor double bottom formed by the lows since October. Of 10 analysts polled by Reuters, one has a \u201cstrong buy\u201d on the stock, five have a \u201cbuy\u201d and four have a \u201chold\u201d, with a median target of 11.75 dirhams.  Dubai\u2019s index edged up 0.1 percent to 3,464 points following four days of gains. Amlak Finance added 2.9 percent after saying it signed a memorandum of understanding with Egypt\u2019s Marseilia Group to develop a property project in Cairo.  Dubai\u2019s medium-term technical outlook turned positive this week as it began to rebound from the bottom of an uptrend channel dating back to early 2016. Technically, a rise in coming months to near the top of the channel would not be surprising, and would take the index above 3,700 points.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s index rose 0.7 percent to its highest level since early October, passing resistance around 7,200 points, which was support in August and September. Any clean break - another daily close above that level on Sunday - would point up to at least the September peaks around 7,400 points.  Al Rajhi Bank added 1.6 percent after its 2 percent gain on Wednesday.  Egypt\u2019s blue-chip index fell 0.4 percent.

In an apparent acceleration of last year\u2019s global equity boom, MSCI\u2019s world index and London\u2019s FTSE both set records in Europe, and the Dow Jones was expected to break the 25,000 barrier when Wall Street reopens.  Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei - Asia\u2019s biggest market - had earlier shot to its highest since 1991 with a 3.3 percent surge. Asia-Pacific excluding Japan scaled a decade-high peak as a fifth day of gains in China helped emerging market stocks to a 6 1/2-year high as well .  \u201cIt is a continuation of the goldilocks story,\u201d said Michael Metcalfe, State Street Global Markets\u2019 head of macro strategy. \u201cThe main theme last year was strong growth and accommodative (monetary) policy, and the data we have had so far suggest that the growth is expected to accelerate, and without inflation.\u201d  The data published on Thursday reinforced expectations that solid world growth will boost demand for goods, including oil, and lift corporate earnings.  China\u2019s services sector activity hit its highest level in more than three years, manufacturing data from Japan came in strong and euro zone surveys showed the bloc enjoying its strongest run in nearly seven years.  IHS Markit\u2019s Final Composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index - considered a good overall growth indicator for euro zone - rose to 58.1 in December from 57.5 in November and up slightly from a flash estimate of 58.0.  \u201cA stellar end to 2017 for the euro zone rounded off the best year for over a decade, continuing to confound widely held fears that rising political uncertainty would curb economic growth,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.  Another factor behind the upbeat mood was that minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s mid-December meeting released on Wednesday did little to change that view that it will stick to measured increases in U.S. interest rates.  They showed policymakers expect U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul will to boost consumer spending but are still uncertain about the wider impact the stimulus would have on things like inflation.  Fed funds rate futures moved to price a 75 percent chance of a rate hike by March, compared with around 60 percent at the end of last year. But markets are still not fully pricing in the three rate increases many Fed officials expect this year.  The dollar climbed off a three-month low after the minutes but was backsliding before U.S. markets re-opened. The dollar was at 112.64 yen and the euro up 0.4 percent at $1.2063. If the single currency gets above September\u2019s peak of $1.2092, it would return to ground last trod in early 2015.  Analysts are now wondering whether the strength of the euro zone economy could even encourage the European Central Bank to start raising its still-negative interest rates. \u201cWe see some very positive euro sentiment in the market right now,\u201d said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt.  Yields on French bonds held at 0.80 percent as neighbouring Germany\u2019s 10-year rates inched up to 0.45 percent . But Spain\u2019s yields saw their biggest drop in almost two months as it easily sold 4.6 billion euros of bonds.  The bigger focus, though, was on commodity prices, which often have a big influence on global inflation.  Oil prices were touching levels not seen since before commodity markets slumped in 2014 and 2015, boosted by tensions in key producer Iran and ongoing OPEC-led output cuts.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose as high as $62.17 per barrel, their highest level since mid-2015 before easing back. International benchmark Brent rose to a 2 1/2-year high of $68.19 a barrel.  At the same time, inflation expectations indicated by the gap between 10-year U.S. inflation-linked bonds and conventional bonds was above 2 percent, at the highest level since March.  \u201cOil appears to be traded at a premium compared to economic fundamentals because of concerns over development in Iran,\u201d said Motofumi Okoshi, senior economist at Nomura Securities.  At the moment though, forward contracts are trading cheaper than expected spot prices, a condition known as \u201cbackwardation\u201d, suggesting investors expect any supply shortages to be temporary.  \u201cIf conditions in Iran deteriorate further, I expect forward contracts will begin to be bought as well,\u201d Okoshi said.  Political concerns were also supporting safe-haven gold, which fetched $1,310 per ounce, after hitting a 3 1/2-month high of $1,321.5 on Wednesday.  Still, investors expect financial markets to stay stable overall. The Cboe Volatility index, which measures implied price volatility of U.S. stocks in the next one month, closed at 9.15 on Wednesday, just short of its record closing low of 9.14 touched on Nov. 3.

          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, marking the biggest monthly increase since March, a report by ADP Research Institute showed on Thursday.  Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the ADP National Employment Report would show a gain of 190,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from 165,000 to 225,000.  Private payroll gains in the month earlier were revised down to 185,000 from an originally reported 190,000 increase.  The report is jointly developed with Moody\u2019s Analytics.  The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department\u2019s more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.  Economists polled by Reuters are looking for U.S. private payroll employment to have grown by 185,000 jobs in December, down from 221,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is expected to have changed by 190,000.  The unemployment rate is forecast to stay steady at the 4.1 percent recorded a month earlier.

          "body": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Athens is exploring whether eight Turkish soldiers who fled to the country after a failed coup attempt against Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan can be tried in Greece, Justice Minister Stavros Kontonis said on Thursday.  Kontonis said Turkey would first need to make an official request for such a trial, which has not looked likely so far as Turkey has twice sought their extradition to face justice at home.  \u201cThe possibility of them being tried here for crimes committed abroad is being explored,\u201d Kontonis told reporters during a news briefing. \u201cThe prime minister (Alexis Tsipras) has said that they must have a fair trial.\u201d  Kontonis said that such a trial may be possible under the Greek penal code.  The trial could be on some, but not all, of the charges brought by Turkey or new ones. The two countries have signed agreements on criminal acts such as terrorism and the penal code may apply to both Greeks and foreigners in that case, regardless of where any crimes were committed.   The soldiers are not accused of anything by Greece.   The eight men - three majors, three captains and two sergeant majors - flew to Greece by helicopter on July 16 in 2016, saying they feared for their lives.  Turkey, which regards the soldiers as traitors, has accused Athens of harboring coupists. Greece denies the accusations and says justice is independent.           Kontonis\u2019 statements are the latest twist in the case which has strained relations between Athens and Ankara, the two NATO allies who are at odds over a host of issues from ethnically split Cyprus to sovereignty over airspace.  Greek courts have already rejected requests the soldiers be extradited to Turkey.     \u201cThe extradition issue is definitely closed,\u201d Kontonis said.    On Dec. 29 an asylum board granted asylum to one of the soldiers, a pilot, a decision which further angered Turkey.  The Greek government appealed against that decision and a court will look into the case again. The soldier has been released.  Since the attempted coup, Turkish authorities have jailed around 50,000 people pending trial while more than 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military, public and private sectors.

          "title": "Pakistan shrugs off impending U.S. aid cuts, wary of harsher measures",
          "body": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan is shrugging off proposed U.S. aid cuts but frets that Washington could take more drastic measures to deter what it sees as the South Asian nation\u2019s support for Taliban militants causing chaos in neighboring Afghanistan.  Washington plans to imminently slash \u201csecurity assistance\u201d to Pakistan, U.S. congressional aides told Reuters on Wednesday, although the type, scale and length of the cuts was unclear. A day earlier, the White House said it would suspend about $255 million in already delayed military assistance.   Tense ties between the uneasy allies nosedived on Jan. 1 when President Donald Trump lashed out on Twitter against Islamabad\u2019s \u201clies and deceit\u201d despite $33 billion in aid and the White House warned of \u201cspecific actions\u201d to pressurize Pakistan.  A staunch U.S. Cold War ally and key player in the U.S.-backed invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Pakistan has watched warily as Washington has in recent years pivoted towards its arch-foe India.   Over the past decade, U.S. threats to cut aid have been part and parcel of its frustrating relationship with Pakistan, a nation also seen as vital to the peace process in Afghanistan.  \u201cAid cuts will not hurt us,\u201d Miftah Ismail, Pakistan\u2019s de facto finance minister, told Reuters.  \u201cThat\u2019s not the leverage they have, because it is something they have reduced drastically over the years.\u201d  Pakistan received about $1 billion in U.S. assistance in 2016, down from a peak of about 3.5 billion in 2011, Pakistani and U.S. officials say.   About $550 million of the 2016 total came from the Coalition Support Fund (CSF), a U.S. Defence Department program to reimburse allies for the costs of supporting counter-terrorist and counter-insurgency operations. Pakistan was the largest recipient of such funds.  The remaining $450 million was a mix of military assistance and funds for international non-government bodies (NGOs) and other development programs, Pakistan\u2019s finance ministry says.  Analysts say there are limits to how much the U.S. can fracture relations, since Pakistan cannot be isolated or completely sidelined, because of its proximity to, and influence in, Afghanistan.    \u201cThere is really no way forward for the United States in Afghanistan without Pakistan playing some kind of cooperative and collaborative role,\u201d said Huma Yusuf, a Wilson Center Global Fellow.  Islamabad worries that the United States, seeking to exert greater pressure on its ally, could in future train its crosshairs on Pakistan\u2019s fragile economy and impose some sort of financial sanctions.  Pakistani officials warn economic damage would weaken the country, proving counterproductive in Washington\u2019s battle against Islamist militant groups in South Asia.  \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how the U.S. financially or militarily hurts us and their own war effort doesn\u2019t get hurt,\u201d said Ismail, adding that it was impossible to find a solution to the Afghan conflict \u201cwithout Pakistan being part of it\u201d.  Last year, U.S. officials said the options being discussed to push Pakistan to change its behavior included targeted sanctions of officials with ties to militant groups waging an insurgency in Afghanistan.  The U.S. officials have also suggested the Pentagon may ramp up drone strikes, driving Pakistani media to speculate if such air attacks would be widened beyond areas bordering Afghanistan.      Islamabad could \u201creview its cooperation if it is not appreciated\u201d, its United Nations representative, Maleeha Lodhi, told media this week, which many interpreted as a reference to the vital transport route ferrying supplies to U.S. troops in Afghanistan through Pakistan\u2019s territory.  Pakistan remains committed to friendly relations with the United States, its powerful army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa, told Capital TV on Wednesday, but warned Washington against \u201ccoercion\u201d, and vowed not to \u201ccompromise on our self-respect\u201d.  Pakistan supported the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s as a foil to Indian influence in Afghanistan, and analysts say its military and security services maintained ties long after the Taliban regime was toppled in 2001.  Today the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militants are effectively an arm of Pakistan\u2019s foreign policy, U.S. officials say. Pakistan staunchly denies using proxies.  Ties with the United States are likely to stay fraught as Pakistan\u2019s strategic calculus remains unchanged, said Raoof Hassan, executive director of the Islamabad-based Regional Peace Institute.  \u201cAs long as Pakistan continues to consider the Afghan Taliban as a strategic asset, which it can use some time in the future to become more relevant and influential in Kabul, there is no meeting point,\u201d he said.   \u201cThe positions are diametrically opposite.\u201d  Additional reporting by Saad Sayeed in ISLAMABAD and Syed Raza Hassan in KARACHI; Writing by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Clarence Fernandez"

          "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. energy industry braced for a major test to refineries and power plants as an intense winter storm roared up the Atlantic Coast, bringing heavy snowfall and high winds to a region already beset with several days of extreme cold.  The storm is the product of a rapid and rare sharp drop in barometric pressure known as bombogenesis, or bomb cyclone. Heavy snow pounded the East Coast along a front stretching from Maine as far south as North Carolina early on Thursday, knocking out power, icing over roadways and closing hundreds of schools.  Prices for heating oil HO-NYH HO-DIFF-NYH and natural gas in the U.S. Northeast hit their highest levels in years on the back of near-record heating demand. Benchmark U.S. heating oil futures are near the highest in almost three years.  The extreme cold has stoked fears that a significant disruption could lead to a heating oil shortage, as inventories of distillate products, including heating oil, in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions are at their lowest levels for this time of year since 2015. A number of tankers carrying diesel and heating oil from Europe are bound for the United States to address supply worries, reversing a traditional trade route.  Reliance on heating oil is highest in the Northeast region, with about 21 percent of households using oil for space heating.  The U.S. Coast Guard in the key ports of Boston, New York Harbor and Philadelphia have deployed ice-breaking ships to help keep trade traffic moving, but delays were expected. Late on Wednesday, the Coast Guard said ice-breaking assets would seek safe haven from the winter storm but deploy after to ensure Northeast communities had the supplies, energy, and emergency resources needed.  Although most refineries, particularly those in northern climates, are designed to operate throughout the winter, increasingly extreme weather conditions in recent years have tested their capabilities. In 2015, more than a third of the U.S. East Coast\u2019s capacity was abruptly shut down due to glitches during severe weather.  Refiners along the U.S. East Coast were bracing for difficulties in the next few days, though they have largely escaped major trouble thus far.  Phillips 66 shut a crude and coking unit at its Wood River, Illinois, refinery after a line froze followed by a brief fire, a source told Reuters on Wednesday. It did not currently have a timeline for restarting the units at the Illinois plant, the source said.  Gasoline and diesel futures have climbed to four-year highs for this time of year, boosting key refining margins CL321-1=R to the highest in four years for the period.  Energy prices are vulnerable to further spikes if cold winter weather persists, but investors should position for the likelihood of lower prices later this year, Citi Research said in a note late on Wednesday.  \u201cThe impressive price strength recently should not be extrapolated into late 2018 as rising production of oil, LPG, natural gas and LNG, amid lower demand post-winter, should lower prices.\u201d  U.S. natural gas demand was expected to remain near record highs this week due to the frigid weather. Natural gas is the major fuel for residential and commercial heating in the U.S. Northeast and is also widely used by power plants.  \u201cNYMEX Henry Hub prices should rise further to the mid-$3 range, as cash Henry Hub prices already traded above $6. But the market, due to the supposed record-breaking production growth in 2018, still seems to be under-appreciating the potential for cold weather persisting,\u201d Citi said.

          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - To quad or not to quad would not even be a question for any man aiming for the podium at this year\u2019s Olympics, as more of the complicated jumps fill routines and bring in the points.   But how far the sport - and skaters\u2019 bodies - will go in pursuit of the jumps, which require four complete revolutions before landing, is unknown.  At the recent Grand Prix Final in Japan, Nathan Chen, who has steadily racked up jumping records this year, including landing seven clean quads at the U.S. Championships this past spring, won the men\u2019s competition with tries for at least five quads in his free skate.  Hot on his heels was Japan\u2019s Shoma Uno, the first skater to successfully land a quad flip in international competition, who ultimately won the free part of the competition with a quad-filled programme but trailed Chen overall by half a point.  But both cleanly landed only a few of the quads, prompting questions about whether it was not smarter to lower the level of their programmes in the interest of success.  \u201cIf you keep on putting quads into a programme, it does kind of put your stability at risk,\u201d Uno told a news conference.  \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to show the crowds perfection, I want to show them that I\u2019m growing as a skater. So I\u2019ll go on with the challenging routines.\u201d  Quad jumps have a 30-year history in competition, dating from Canada\u2019s Kurt Browning, who in 1988 became the first person to land a legal quadruple jump - a quad toeloop.  Since then, five different varieties of the high-risk jump have become such an essential part of men\u2019s skating that no man has won Olympic gold quadlessly since 1994 - with one exception.  That was U.S. skater Evan Lysacek, who at the 2010 Vancouver Games defeated Russian defending champion Yevgeny Plushenko who said Lysacek had danced \u201crather than skating like a man.\u201d  Not everyone loves the trend towards athleticism required by the jumps.   Two-time U.S. Olympian Johnny Weir, who confessed that when he was competing quads were his \u201cnemesis,\u201d said he felt emphasis on the jumps - which command high points, especially in the second half of any program - has perhaps gone too far.  \u201cIt isn\u2019t as enjoyable to watch as it was from our era,\u201d Weir told Reuters in a telephone interview. \u201cNow it seems skaters will try to do quads that they aren\u2019t comfortable with because of the points.\u201d  Defending Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu and Spain\u2019s Javier Fernandez, both of whom can land jumps and are beautiful skaters, have achieved a good balance of athleticism and artistry, he added, whereas quads tend to be \u201ctechnique, mathematics and body type.\u201d  Patrick Chan, who at 27 is one of the older skaters on the circuit and came second to Hanyu in Sochi, has also expressed reservations.  \u201cNathan\u2019s trump card is the quads, mine is a little more understated,\u201d he told Reuters in Toronto. \u201cFor me, it is the fact I have more experience. \u201c  And the women may follow, though so far only retired Japanese skater Miki Ando has landed a quad in competition, at the junior level and back in 2002.   \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the younger generation has started to actively study these jumps,\u201d Evgenia Medvedeva, who will be the gold medal favourite if she is able to compete at the Games, said at a Moscow news conference after a Grand Prix event.   \u201cI think it\u2019s the next step of figure skating.\u201d  There is talk about possibly limiting the number of quads, but skaters oppose the idea. Russia\u2019s Mikhail Kolyada, who took bronze at the Grand Prix Final, said the jumps are important to add energy to routines, which attracts audiences.  But rather than capping the number of quads, perhaps more points should be given for other elements, U.S. Olympian Adam Rippon told Reuters.  \u201cI think if you made different point opportunities, you\u2019d see different skaters come forward so it\u2019s not just that a sloppy programme with quads always wins,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt would be different skaters bringing different parts of skating. It\u2019s not just jumps.\u201d  Additional reporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber in MOSCOW and Steve Keating in TORONTO, writing by Elaine Lies; editing by Amlan Chakraborty"

          "title": "Quad king Chen pushes for artistry ahead of Pyeongchang",
          "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Nathan Chen became the first figure skater to land five quadruple jumps in a single program last year, but the 18-year-old American insists he has much more to offer.  In his second season on the senior circuit, the 2017 U.S. national champion is hoping to prove at the Pyeongchang Olympics that he\u2019s not all about the quad.  Chen has packed his programmers with quadruple jumps, four-revolution jumps that have become key elements in world-class men\u2019s programmers.  But Chen has made special efforts to improve his presentation, turning to Canadian choreographers Shae-Lynn Bourne and Lori Nichol to develop his artistry \u2014 footwork, expression and other elements essential to a high score.  Chen says he is trying to \u201cimagine the program as a whole picture,\u201d and not unnecessarily waste energy on its individual components.   \u201cThat\u2019s definitely what I\u2019m trying to prove this season,\u201d Chen told reporters a day after winning his first senior grand prix event in Moscow in October.  \u201cObviously there is still work to be done. But definitely I\u2019m in the right direction.\u201d     Chen opened the season by beating defending Olympic and world champion Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan in Moscow, landing four quadruple jumps in his short program including a breathtaking combination of the quad lutz and triple toe loop.  In November he won the Skate America grand prix event despite one of the worst free skates of his senior career.   He had planned five quadruple jumps but only attempted four and put his hand on the ice on his quad flip before falling on his quad toeloop.  Chen redeemed himself at the Grand Prix Final in December, overcoming an error-filled free skate to win the title.   The youngest of five children, Chen was born in Salt Lake City to Chinese immigrant parents. He was not quite three years old when his hometown hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics.  Chen is skating his free program to music from the movie \u201cMao\u2019s Last Dancer\u201d, based on an autobiography of former Chinese ballet dancer Li Cunxin. Li defected to the United States and became one of the world\u2019s most acclaimed dancers.  Chen initially had reservations about Nichol\u2019s suggested soundtrack, saying it he thought it was \u201ca little bit too political.\u201d  But the music\u2019s melancholic strings and the plot\u2019s parallels with the story of Chen\u2019s parents helped dissipate his doubts.   \u201cI can be very emotional on the ice with that music,\u201d he said.   \u201cIt\u2019s cool to be able to tell their (my parents\u2019) story in a sense through my skating. Once all of that came together, I was definitely sold on the piece.\u201d  Chen has battled the uncertainty and nerves surrounding his first Olympic season by approaching it as if it were any other year.   \u201cI have literally no idea what to expect,\u201d Chen said.   \u201cI can\u2019t really think too far into the future. It\u2019s helping this Olympic season so I don\u2019t just start freaking out about what\u2019s in the future.\u201d  Chen recognizes that his performance in Pyeongchang could have a profound effect on the popularity of his sport in the United States.     \u201cComparatively to Japan and a lot of other countries, we are definitely lacking in fan base,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWe are lacking in a lot of participation.\u201d   Chen says the prospect of boosting figure skating participation back home motivates him, but also gives him more responsibility.   But he says he won\u2019t let the pressure of performing and raising the status of his sport weigh him down.  \u201cI think that at the end of the day, it\u2019s my life, it\u2019s my sport, it\u2019s my career,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt\u2019s all what I decide to do that day, honestly.\u201d  Reporting by Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty"

          "title": "Figureskating: Eating disorders dull skating's luster as awareness grows",
          "body": "TOKYO/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Japanese figure skater Akiko Suzuki was struggling with jumps when her coach said losing a kilogram could help. Instead, in two months she lost nearly a third of her body weight, putting her career - and her life - in danger.  Too weak to skate, she was diagnosed with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa. Her weight had fallen from 48 kg to 32 kg on her 160 cm frame.  \u201cThere were all these younger skaters coming along with good proportions, and I started wishing for longer legs. I got a real complex,\u201d she told Japan\u2019s NTV network.  \u201cBut since there was no way I could grow, the only thing I could do something about was my weight.\u201d   Eating disorders have long been an issue in figure skating, where lighter weights make performing easier and aesthetics dominate \u2014 as they do in ballet and gymnastics, which struggle with similar health problems.   But this year the toll has been higher.  U.S. skater Gracie Gold, citing psychological issues and an eating disorder, is taking a break for treatment and will almost certainly miss the Olympics, while Sochi Olympics team gold medalist Yulia Lipnitskaya, 19, shocked the skating world by quitting altogether after treatment for anorexia.  \u201cAnorexia is a disease of the 21st century,\u201d Lipnitskaya said on the Russian Skating Federation website. \u201cIt is quite common. Unfortunately, not everyone is able to cope with it.\u201d  Even those who can cope feel pressure.   \u201cI try to approach my relation to my body as responsibly as possible, because yes, now I can\u2019t eat after 6:00 p.m like I used to,\u201d Evgenia Medvedeva, a two-time world champion who will be favorite for gold if she is able to compete in Pyeongchang, told reporters in Moscow.  \u201cSport itself is discipline,\u201d she added. \u201cYou have to control yourself every day, and when you give in to weakness you hate yourself. I think everyone knows that feeling.\u201d  That sort of drive, essential for sporting glory, can also lead to eating disorders. But what pushed some to success and others towards illness was complicated, said Aya Nishizono-Maher, a professor at Shiraume Gakuen University in Japan.  \u201cPerfectionism, the inability to feel one\u2019s feelings or verbalize them to other people... And maybe the parents are very competitive or pressurize the daughter - usually it\u2019s girls - to highly achieve,\u201d she said, with lack of confidence also a part.  \u201cIn some clubs, the coaches weigh you before practice. And still some call the girls \u2018pig\u2019 or \u2018fat\u2019 when they gain.\u201d  Suzuki had always watched her weight. But when she became ill, she was under new pressure to advance at the senior level, and had also just left home for university in a distant city.  Successfully treated, she eventually made it to the 2006 and 2010 Olympics, but it took a year before she was strong enough to jump.  Two-time U.S. Olympian Johnny Weir told Reuters that the world of high level sports, where the weight of one day and one competition can be huge, is \u201cnot the most mentally healthy place to live\u201d and it can be easy to step over the line.  But he also warned about blowing the issue out of proportion since diet is par for elite athletes in all sports - and there are real reasons for a skater to weigh less.  \u201cWhen I was competing I knew I didn\u2019t get to have cake, or chicken fingers, or eat a big Thanksgiving dinner because... if I ate too much I would pay for it for three days,\u201d he said in a phone interview.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re coming down with 100 times the force of your body weight on landing a jump, it hurts,\u201d he added.   \u201cWhen I go skate and it\u2019s been a little while and I\u2019ve put on weight, you can feel every fiber of your knees and ankles reacting to this extra weight.\u201d  Weir thinks things may actually be getting better. In the past, there was more emphasis on specific body types - and nobody talked about the problem.   \u201cI do think it\u2019s very brave for Yulia Lipnitskaya and Gracie Gold to be open about this,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir telling about it will keep parents on guard, will keep coaches on guard.\u201d   Reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by John O'Brien"

          "body": "Jan 4 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares fell 3.5 percent in premarket trading on Thursday, setting the company up to lose nearly $1.9 billion in market value after it pushed back a production target for its much-anticipated Model 3 sedan yet again.  Analysts, however, stayed upbeat, saying the electric car maker had finally set an achievable target for their mass-market sedan that is priced at $35,000.  Tesla said on Wednesday it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. The company now expects to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.  \u201cWe believe that Tesla may have finally set a beatable production target,\u201d Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah wrote in a note to clients.  \u201cImportantly, we believe that Tesla is prioritizing quality control. While Tesla\u2019s repeated guidance revisions could begin to risk damaging its elite brand, a mass-recall would probably be far more damaging,\u201d he said.  Tesla shares fell to $306.06 in premarket trading on Thursday. The median price target on the stock is $310 and eight of 25 brokerages covering the stock rate it \u201cbuy\u201d or higher. Eight have a \u201chold\u201d rating and the rest a \u201csell\u201d or lower.  The company, headed by Elon Musk, has been struggling to overcome production bottlenecks and reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss in the third quarter.  Tesla\u2019s luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory and quality checks have routinely revealed defects in nearly all of these models inspected after assembly, Reuters reported in November, citing sources.  Tesla has maintained that its quality control process is unusually rigorous.  Building the car efficiently and delivering it without delays to customers is critical, as the money-losing company faces high cash burn. Delays increase the risk that reservation-holders will cancel orders.  Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he expects Tesla shares to be very volatile in 2018 as the company seesaws between dealing with increased competition and seeing production bottlenecks ease with strong cash inflow.  But most analysts stayed bullish on the stock on Thursday and said they continued to believe that sales of the Model 3 sedan could transform the niche automaker into a mass producer, giving it an edge over a host of rivals such as General Motors Co and BMW who are entering the nascent electric car market.  \u201cGiven that TSLA received over 400k Model 3 reservations with essentially no marketing, we believe potential demand for the vehicle is likely underestimated, and think TSLA could significantly increase demand through its own advertising in the future,\u201d Baird Equity Research analyst Ben Kallo said.

The Pyeongchang Olympics will be Fernandez\u2019s third and final Games and the 26-year-old, a five-time European champion, is keen to improve on his heart-breaking fourth-place finish at the 2014 Sochi Games.   \u201cI wanted to get onto the podium but it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Fernandez said of Sochi in an interview with the International Skating Union (ISU) website. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a bad competition but it was not good enough.\u201d  Fernandez was in third after the short program but a mistake in his free skate saw Kazakhstan\u2019s Denis Ten dislodge him and take the bronze.  After narrowly missing the podium, Fernandez returned to the rink with \u201cso much energy to give in practice\u201d.  \u201cSo I think it was actually positive for me to not even achieve the medal in Sochi,\u201d the ISU quoted him as saying.   Fernandez\u2019s consistency has been astonishing since then. He won back-to-back world titles, three consecutive European titles and two Grand Prix Final silver medals.   He did not qualify for December\u2019s Grand Prix Final but won the Grand Prix event in France in November with a season-best performance in the short program.   He was more than 10 points ahead of second-place finisher Shoma Uno of Japan, even though he fell on his quad Salchow and triple Axel in the free skate.   \u201cJavier is a fighter, a person whose ideas are clear and who follows his goals to the end,\u201d Spanish Ice Sports Federation (FEDH) general secretary Xavier Cherta told Reuters.   \u201cOnly good things can be said about Javier.\u201d  In Pyeongchang, Fernandez will be skating his free program to \u201cMan of La Mancha\u201d, a musical based on the 17th-century classic Spanish novel \u201cDon Quixote\u201d by Miguel de Cervantes.   Fernandez said that his choice of music was a wink to his compatriots, a gesture he hoped would be appreciated back home.   Although his fan base in Spain is not as large as those of tennis star Rafael Nadal and NBA veteran Pau Gasol, Fernandez has played a key role in developing the sport.  Cherta has seen Fernandez\u2019s success spark growing public interest in figure skating.   \u201cWhen we have a high-level athlete, he has to leave Spain to train because we cannot give him the facilities for his calibre,\u201d Cherta said.  \u201cBut Javier\u2019s appearance has allowed us to work toward building a high-performance center and we have the support of public institutions.\u201d    In its history Spain has won only two medals at the Winter Olympics \u2014 a gold in the men\u2019s slalom in 1972 and a bronze in the women\u2019s slalom in 1992 won by siblings Francisco and Blanca Fernandez Ochoa.  German-born cross-country skier Johann Muehlegg won three gold medals for Spain in the 2002 Salt Lake City Games only to be disqualified for doping.     Fernandez, who left Spain at 17 to pursue his figure skating career, also recognizes his role in transforming the landscape of Spanish sport.   \u201cWe got more support, more sponsors, more everything,\u201d Fernandez told the ISU.   \u201cNow people know about figure skating a little bit more. They know that we have a team that is competing.\u201d   Reporting by Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber; Editing by John O'Brien"

          "body": "PRAGUE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Czech Finance Ministry said it proposes to give up a European Union subsidy for a project at the centre of a police investigation that has hurt the minority government\u2019s chances of winning a parliamentary confidence vote.  The two million euro subsidy was awarded in 2008 to a farm and conference centre now owned by Agrofert, the biggest Czech private employer created by then businessman Andrej Babis and owned by him until he moved it to a trust fund last year.  The project called Stork Nest is at the centre of allegations that Babis, appointed prime minister after his party won an election in October last year, manipulated ownership of the project to win funding he was not entitled to.  The scandal is the chief reason why other political parties have refused to join Babis\u2019s ANO party in a coalition and why a minority cabinet led by Babis is expected to lose a parliamentary confidence vote planned for next week.  Babis denies any wrongdoing and says the case is a fabrication by opponents fearing his anti-corruption drive.  The case has been investigated by Czech police, who have charged Babis and others with fraud in the case, and by the EU\u2019s anti-fraud body OLAF.  In a statement on Thursday, the ministry said its recommendation to regional authorities in charge of managing EU subsidies followed a letter from the European Commission which recommended taking back requests to fund a number of projects under criminal investigation or investigation by OLAF.  \u201cThe European Commission...proposed to take out expenditure that is subject to administrative or criminal proceedings or proceedings by OLAF from European funding,\u201d the ministry said.  \u201cThe ministry therefore today turned to (regional administrators) and the Environment Ministry with a proposal to accept the European Commission letter.\u201d  Babis and his spokespersons were not immediately available for comment.  Stork Nest, a conference centre and a farm outside Prague, had undisclosed owners when it requested the subsidy. The funding, made under the EU\u2019s programme for poorer EU regions, was meant for small business and Babis\u2019s Agrofert would not qualify. It was however owned by Agrofert entities earlier and is now owned by Agrofert again.  Babis has been charged with subsidy fraud in the case but won parliamentary immunity in the election. The lower house is expected to vote on lifting his immunity in the coming weeks.  The EU\u2019s OLAF has completed its investigation of the case and sent recommendations to the Czech authorities. The report has not been released so far, with a Czech state attorney saying it could impede investigation.  It is up to regional Czech authorities to decide on the European Commission and the Finance Ministry recommendation. Officials there were not immediately available for comment.

The investigation is led by the Berlin-Neukoelln tax office, which is responsible for value added tax (VAT) registration of Chinese retailers in Germany, the paper said. The federal state of Berlin declined to comment.  Amazon said that retailers using the U.S. group\u2019s platform as a marketplace are independent enterprises and are responsible for their own tax obligations.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May apologised on Thursday to tens of thousands of patients whose operations were cancelled to free up staff and beds to deal with emergency patients.  Earlier this week, officials at the National Health Service (NHS) in England recommended that hospitals cancel all non-urgent appointments and operations until next month.  Officials say this means about 50,000 operations may be postponed.  \u201cI know it is difficult, I know it is frustrating, I know it is disappointing for people and I apologise,\u201d May told Sky News after visiting a hospital outside London.  A flu outbreak, colder weather and high levels of respiratory illnesses have put hospitals in England under strain with many operating at or near full capacity, with long waits for treatment in emergency rooms.  The issue is potentially damaging for May, already weakened after losing a parliamentary majority in last year\u2019s election and struggling to pacify her deeply divided party as she navigates the final year of Brexit negotiations.  The NHS, which delivers free care for all and accounts for a third of government spending on public services, is typically one of the most important issues for voters during elections and one which is often regarded as a weakness for May\u2019s Conservative party.

          "title": "Figureskating-Quads: how far will they go?",
          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - To quad or not to quad would not even be a question for any man aiming for the podium at this year\u2019s Olympics, as more of the complicated jumps fill routines and bring in the points.   But how far the sport - and skaters\u2019 bodies - will go in pursuit of the jumps, which require four complete revolutions before landing, is unknown.  At the recent Grand Prix Final in Japan, Nathan Chen, who has steadily racked up jumping records this year, including landing seven clean quads at the U.S. Championships this past spring, won the men\u2019s competition with tries for at least five quads in his free skate.  Hot on his heels was Japan\u2019s Shoma Uno, the first skater to successfully land a quad flip in international competition, who ultimately won the free part of the competition with a quad-filled programme but trailed Chen overall by half a point.  But both cleanly landed only a few of the quads, prompting questions about whether it was not smarter to lower the level of their programmes in the interest of success.  \u201cIf you keep on putting quads into a programme, it does kind of put your stability at risk,\u201d Uno told a news conference.  \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to show the crowds perfection, I want to show them that I\u2019m growing as a skater. So I\u2019ll go on with the challenging routines.\u201d  Quad jumps have a 30-year history in competition, dating from Canada\u2019s Kurt Browning, who in 1988 became the first person to land a legal quadruple jump - a quad toeloop.  Since then, five different varieties of the high-risk jump have become such an essential part of men\u2019s skating that no man has won Olympic gold quadlessly since 1994 - with one exception.  That was U.S. skater Evan Lysacek, who at the 2010 Vancouver Games defeated Russian defending champion Yevgeny Plushenko who said Lysacek had danced \u201crather than skating like a man.\u201d  Not everyone loves the trend towards athleticism required by the jumps.   Two-time U.S. Olympian Johnny Weir, who confessed that when he was competing quads were his \u201cnemesis,\u201d said he felt emphasis on the jumps - which command high points, especially in the second half of any program - has perhaps gone too far.  \u201cIt isn\u2019t as enjoyable to watch as it was from our era,\u201d Weir told Reuters in a telephone interview. \u201cNow it seems skaters will try to do quads that they aren\u2019t comfortable with because of the points.\u201d  Defending Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu and Spain\u2019s Javier Fernandez, both of whom can land jumps and are beautiful skaters, have achieved a good balance of athleticism and artistry, he added, whereas quads tend to be \u201ctechnique, mathematics and body type.\u201d  Patrick Chan, who at 27 is one of the older skaters on the circuit and came second to Hanyu in Sochi, has also expressed reservations.  \u201cNathan\u2019s trump card is the quads, mine is a little more understated,\u201d he told Reuters in Toronto. \u201cFor me, it is the fact I have more experience. \u201c  And the women may follow, though so far only retired Japanese skater Miki Ando has landed a quad in competition, at the junior level and back in 2002.   \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the younger generation has started to actively study these jumps,\u201d Evgenia Medvedeva, who will be the gold medal favourite if she is able to compete at the Games, said at a Moscow news conference after a Grand Prix event.   \u201cI think it\u2019s the next step of figure skating.\u201d  There is talk about possibly limiting the number of quads, but skaters oppose the idea. Russia\u2019s Mikhail Kolyada, who took bronze at the Grand Prix Final, said the jumps are important to add energy to routines, which attracts audiences.  But rather than capping the number of quads, perhaps more points should be given for other elements, U.S. Olympian Adam Rippon told Reuters.  \u201cI think if you made different point opportunities, you\u2019d see different skaters come forward so it\u2019s not just that a sloppy programme with quads always wins,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt would be different skaters bringing different parts of skating. It\u2019s not just jumps.\u201d  Additional reporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber in MOSCOW and Steve Keating in TORONTO, writing by Elaine Lies; editing by Amlan Chakraborty"

          "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Nathan Chen became the first figure skater to land five quadruple jumps in a single program last year, but the 18-year-old American insists he has much more to offer.  In his second season on the senior circuit, the 2017 U.S. national champion is hoping to prove at the Pyeongchang Olympics that he\u2019s not all about the quad.  Chen has packed his programmers with quadruple jumps, four-revolution jumps that have become key elements in world-class men\u2019s programmers.  But Chen has made special efforts to improve his presentation, turning to Canadian choreographers Shae-Lynn Bourne and Lori Nichol to develop his artistry \u2014 footwork, expression and other elements essential to a high score.  Chen says he is trying to \u201cimagine the program as a whole picture,\u201d and not unnecessarily waste energy on its individual components.   \u201cThat\u2019s definitely what I\u2019m trying to prove this season,\u201d Chen told reporters a day after winning his first senior grand prix event in Moscow in October.  \u201cObviously there is still work to be done. But definitely I\u2019m in the right direction.\u201d     Chen opened the season by beating defending Olympic and world champion Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan in Moscow, landing four quadruple jumps in his short program including a breathtaking combination of the quad lutz and triple toe loop.  In November he won the Skate America grand prix event despite one of the worst free skates of his senior career.   He had planned five quadruple jumps but only attempted four and put his hand on the ice on his quad flip before falling on his quad toeloop.  Chen redeemed himself at the Grand Prix Final in December, overcoming an error-filled free skate to win the title.   The youngest of five children, Chen was born in Salt Lake City to Chinese immigrant parents. He was not quite three years old when his hometown hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics.  Chen is skating his free program to music from the movie \u201cMao\u2019s Last Dancer\u201d, based on an autobiography of former Chinese ballet dancer Li Cunxin. Li defected to the United States and became one of the world\u2019s most acclaimed dancers.  Chen initially had reservations about Nichol\u2019s suggested soundtrack, saying it he thought it was \u201ca little bit too political.\u201d  But the music\u2019s melancholic strings and the plot\u2019s parallels with the story of Chen\u2019s parents helped dissipate his doubts.   \u201cI can be very emotional on the ice with that music,\u201d he said.   \u201cIt\u2019s cool to be able to tell their (my parents\u2019) story in a sense through my skating. Once all of that came together, I was definitely sold on the piece.\u201d  Chen has battled the uncertainty and nerves surrounding his first Olympic season by approaching it as if it were any other year.   \u201cI have literally no idea what to expect,\u201d Chen said.   \u201cI can\u2019t really think too far into the future. It\u2019s helping this Olympic season so I don\u2019t just start freaking out about what\u2019s in the future.\u201d  Chen recognizes that his performance in Pyeongchang could have a profound effect on the popularity of his sport in the United States.     \u201cComparatively to Japan and a lot of other countries, we are definitely lacking in fan base,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWe are lacking in a lot of participation.\u201d   Chen says the prospect of boosting figure skating participation back home motivates him, but also gives him more responsibility.   But he says he won\u2019t let the pressure of performing and raising the status of his sport weigh him down.  \u201cI think that at the end of the day, it\u2019s my life, it\u2019s my sport, it\u2019s my career,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt\u2019s all what I decide to do that day, honestly.\u201d  Reporting by Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty"

          "title": "Figureskating: Eating disorders dull skating's luster as awareness grows",
          "body": "TOKYO/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Japanese figure skater Akiko Suzuki was struggling with jumps when her coach said losing a kilogram could help. Instead, in two months she lost nearly a third of her body weight, putting her career - and her life - in danger.  Too weak to skate, she was diagnosed with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa. Her weight had fallen from 48 kg to 32 kg on her 160 cm frame.  \u201cThere were all these younger skaters coming along with good proportions, and I started wishing for longer legs. I got a real complex,\u201d she told Japan\u2019s NTV network.  \u201cBut since there was no way I could grow, the only thing I could do something about was my weight.\u201d   Eating disorders have long been an issue in figure skating, where lighter weights make performing easier and aesthetics dominate \u2014 as they do in ballet and gymnastics, which struggle with similar health problems.   But this year the toll has been higher.  U.S. skater Gracie Gold, citing psychological issues and an eating disorder, is taking a break for treatment and will almost certainly miss the Olympics, while Sochi Olympics team gold medalist Yulia Lipnitskaya, 19, shocked the skating world by quitting altogether after treatment for anorexia.  \u201cAnorexia is a disease of the 21st century,\u201d Lipnitskaya said on the Russian Skating Federation website. \u201cIt is quite common. Unfortunately, not everyone is able to cope with it.\u201d  Even those who can cope feel pressure.   \u201cI try to approach my relation to my body as responsibly as possible, because yes, now I can\u2019t eat after 6:00 p.m like I used to,\u201d Evgenia Medvedeva, a two-time world champion who will be favorite for gold if she is able to compete in Pyeongchang, told reporters in Moscow.  \u201cSport itself is discipline,\u201d she added. \u201cYou have to control yourself every day, and when you give in to weakness you hate yourself. I think everyone knows that feeling.\u201d  That sort of drive, essential for sporting glory, can also lead to eating disorders. But what pushed some to success and others towards illness was complicated, said Aya Nishizono-Maher, a professor at Shiraume Gakuen University in Japan.  \u201cPerfectionism, the inability to feel one\u2019s feelings or verbalize them to other people... And maybe the parents are very competitive or pressurize the daughter - usually it\u2019s girls - to highly achieve,\u201d she said, with lack of confidence also a part.  \u201cIn some clubs, the coaches weigh you before practice. And still some call the girls \u2018pig\u2019 or \u2018fat\u2019 when they gain.\u201d  Suzuki had always watched her weight. But when she became ill, she was under new pressure to advance at the senior level, and had also just left home for university in a distant city.  Successfully treated, she eventually made it to the 2006 and 2010 Olympics, but it took a year before she was strong enough to jump.  Two-time U.S. Olympian Johnny Weir told Reuters that the world of high level sports, where the weight of one day and one competition can be huge, is \u201cnot the most mentally healthy place to live\u201d and it can be easy to step over the line.  But he also warned about blowing the issue out of proportion since diet is par for elite athletes in all sports - and there are real reasons for a skater to weigh less.  \u201cWhen I was competing I knew I didn\u2019t get to have cake, or chicken fingers, or eat a big Thanksgiving dinner because... if I ate too much I would pay for it for three days,\u201d he said in a phone interview.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re coming down with 100 times the force of your body weight on landing a jump, it hurts,\u201d he added.   \u201cWhen I go skate and it\u2019s been a little while and I\u2019ve put on weight, you can feel every fiber of your knees and ankles reacting to this extra weight.\u201d  Weir thinks things may actually be getting better. In the past, there was more emphasis on specific body types - and nobody talked about the problem.   \u201cI do think it\u2019s very brave for Yulia Lipnitskaya and Gracie Gold to be open about this,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir telling about it will keep parents on guard, will keep coaches on guard.\u201d   Reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by John O'Brien"

          "title": "World champion Fernandez carries Spanish hopes",
          "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - When two-time world champion Javier Fernandez competes at the Pyeongchang Games next month, he will be hoping to end a 26-year Winter Olympic medal drought for Spain.   Fernandez trains in Canada but his success has reverberated to his native land, where figure skating has struggled to find a similar level of popularity enjoyed by soccer, tennis and basketball.  The Pyeongchang Olympics will be Fernandez\u2019s third and final Games and the 26-year-old, a five-time European champion, is keen to improve on his heart-breaking fourth-place finish at the 2014 Sochi Games.   \u201cI wanted to get onto the podium but it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Fernandez said of Sochi in an interview with the International Skating Union (ISU) website. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a bad competition but it was not good enough.\u201d  Fernandez was in third after the short program but a mistake in his free skate saw Kazakhstan\u2019s Denis Ten dislodge him and take the bronze.  After narrowly missing the podium, Fernandez returned to the rink with \u201cso much energy to give in practice\u201d.  \u201cSo I think it was actually positive for me to not even achieve the medal in Sochi,\u201d the ISU quoted him as saying.   Fernandez\u2019s consistency has been astonishing since then. He won back-to-back world titles, three consecutive European titles and two Grand Prix Final silver medals.   He did not qualify for December\u2019s Grand Prix Final but won the Grand Prix event in France in November with a season-best performance in the short program.   He was more than 10 points ahead of second-place finisher Shoma Uno of Japan, even though he fell on his quad Salchow and triple Axel in the free skate.   \u201cJavier is a fighter, a person whose ideas are clear and who follows his goals to the end,\u201d Spanish Ice Sports Federation (FEDH) general secretary Xavier Cherta told Reuters.   \u201cOnly good things can be said about Javier.\u201d  In Pyeongchang, Fernandez will be skating his free program to \u201cMan of La Mancha\u201d, a musical based on the 17th-century classic Spanish novel \u201cDon Quixote\u201d by Miguel de Cervantes.   Fernandez said that his choice of music was a wink to his compatriots, a gesture he hoped would be appreciated back home.   Although his fan base in Spain is not as large as those of tennis star Rafael Nadal and NBA veteran Pau Gasol, Fernandez has played a key role in developing the sport.  Cherta has seen Fernandez\u2019s success spark growing public interest in figure skating.   \u201cWhen we have a high-level athlete, he has to leave Spain to train because we cannot give him the facilities for his calibre,\u201d Cherta said.  \u201cBut Javier\u2019s appearance has allowed us to work toward building a high-performance center and we have the support of public institutions.\u201d    In its history Spain has won only two medals at the Winter Olympics \u2014 a gold in the men\u2019s slalom in 1972 and a bronze in the women\u2019s slalom in 1992 won by siblings Francisco and Blanca Fernandez Ochoa.  German-born cross-country skier Johann Muehlegg won three gold medals for Spain in the 2002 Salt Lake City Games only to be disqualified for doping.     Fernandez, who left Spain at 17 to pursue his figure skating career, also recognizes his role in transforming the landscape of Spanish sport.   \u201cWe got more support, more sponsors, more everything,\u201d Fernandez told the ISU.   \u201cNow people know about figure skating a little bit more. They know that we have a team that is competing.\u201d   Reporting by Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber; Editing by John O'Brien"

          "body": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey\u2019s broadcasting watchdog has fined a TV station nearly one million lira ($266,000) over footage of young girls dancing in shorts in a talent competition after viewers complained of \u201cchild abuse\u201d, a board member said on Thursday.  Citing moral dangers for the children, it penalized TV8  channel for footage in the \u201cYetenek Sizsiniz\u201d (\u201cYou Got Talent\u201d) program which showed a group of girls, aged from 7 to 11, who peformed in shorts and tank tops, the board member who did not want to be named told Reuters.  The move by the Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTUK) is likely to further anger government critics, who accuse President Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted ruling AK Party of trying to roll back secularism and civil rights for minorities, gay people and women.  Last year, hundreds of Turkish women marched in Istanbul to protest against violence and threats from men demanding they  dress more conservatively.  RTUK ruled that the footage had violated its ethical broadcast regulations and fined the channel 2 percent of its advertising revenues, amounting almost to 1 million lira.  The regulations state that \u201cprograms which contain content that could harm the physical, mental and moral development of children and youth cannot be broadcast\u201d.  RTUK said in a report that it had received complaints that the channel had exploited the children in an \u201cimmoral\u201d show.  \u201cThere were reactions from citizens for making minor children, aged 7-8, dance half-naked for ratings, amounting to child abuse,\u201d the report said.

          "body": "FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - German tax investigators have seized goods and accounts of about 100 Chinese online retailers selling products via Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in Germany and failing to pay sales taxes, daily Handelsblatt reported on Thursday, citing industry sources.  The investigation is led by the Berlin-Neukoelln tax office, which is responsible for value added tax (VAT) registration of Chinese retailers in Germany, the paper said. The federal state of Berlin declined to comment.  Amazon said that retailers using the U.S. group\u2019s platform as a marketplace are independent enterprises and are responsible for their own tax obligations.  A German taxpayers\u2019 union said in November that Germany could be losing out on 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) annually because online retailers from China, or other non-EU states, fail to pay value added taxes of 19 percent, knowingly or not.  Britain in November said it would introduce measures to hold online marketplaces like eBay (EBAY.O) and Amazon.com accountable when sellers on their platforms do not collect and pay VAT.

          "body": "(Add details)  DHAKA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Bangladesh\u2019s exports in December rose 8.4 percent from a year earlier to $3.35 billion, boosted by stronger garment sales, official data showed on Thursday.  For July-December, the first half of the 2017-18 financial year, exports rose 7.15 percent from a year earlier to $17.9 billion, the Export Promotion Bureau said.  Shipments of key garments, comprising knitwear and woven items, totalled $14.8 billion in July-December, up 7.75 percent from a year earlier.  Garments are the main foreign-exchange earner for the South Asian country, where low wages and duty-free access to Western markets have helped make it the world\u2019s second-largest apparel exporter after China.  The government has set an export target of $37.5 billion for the 2017-18 financial year, with ready-made garments earning $30.16 billion.  Bangladesh is on track to achieve the target, say garment exporters.  They say buyers are happy with the reforms in the sector and that there was no impact on orders or shipments from a July 2016 attack on a cafe in Dhaka\u2019s diplomatic quarter in which 22 people were killed, mostly foreigners.  The garment industry had been recovering strongly from a major tragedy four years ago, when a factory building collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people and prompting safety checks that led to factory closures and the loss of exports and jobs.  Exports in the previous financial year to June rose 1.7 percent from a year earlier to $34.7 billion, but that was the slowest growth in 15 years, with garment sales up just 0.2 percent.  For the lacklustre growth in the previous financial year, exporters blamed a number of factors, including sluggish demand in main markets, structural reforms in the garment sector, a weak euro and appreciation of the Bangladeshi currency against the dollar.  The central bank left key interest rates unchanged in July, saying it was trying to balance economic growth and inflation risks.  Bangladesh\u2019s economic growth hit a record 7.28 percent in the 2016-17 financial year, while the government aims to boost it to 7.4 percent in the current financial year.

Aurora\u2019s growth plan comes at a time when Canada is set to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana by July, becoming the second country in the world to do so after Uruguay.  Tomato and pepper - often grown in greenhouses - are the most common choices to convert to weed as they have similar growth requirements. The joint venture, which is majority owned by Aurora Cannabis, will focus on selling cannabis in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland, through Aurora\u2019s German unit.  The newly formed company, Aurora Nordic Cannabis A/S, will set up a production facility, which can produce up to 120,000 kg of cannabis per year, Aurora said.

Penney Co Inc said on Thursday same-store sales during the key selling months of November and December rose 3.4 percent, driven by strong demand for home goods, beauty products and jewelry.  The performance bodes well for a sector that has been struggling for years under the combined weight of Amazon.com and falling foot traffic at malls.  Shares of J.C. Penney, which also re-affirmed its full-year 2017 forecast, were up nearly 7 percent in premarket trading. Rival Macy\u2019s Inc rose 1.3 percent, while Kohl\u2019s was also up.  J.C. Penney\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of a MasterCard analytics report that said shoppers spent a record $800 billion during the 2017 U.S. holiday shopping period, on the back of surging consumer confidence and increased use of mobile devices.  To stay relevant, brick-and-mortar retailers including J.C. Penney have been heavily investing in technology and logistics to provide free delivery and returns services.  Penney said its e-ecommerce business sales rose in the double-digits on a percentage basis in the two months compared to the same period last year, largely driven by gifting items such as fine jewelry, luggage, toys, boots and athletic footwear.  Separately, Victoria\u2019s Secret owner L Brands Inc said its same-store sales for the five-weeks ended Dec. 30 rose 1 percent.  The company, however, said it would now report fourth-quarter adjusted profit of $2.00 per share, compared with its previous forecast of $1.95-$2.10 per share, sending its shares down 11 percent premarket.  Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $2.05 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)"

          "body": "* Wall Street banks pay more than British rivals  * EU rules succeed in trimming biggest bonuses  * 13 banks paid average $1 million to top staff in 2016  By Lawrence White  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs paid their top bankers in Britain an average of $1.5 million each in 2016, compared with $1 million for local rivals HSBC and Barclays, data released by the banks last year shows.  Data compiled by Reuters from 13 banks\u2019 filings, some of which were released only late last month, shows they paid an average of $1.06 million to such staff in 2016, down from $2 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013 when new European Union rules aimed at curbing banker bonuses took effect.  The Wall Street banks\u2019 higher pay packages show how they have bounced back more quickly from the financial crisis than their peers in Britain, some of which have faced hefty post-crisis costs that have limited banker pay.  The data also shows that EU rules to rein in banker bonuses, blamed for driving excessive risk-taking in the run up to the 2008 crisis, are having an impact.  JPMorgan paid 672 staff in senior or risk-taking positions a total of $1.02 billion in 2016 for an average of $1.52 million each, while 724 Goldman bankers took home an average of $1.48 million each, according to Reuters\u2019 calculations from the filings.  U.S. banks were also able to capitalise more effectively than European rivals on spikes in volatility in financial markets in 2016 from Britain\u2019s June Brexit vote.  Europe\u2019s top investment banks\u2019 trading in fixed income products fell by 6 percent in the second quarter of 2016, while their five biggest U.S. rivals reported a 21 percent increase to $13.1 billion in revenue from the same business.  The disclosures are among the most comprehensive released on bankers\u2019 pay in Britain, which remains a controversial subject ten years on from the financial crisis.  A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development released on Thursday showed that a median worker salary in Britain is about $38,493. In contrast, the average pay of a senior banker in 2016 was $1.06 million.  The report highlighted that the average boss of one of Britain\u2019s top companies will by Thursday have already earned the same as the typical worker will make in the entire year.  The banks\u2019 pay disclosures make no mention of gender pay gaps, but banks in Britain may have to begin reporting such data after the government last April announced employers would have to disclose the difference between what they pay men and women by April 2018.  The average pay levels for bankers in the filings were boosted by a handful of top earners, with 10 Goldman bankers earning the highest band of more than 9 million euros in 2016 while 14 JPMorgan executives took home that lender\u2019s top bracket of over 5 million euros each.  The pay disclosures focus on banks\u2019 senior executives and \u2018material risk takers\u2019, and show how an EU rule that came into force in 2014 capping variable or bonus pay at 200 percent of fixed pay has cut fat bonuses.  While Goldman Sachs paid senior staff more than five times more in variable pay than fixed in 2013, before the rule took effect, that ratio fell in 2016 to 0.6 times.  Goldman in 2016 paid the top bankers $679 million in cash, and gave them 1.63 million shares in the bank which were worth a total of $389.6 million based on the bank\u2019s year-end share price of $239.  Analysis of the filings also shows how regulators have sought to broaden the number of bankers deemed material risk takers, with the total whose pay is captured by the data rising from 2,604 in 2013 to 8,360 in 2016.  The disclosures cover British banks globally and overseas banks\u2019 British-based staff, and contain more detail than is found in pay disclosures in other non-EU regions.  Most banks released the details earlier last year, but some banks such as Goldman reported last month just before the year-end deadline.  Goldman declined to comment.  Reporting By Lawrence White.

          "body": "* Futures up: Dow 72 pts, S&P 3.5 pts, Nasdaq 11.5 pts  By Sruthi Shankar  Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to breach the 25,000 mark for the first time on Thursday as upbeat economic data from around the world boosted sentiment.  Dow futures were trading 50 points short of the mark. The blue-chip index crossed 20,000 in early 2017, spurred by President Donald Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda.  At 6:54 a.m. ET (1154 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 72 points, or 0.29 percent, with 18,013 contracts changing hands.  S&P 500 e-minis were up 3.5 points, or 0.13 percent, with 98,977 contracts traded. The index closed above the 2,700 mark on Wednesday.  Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 11.5 points, or 0.17 percent, on volume of 19,612 contracts.  World stocks hit record on Thursday, driven by strong manufacturing and services sector data in major economies and the Federal Reserve affirming its view of gradual interest rate hikes this year.  The ADP National Employment Report, due at 8:15 a.m. ET, is expected to show that U.S. private employers added 190,000 jobs in December, in line with additions in November.  The more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday is expected to show the economy added 190,000 jobs in December, down from the 228,000 additions in November.  A report on the weekly jobless claims and Markit\u2019s final U.S. Composite Purchasing Managers Index for December are also scheduled for release on Thursday.  Oil rose further above $68 a barrel to the highest since May 2015, supported by unrest in Iran, cold weather in the United States boosting demand and OPEC-led output cuts.  The Cboe Volatility Index, a widely followed measure of market anxiety, was at 9, just above the life low of 8.56.  Among stocks, Teva Pharmaceuticals rose 2.56 percent premarket after Citigroup upgraded the Israeli drugmaker\u2019s stock to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201csell\u201d.  Tesla\u2019s shares fell about 3 percent after the electric car maker delayed a production target for its new Model 3 sedan for the second time.  J.C. Penney rose 5.4 percent after the department store operator said its same-store sales during the key selling months of November and December rose 3.4 percent.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former U.S. National Security Agency contractor has agreed to plead guilty to stealing classified information, according to court filings on Wednesday, in what may have been the largest heist of U.S. government secrets in history.  Harold Martin is scheduled to plead guilty to one count of willful retention of national defense information at a federal court in Baltimore on Jan. 22, according to the filings.  Prosecutors said Martin, who was indicted last February, spent up to 20 years stealing highly sensitive government material from the U.S. intelligence community related to national defense, collecting a trove of secrets he hoarded at his home in Glen Burnie, Maryland.  Authorities said they seized 50 terabytes of data from Martin\u2019s home, which officials said could be the biggest theft of classified information in U.S. history.  The government has not said what, if anything, Martin did with the stolen data.  He faces up to 10 years in prison on the single count. Martin has not struck a plea deal with prosecutors and could still be tried on the remaining 19 counts in the indictment, the court filings said.  A lawyer for Martin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The NSA has been hit by a series of damaging data breaches in recent years.  In December, former NSA employee Nghia Hoang Pho pleaded guilty to illegally taking classified information that an intelligence official said was later stolen from his home computer by Russian hackers.   Martin worked for Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp when he was taken into custody in August 2016.  Booz Allen also employed Edward Snowden, who leaked a trove of secret files to news organizations in 2013 that exposed vast domestic and international surveillance operations carried out by the NSA.  Martin was employed as a private contractor by at least seven companies, working for several government agencies beginning in 1993 after serving in the U.S. Navy for four years, according to the indictment.  His positions, which involved work on highly classified projects involving government computer systems, gave him various security clearances that routinely provided him access to top-secret information, it said.  The indictment also alleged that Martin stole documents from U.S. Cyber Command, the CIA and the National Reconnaissance Office.  Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Peter Cooney"

          "body": "GENEVA (Reuters) - At least 471 people in Yemen are believed to have been infected with diphtheria, killing one in 10 of them since the outbreak began in mid-August, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday.  Yemen, one of the Arab world\u2019s poorest countries, is embroiled in a proxy war between the Houthi armed movement, allied with Iran, and a U.S.-backed military coalition headed by Saudi Arabia.   The United Nations calls Yemen the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, with 8 million people on the brink of famine.  Ibb and Al-Hodeidah governorates are the hardest hit by diphtheria, spread through close physical and respiratory contact, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in response to a query.  \u201cThe overall case fatality\u00a0ratio is\u00a010 percent,\u201d he said, noting that 46 fatalities had been recorded as of Jan. 2.  The Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen on Tuesday denied blocking aid and basic supplies from entering, following a Reuters story detailing how Yemen is struggling to cope with the diphtheria outbreak.  The Reuters Special Report, published on Dec 29, said that in the past four months, doctors across Yemen had recorded at least 380 cases of diphtheria, a bacterial disease that last appeared in the country in 1992.  The spread of diphtheria - which can be prevented by vaccine - compounds widespread hunger and one of the worst cholera outbreaks ever recorded, with more than 1 million cases and  2,227 deaths since April.  The WHO, a U.N. agency, has delivered antibiotics and vials of diphtheria antitoxin to affected areas and is helping establish treatment centers.   Along with UNICEF, it has vaccinated children around Ibb against the disease.   Yemen\u2019s health system has virtually collapsed, with chronic shortages of medical supplies, low immunization rates and most health workers unpaid throughout the war.

Shares in the 240-year-old company slumped as much as 24 percent after the mid-market retailer rushed out sales figures a week earlier than expected.  Its performance underlines the threat to traditional British retailers from online competition, a decline in demand for clothing and pressure on consumer spending.  Chief Executive Sergio Bucher said customers had \u201ccome late to Christmas\u201d, and when they did start shopping its gifts were not special enough to encourage them to buy without discounts.  \u201cGifting has become very promotional,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIn hindsight, if I\u2019d do anything different I think my gifting pipeline would be more premium and differentiated.\u201d  Debenhams is second ranked in department stores by sales value to John Lewis, which said on Wednesday its sales in the week before Christmas rose 8.9 percent.  Bucher said a raspberry-flavoured gin flew off the shelves, but lower priced items at Debenhams such as cards and decorations did not appeal.  It held its ground in a declining clothing market, he added, and stronger demand for beauty and food helped drive a 1.2 percent rise in like-for-like sales in the six weeks before Christmas.  But shoppers did not return for the post-Christmas sale, resulting in more price cuts and a further dent to margins.  Trade in September and October had also been poor, contributing to an overall 2.6 percent fall in underlying British sales in the 17 weeks to 30 December.  Bucher, a former Amazon and Inditex executive, who joined Debenhams in 2016, set out a plan to revive the company in April, centered on closing a few stores, revamping others, cutting promotions and improving its online offer.  He said on Thursday the strategy would be implemented more quickly, with another 10 million pounds of cost cuts largely from central functions that would entail some job losses.  \u201cWe need to get there quicker because business as usual will not make us successful in the future,\u201d he said.  The group, which trades from over 240 stores across 27 countries, has already identified 10 stores that could become loss-making and subsequently closed.  Its shares were trading almost 16 percent at 30 pence at 1225 GMT, weighing on fellow retailers such as Marks & Spencer , just a day after an upbeat statement from Next raised hopes that retailers had defied forecasts for gloomy Christmas trading.  Broker Peel Hunt downgraded Debenhams to \u201csell\u201d from \u201chold\u201d after the warning but cautioned against trying to read too much into it.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t a retailing or macro issue, this is all about Debenhams,\u201d their analysts said. \u201cWe believe the customer proposition is simply not compelling enough.\u201d  The share price fall netted estimated profits of around 12 million pounds on Thursday for hedge funds \u201cshorting\u201d, or betting against the stock, according to Reuters calculations.  Eight hedge funds, including Blackrock and Odey Asset Management, have short positions totalling 14.3 percent of the company \u2013 the second highest on any UK stock, according to filings from UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority. Debenhams biggest shareholder is Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct , which holds 21 percent. Its shares were down 2 percent.  The price cuts took a toll on its margins, with gross margin seen down by about 150 basis points in the first half, far below its target of a 25 basis point fall for the year to September 2018. It said its profit before tax for the year was now likely to be in the range of 55-65 million pounds ($74-88 million).  Debenhams reported underlying profit before tax of 95 million pounds last year and analysts had been expecting a figure of 83 million pounds in 2018, according to Reuters data.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., noted in July that the commission was an advisory body that lacked legal authority to compel states to hand over data.

The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six major rivals, had slipped to its lowest since Sept. 20 on Tuesday, as optimism about the euro zone economy drove the single currency above $1.20 for the first time in 3-1/2 months.  The dollar was given some reprieve on Wednesday, bouncing after strong manufacturing and construction data. It gained further support from the Fed\u2019s latest minutes, which indicated the central bank is still poised to raise interest rates several times this year.  But on Thursday it was back in negative territory, with its index down 0.3 percent on the day, close to Tuesday\u2019s lows.  \u201cThis is just a continuation of the trend we saw into year-end, which was a weaker dollar,\u201d said BMO Capital Markets currency strategist Stephen Gallo, in London.  \u201cWe have decent expectations for global growth and global risk assets and, when you have above-potential global growth, the dollar tends to weaken because people don\u2019t need to hold safe-haven dollars.\u201d  The U.S. currency was slightly higher against the yen, trading up 0.1 percent at 112.61 yen on strong risk appetite across markets. It touched a 2-1/2-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday after declining steadily from a high above 113.750 scaled in December.  After dipping in early trade in Asia, reaching as low as $1.2005, the euro then bounced back to trade as high as $1.2066 , up 0.4 percent on the day and less than half a cent away from highs of $1.2092 seen in December - the strongest since the start of 2015.  \u201cWe see some very positive euro sentiment in the market right now, and if it goes down too much against the U.S. dollar that\u2019s going to begin again ... The market is not confident enough right now that levels below $1.20 are justified,\u201d said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt.  \u201cThat might change with the U.S. employment data coming in strong,\u201d she said, adding that U.S. wages numbers due on Friday could be key in determining the dollar\u2019s direction.  In the minutes from their Dec. 12-13 meeting, Fed policymakers acknowledged the U.S. labour market\u2019s solid gains and the expansion in economic activity, even as they affirmed worries about persistently low inflation.  That suggested the central bank will continue to pursue a gradual approach to raising rates but could hasten the pace if inflation accelerates.  Bitcoin was down about 4 percent on the Bitstamp exchange at around $14,500, having lost more than a quarter of its value since hitting record highs in mid-December.

Yemen, one of the Arab world\u2019s poorest countries, is embroiled in a proxy war between the Houthi armed movement, allied with Iran, and a U.S.-backed military coalition headed by Saudi Arabia.   The United Nations calls Yemen the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, with 8 million people on the brink of famine.  Ibb and Al-Hodeidah governorates are the hardest hit by diphtheria, spread through close physical and respiratory contact, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in response to a query.  \u201cThe overall case fatality\u00a0ratio is\u00a010 percent,\u201d he said, noting that 46 fatalities had been recorded as of Jan. 2.  The Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen on Tuesday denied blocking aid and basic supplies from entering, following a Reuters story detailing how Yemen is struggling to cope with the diphtheria outbreak.  The Reuters Special Report, published on Dec 29, said that in the past four months, doctors across Yemen had recorded at least 380 cases of diphtheria, a bacterial disease that last appeared in the country in 1992.  The spread of diphtheria - which can be prevented by vaccine - compounds widespread hunger and one of the worst cholera outbreaks ever recorded, with more than 1 million cases and  2,227 deaths since April.  The WHO, a U.N. agency, has delivered antibiotics and vials of diphtheria antitoxin to affected areas and is helping establish treatment centers.   Along with UNICEF, it has vaccinated children around Ibb against the disease.   Yemen\u2019s health system has virtually collapsed, with chronic shortages of medical supplies, low immunization rates and most health workers unpaid throughout the war.

          "title": "Column: For U.S. retirees, rising interest rates a double-edged sword",
          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. interest rates finally are on the rise after a decade stuck near zero - and that should be good news for retirees who need yield on safe investments like certificates of deposit and money market accounts.  But higher rates will not be welcome news for all retirees.  Americans are more likely than ever before to enter retirement carrying debt, which leaves them vulnerable to rising interest rates. A recent study coauthored by Olivia S. Mitchell, executive director of the Pension Research Council at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, finds that growing debt obligations of older households leave them vulnerable to rising rates - and that an increasing share of their incomes will need to go to servicing debt.  No doubt, the yields available on savings are showing signs of life after a decade when ultra-low interest rates were a key tool used to stimulate the economy following the Great Recession.   The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates three times last year - most recently in December - and most economists expect several more rate hikes in 2018. Consumer yields on certificates of deposit and money market funds will rise, although not as quickly as loan rates. Still, rate shoppers interested in a one-year CD this week can find deals ranging from 1.65 percent to 1.80 percent, according to Bankrate.com. Three-year deals can be had around 2 percent.  Mitchell\u2019s study is based on data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study. (hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/) She found that the rise of home prices over the past two decades, and the growth of easier mortgage products are key factors driving increasing debt burdens among older households.  \u201cReal estate has played a very important role in this,\u201d she said. \u201cMore expensive houses are a very large factor in the rise of debt. We\u2019re also seeing people with larger mortgages on the larger houses - the old rules of putting down a certain down payment have changed.  Conventional wisdom holds that retirees should shed as much debt as possible - of any kind. But all debt is not equal, and some debt is relatively safe and can improve your liquidity - for example, a low-rate fixed mortgage that represents a relatively small portion of a home\u2019s value and that could be paid off if necessary.  But in the emerging rising-rate environment, a key question is how much debt being carried by older households carries variable rates, leaving borrowers exposed to substantial jumps in rates?  Mitchell\u2019s research suggests that 20 percent of all U.S. consumer debt is variable. The most worrisome figure: 40 percent of households aged 62 to 66 reported carrying credit card debt in 2015. That was down slightly from 2012, when 43 percent of this age group carried credit card debt, but still quite high. Carrying balances on cards is especially dangerous; as the balance grows, interest rates get higher, and credit ultimately is cut off.  One factor driving these numbers is what Mitchell and her colleagues call \u201cfinancial fragility\u201d - the inability to respond to an unexpected financial shock. For example, 36 percent of households aged 56-61 said in 2015 that they could not come up with $2,000 within a month\u2019s time to meet an emergency expense; 23 percent of households 62-66 said the same thing.  Roughly 20 percent of households aged 56 to 61 have unpaid medical bills, reflecting the rising cost of healthcare. \u201cWhen you\u2019re considering whether you\u2019re ready to retire or not, a key thing is to understand is that medical costs are going to be high,\u201d Mitchell said.  She also thinks the debt statistics point to the need for greater financial literacy. Her previous research on this topic measures literacy by posing three basic questions about the workings of compound interest rates, how interest rates interact with inflation and how to avoid stock market risk. Only one-third of test-takers are able to answer all three questions correctly.  But other factors are at work.  Social Security benefits have become less valuable over time as a result of reforms enacted in 1983 and the growing share of benefits consumed by Medicare premiums. Fewer households have access to defined benefit pensions, and many households have not been able to accumulate savings - 47 percent told the Employee Benefit Research Institute last year that their total household savings and investments were less than $25,000.  Retirement stresses are especially acute among older minority households. They are far less likely to have access to workplace retirement saving accounts than their white counterparts, and their rates of home ownership are far lower (reut.rs/2lPezaM).  Taken together, the data underscores the need for a holistic approach to financial planning as retirement draws near - one that balances spending needs with short- and long-term goals. If you are approaching retirement age carrying dangerous debt - a variable mortgage or credit card with a high balance - reorder your financial plan to focus on minimizing or eliminating it. Smart strategies include favoring debt reduction over saving or downsizing your home.  Working longer also can play a big role. More years of earnings not only provide income to pay down debt, but set the stage to maximize your retirement income through delayed filing for Social Security benefits.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Former world number one Andy Murray will miss this month\u2019s Australian Open after failing to recover from the hip injury that has kept him out of action for nearly six months.  Murray, five times a runner-up in Melbourne, has not played a competitive match since hobbling to defeat against American Sam Querrey in the Wimbledon quarter-finals last July.  The 30-year-old\u2019s withdrawal was confirmed by Australian Open organizers who published a statement from the Scot on the tournament\u2019s Twitter account on Thursday.  \u201cSadly I won\u2019t be playing in Melbourne this year, as I am not yet ready to compete,\u201d three-times grand slam champion Murray said. \u201cI\u2019ll be flying home shortly to assess all the options but I appreciate all the messages of support and I hope to be back playing soon.\u201d  Murray played a one-set exhibition match in Abu Dhabi last week, losing to Spain\u2019s Roberto Bautista Agut.  He also played Roger Federer in a charity exhibition match in Scotland in November, but his hopes of playing in the year\u2019s first grand slam nosedived when he withdrew from this week\u2019s Brisbane warm-up event.  Olympic champion Murray has fallen to 16th in the world rankings and will now have to decide whether or not surgery is needed to overcome the hip problem.  \u201cThe chances of a successful outcome are not as I high as I would like which has made (surgery) my secondary option and my hope has been to avoid that,\u201d Murray said this week when announcing he would not play in Brisbane.  \u201cHowever, this is something I may have to consider but let\u2019s hope not.\u201d  Murray underwent back surgery at the end of 2013 but returned to play some of his best tennis and won a second Wimbledon title in 2016 and reached number one in the world rankings for the first time.  That effort took its toll on Murray in 2017 as he won only one title.  He joins Kei Nishikori on the absent list for this year\u2019s Australian Open after the Japanese withdrew to continue his rehabilitation on a wrist injury.  Several other players, including world number one Rafael Nadal and six-times Melbourne Park champion Novak Djokovic are battling to be fit for the Australian Open.  \u201cWe are fully aware that Andy has been going through a difficult period with his hip and that he\u2019s done everything possible to prepare for the Australian summer,\u201d Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said.  \u201cPersonally, I also know that Andy loves tennis and would do anything to play. This is a very hard decision for Andy and we totally respect it.\u201d  Tiley was confident that Djokovic (elbow) and Nadal (knee) would be ready for the Jan. 15 start in Melbourne.  \u201cI spoke to Novak. He\u2019s already got every hour of the day planned between when he arrives and the start of the Australian Open. He\u2019ll be ready,\u201d Tiley said.  \u201c(Rafa\u2019s) on his way down here now so he\u2019ll be ready. It\u2019s not dissimilar from last year...Last year we were talking about the health of Rafa Nadal, Roger Federer and Serena Williams and two weeks later they were playing each other in the final.\u201d  Reporting by Martyn Herman and Hardik Vyas; editing by Amlan Chakraborty and Pritha Sarkar"

          "title": "Top-selling German newspaper says new online hate speech law must be scrapped",
          "body": " (Attention: strong language in eighth paragraph)  By Michelle Martin  BERLIN (Reuters) - A new law meant to curtail hate speech on social media in Germany is stifling free speech and making martyrs out of anti-immigrant politicians whose posts are deleted, the top-selling Bild newspaper said on Thursday.  The law which took effect on Jan. 1 can impose fines of up to 50 million euros ($60 million) on sites that fail to remove hate speech promptly. Twitter has deleted anti-Muslim and anti-migrant posts by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and blocked a satirical account that parodied Islamophobia.  \u201cPlease spare us the thought police!\u201d read a headline in Wednesday\u2019s Bild above an article that called the law a \u201csin\u201d against freedom of opinion enshrined in Germany\u2019s constitution.  The law requires social media sites to delete or block obviously criminal content within 24 hours but Bild Editor-in-Chief Julian Reichelt said it could be applied against anything and anyone since there was no definition of what was \u201cmanifestly unlawful\u201d in most cases.  Intended to prevent radical groups from gaining influence, it was having precisely the opposite effect, he said.  \u201cThe law against online hate speech failed on its very first day. It should be abolished immediately,\u201d Reichelt wrote, adding that the law was turning AfD politicians into \u201copinion martyrs\u201d.  Among the tweets deleted was one by AfD lawmaker Beatrix von Storch criticizing police for tweeting in Arabic, saying they had sought \u201cto appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men\u201d. Police have since asked prosecutors to investigate her for possible incitement to hatred.  A deleted tweet by another AfD member of parliament, Jens Maier, called Noah Becker - the son of former tennis champion Boris Becker - a \u201chalf-nigger\u201d.  Justice Minister Heiko Maas defended the law, telling Bild that freedom of opinion did not mean carte blanche to spread criminal content on the internet.  \u201cCalls to murder, threats, insults and incitement of the masses or Auschwitz lies are not an expression of freedom of  opinion but rather attacks on the freedom of opinion of others,\u201d he said.  Germany has some of the world\u2019s toughest laws on defamation, incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities.  Maas said social networks needed to stick to the law like everyone else, adding: \u201cThose who care about protecting freedom of opinion can\u2019t just look on as criminal incitement and threats inhibit the open exchange of views.\u201d  Reporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"

          "body": "* China bans under-the-table transactions that skirt rules  * Beijing sets \u201csoft\u201d caps on repo, reverse repo trading volume  * Changes underscore coordinated efforts to cut financial leverage (Updates to change sourcing)  SHANGHAI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - China released new rules tightening bond trading regulations on Thursday, with a focus on restricting leverage and banning under-the-table deals.  The regulations, jointly issued by the People\u2019s Bank of China and China\u2019s banking, securities and insurance regulators, come as Beijing launches a series of co-ordinated initiatives across government agencies designed to reduce leverage in the financial system.  Under the new rules, published on the central bank\u2019s website, institutions must sign written deals when conducting bond repurchase or bond forward transactions. Any deals designed to dodge regulatory requirements are to be banned.  The rules order financial institutions to report financial data to regulators if their outstanding repurchase agreements, known as repos, and reverse repo volumes exceed a certain limit.  A version of the rules seen by Reuters earlier on Thursday and confirmed to be authentic by three sources was dated Dec. 29. The document posted on the PBOC\u2019s website did not include a specific date but carried the year 2017.  China is escalating a campaign to reduce excessive leverage in the banking system that threatens financial stability.  In November, Beijing formally set up its State Council Financial Stability and Development Committee to strengthen financial supervision. In the same month, the central bank drafted sweeping rules to tighten supervision of the country\u2019s $9 trillion asset management industry to curb shadow banking.  \u201cAll these measures are aimed at deleveraging, and preventing systemic risks in the financial industry, after years of aggressive expansion by financial institutions,\u201d said Zhang Zibing, chief investment officer at Shanghai-based asset manager Bona Capital.  \u201cBanks must change their mentality, both in their growth models, and in how they allocate their assets,\u201d Zhang said, adding he expects bond yields to remain elevated this year.  Yields of China\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bonds climbed steadily in 2017, and on Thursday hovered around the highest level in three years, at 3.937 percent.  By publishing the rules, regulators are seeking to avoid a repeat of the $2.4 billion bond scandal involving Chinese brokerage Sealand Securities in late 2016, which triggered panic across the country\u2019s financial markets.  Although Sealand Securities blamed \u201cforged\u201d bond agreements, analysts largely pointed to a popular practice called \u201cdaichi\u201d, which is Chinese for \u201cpledged financing\u201d and works in a similar manner to repo agreements, although such transactions are made through informal, oral agreements.  The new rules would effectively terminate the practice, which traders have used to keep increased leverage off the regulatory radar.  They would also restrict leverage by setting a cap on repo or reserve transactions, tools which help some institutions channel short-term borrowings into longer-term assets for profit.  For deposit-taking institutions, if the outstanding volume of such transactions exceeds 80 percent of their net assets, they need to report their financial data to regulators.  The cap is 120 percent for securities firms, fund houses and futures brokerages. For insurers, the limit is set at 20 percent of their total assets.  The rules called on bond market participants to reasonably control leverage ratios on bond trading and strictly abide by liquidity, leverage and ratio requirements.

          "body": "CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A garment worker\u2019s death, after her head and hand got stuck in a machine, highlights a tragic lack of safety at factories in south India that produce for global brands, campaigners said Thursday.  Bhuvaneshwari Adimulam, 20, was working the night shift at a knitwear factory in Tirupur, a district in the \u201ctextile valley\u201d area of Tamil Nadu, when the accident happened early Wednesday, according to police.  Adimulam had begun employment as a temporary worker only last month, officer R. Ramesh told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone.   He did not disclose the name of the factory or any brands it produces for, but said that a case of death due to negligence had been filed against the owner.  Labor campaigners say that injuries are frequent among the approximately 400,000 employees of more than 1,500 factories in Tamil Nadu, the biggest hub for textile manufacturers in India.  \u201cCases of hair, clothes and fingers getting caught in these machines are very common,\u201d said Aloysius Arokiam of Social Awareness and Voluntary Education, a civil society group.  First time workers are expected to \u201cwatch and learn\u201d from their peers and often receive no further training on machines, he said.   N. Vivekanandan, head of the South India Imported Machine Knitters Association that represents 300 manufacturers, disputed such criticism.   New workers are trained for eight weeks before they are allowed to handle machines that are automated to \u201cstop even if there is a thread break\u201d, he said, adding that the circumstances of Adimulam\u2019s death were unclear.  \u201cThis is a very unfortunate incident,\u201d said Vivekanandan.

          "title": "Column: For U.S. retirees, rising interest rates a double-edged sword",
          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. interest rates finally are on the rise after a decade stuck near zero - and that should be good news for retirees who need yield on safe investments like certificates of deposit and money market accounts.  But higher rates will not be welcome news for all retirees.  Americans are more likely than ever before to enter retirement carrying debt, which leaves them vulnerable to rising interest rates. A recent study coauthored by Olivia S. Mitchell, executive director of the Pension Research Council at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, finds that growing debt obligations of older households leave them vulnerable to rising rates - and that an increasing share of their incomes will need to go to servicing debt.  No doubt, the yields available on savings are showing signs of life after a decade when ultra-low interest rates were a key tool used to stimulate the economy following the Great Recession.   The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates three times last year - most recently in December - and most economists expect several more rate hikes in 2018. Consumer yields on certificates of deposit and money market funds will rise, although not as quickly as loan rates. Still, rate shoppers interested in a one-year CD this week can find deals ranging from 1.65 percent to 1.80 percent, according to Bankrate.com. Three-year deals can be had around 2 percent.  Mitchell\u2019s study is based on data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study. (hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/) She found that the rise of home prices over the past two decades, and the growth of easier mortgage products are key factors driving increasing debt burdens among older households.  \u201cReal estate has played a very important role in this,\u201d she said. \u201cMore expensive houses are a very large factor in the rise of debt. We\u2019re also seeing people with larger mortgages on the larger houses - the old rules of putting down a certain down payment have changed.  Conventional wisdom holds that retirees should shed as much debt as possible - of any kind. But all debt is not equal, and some debt is relatively safe and can improve your liquidity - for example, a low-rate fixed mortgage that represents a relatively small portion of a home\u2019s value and that could be paid off if necessary.  But in the emerging rising-rate environment, a key question is how much debt being carried by older households carries variable rates, leaving borrowers exposed to substantial jumps in rates?  Mitchell\u2019s research suggests that 20 percent of all U.S. consumer debt is variable. The most worrisome figure: 40 percent of households aged 62 to 66 reported carrying credit card debt in 2015. That was down slightly from 2012, when 43 percent of this age group carried credit card debt, but still quite high. Carrying balances on cards is especially dangerous; as the balance grows, interest rates get higher, and credit ultimately is cut off.  One factor driving these numbers is what Mitchell and her colleagues call \u201cfinancial fragility\u201d - the inability to respond to an unexpected financial shock. For example, 36 percent of households aged 56-61 said in 2015 that they could not come up with $2,000 within a month\u2019s time to meet an emergency expense; 23 percent of households 62-66 said the same thing.  Roughly 20 percent of households aged 56 to 61 have unpaid medical bills, reflecting the rising cost of healthcare. \u201cWhen you\u2019re considering whether you\u2019re ready to retire or not, a key thing is to understand is that medical costs are going to be high,\u201d Mitchell said.  She also thinks the debt statistics point to the need for greater financial literacy. Her previous research on this topic measures literacy by posing three basic questions about the workings of compound interest rates, how interest rates interact with inflation and how to avoid stock market risk. Only one-third of test-takers are able to answer all three questions correctly.  But other factors are at work.  Social Security benefits have become less valuable over time as a result of reforms enacted in 1983 and the growing share of benefits consumed by Medicare premiums. Fewer households have access to defined benefit pensions, and many households have not been able to accumulate savings - 47 percent told the Employee Benefit Research Institute last year that their total household savings and investments were less than $25,000.  Retirement stresses are especially acute among older minority households. They are far less likely to have access to workplace retirement saving accounts than their white counterparts, and their rates of home ownership are far lower (reut.rs/2lPezaM).  Taken together, the data underscores the need for a holistic approach to financial planning as retirement draws near - one that balances spending needs with short- and long-term goals. If you are approaching retirement age carrying dangerous debt - a variable mortgage or credit card with a high balance - reorder your financial plan to focus on minimizing or eliminating it. Smart strategies include favoring debt reduction over saving or downsizing your home.  Working longer also can play a big role. More years of earnings not only provide income to pay down debt, but set the stage to maximize your retirement income through delayed filing for Social Security benefits.

          "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A Berlin court on Thursday rebuffed a legal challenge to the insolvency filing of airline Niki, which could derail the sale of the Air Berlin (AB1.DE) unit to Britain\u2019s IAG (ICAG.L), and referred the case to a higher court for a ruling.  Niki filed for insolvency in Berlin last month after Germany\u2019s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) scrapped plans to buy the Austrian unit, grounding the airline\u2019s fleet and stranding thousands of passengers.  Following hurried talks to find a new owner for Niki before it loses its valuable runway slots, British Airways owner IAG agreed last Friday to buy the business and make it part of its low-cost unit Vueling.  But Fairplane, a group representing airline passengers, said on Tuesday it had filed legal cases to have the insolvency proceedings for Niki shifted to Austria from Germany, which could unravel the sale.  Fairplane argues Niki, which is registered as a company in Austria, had been profitable but lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December.  The Charlottenburg court said on Thursday it still believed that Niki was in its jurisdiction because its \u201ccenter of main interest\u201d was in Berlin, where parent Air Berlin was based, according to a statement by Berlin\u2019s civil courts.  \u201cThe debtor (Niki) appeared to its business partners in a manner that showed it subordinated its corporate identity to Air Berlin PLC & Co. Luftverkehrs KG,\u201d the statement said.  Also, passengers who booked tickets for Niki flights entered a contract with the parent, Air Berlin, it said.  The higher court, Berlin\u2019s regional court, will rule on the matter shortly, the statement said, without being more specific.  IAG declined to comment on the matter.

          "body": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland\u2019s largest and wealthiest canton saw a three-fold rise in the number of tax cheats turning themselves in during 2017, Zurich officials said on Thursday, as an international accord to share information on offshore wealth takes effect.  The finance department said 6,150 Zurich taxpayers came clean on previously undisclosed assets in 2017, tripling the previous record set in 2016 and helping to disclose 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.33 billion) in hidden wealth so far.  The authorities have been able to handle only about half the cases so far, however, so they expect the sum to rise.  Under the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s new Automatic Exchange of Information program, more than 100 countries are beginning to exchange financial information amid a global clampdown on tax evasion.   The agreement aims to ensure offshore accounts are known to authorities in the country where the account holder owes tax.  Switzerland, the world\u2019s biggest center for managing offshore wealth, will get the first information from other countries this year, starting with data collected in 2017.  Switzerland in 2010 introduced a rule letting taxpayers  self-declare untaxed assets one time without facing a fine.  Zurich said its tax office had beefed up staffing in the unit handling self-disclosures, helping double the number of cases it was able to process during the year to 3,800. That included some that had been received at end-2016.  The efforts generated 104 million francs in additional tax revenue.  Meanwhile, the canton of Lucerne said it had generated 15.5 million francs in additional taxes from new self-disclosures last year, seeing an uptick in the number of cases but a decline in the sums each taxpayer declared.  Figures for other cantons were not immediately available.  Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi, Editing by William Maclean"

          "title": "Trump push to scale back welfare programs has Republicans on edge",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Emboldened by his victory in the passage of the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in decades, President Donald Trump now wants to rein in social welfare programs even though some Republicans are wary of tackling the volatile issue in a congressional election year.  A White House-led drive to downsize government aid programs such as food stamps and housing subsidies would energize conservative campaign donors whose support Republicans are counting on ahead of the November elections where the party will fight to keep control of Congress.  White House aides say Trump is eager to take on welfare. He has a willing partner in House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who has long had an interest in the issue.  But some Republicans believe Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is lukewarm on the drive for revising welfare, which might face a difficult sell in the Senate where Republicans hold only a razor-thin 51-49 majority.  Democrats already are attacking Trump for identifying welfare changes as his top 2018 goal, saying they are designed to help pay for tax cuts whose benefits are skewed toward corporations and wealthy individuals and which will add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years.      Trump has summoned Republican congressional leaders to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland this weekend to discuss 2018 priorities, including welfare and a planned effort on infrastructure investment.      Conservative House Republicans are especially enthusiastic about a welfare overhaul. Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows and the caucus\u2019 former leader, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan, have discussed it with Trump and are confident the Republican president backs their ideas, such as strengthening work requirements for food stamps.  \u201cHe definitely gets it,\u201d Jordan said.  But Republicans may need to tread carefully in seeking to reduce government aid programs that benefit some of Trump\u2019s core supporters in poor, rural regions of the country.  Republican Representative Tom Cole said Congress had a lot on its plate in the early months of 2018, including must-pass budget legislation and he was unsure there would be the time - or political will in the Senate - to pass welfare legislation.  \u201cFirst things first,\u201d Cole said, adding it might be better to lay the groundwork for debate over the issue than to try enacting changes this year.  Meadows said he believed a welfare overhaul had strong support among Republican lawmakers but that \u201cconvincing Mitch McConnell and the Democrats are Herculean tasks.\u201d  Other Republicans and interest groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers think 2018 would be better spent on infrastructure.  Trump\u2019s first major legislative victory - the tax bill - took until the end of 2017. But handing out tax breaks might be far easier than revamping welfare assistance that benefits millions of American families.  Last year, there were more than 42 million people in nearly 21 million U.S. households receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, which are known as food stamps, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  They cost taxpayers about $58 billion.  Trump\u2019s budget proposal last year called for cutting more than $192 billion from SNAP over a decade.  The president also proposed deep cuts to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which last year provided aid to 1.1 million families.  Democratic strategist Doug Thornell said a push on welfare could trigger a political backlash for Republicans from elderly and blue-collar voters in the November congressional elections.  Thornell said it may appeal to Trump\u2019s political base \u201cbut few else. And the irony here is that it will be Trump\u2019s base who will feel the brunt of these cuts.\u201d      Robert Doar, a poverty specialist at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute who has been in contact with Trump administration officials about policy ideas, urged an incremental approach.  Although Doar said he did not know what policies the administration would ultimately back, he said Trump could encourage people to get jobs by reducing the length of their qualification for government aid and imposing stricter reviews of their efforts to find work.  He said Congress could pass legislation cutting benefits for people who fail to make enough effort to find jobs or do volunteer work.  Some have argued that food stamp beneficiaries, for example, already include a high rate of people who hold jobs but are unable to make ends meet.

          "body": "TORONTO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Initial public offerings by Canadian companies are expected to increase in 2018, driven by activity in industrials, alternative energy and base metals sectors, banking advisers said.  Companies raised C$4.6 billion ($3.7 billion) through IPOs in Canada in 2017, marking a surge in activity following a lull the previous year, according to numbers from Thomson Reuters that were released on Thursday. There were 22 IPOs, the highest for Canada since 2013.  Global equity markets have been climbing, generating a positive climate for company flotations, despite uncertainty around trade deals and the political environment.  \u201cThe markets are very much shrugging off all of these risks right now and maintaining quite a bit of calm and optimism,\u201d said Peter Miller, co-head of global equity capital markets at BMO. \u201cThe IPO market looks more attractive versus the M&A alternative.\u201d  With asset valuations at elevated levels, private equity firms are looking to monetize their investments, often choosing between an IPO and a sale.  Reuters has reported that private equity-owned Canadian waste management company GFL Environmental Inc is looking to raise as much as C$1 billion in an IPO this year and Onex Corp-backed wood pellets producer Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc is set to list in Toronto.  Kirby Gavelin, head of equity capital markets at RBC, said he was bullish on Canadian equities activity in 2018.  Gavelin said he expects to see companies in the energy and mining sectors file to go public if prices hold up, following last year\u2019s IPO from oil pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd that raised C$1.75 billion.  \u201cThe environment is right, the volatility is low, and there is a good supply of quality names,\u201d said Benoit Lauz\u00e9, head of equity capital markets at CIBC, who was an advisor on the wildly successful Canada Goose offering in 2017. \u201cI feel really good about the IPO market.\u201d  Some bankers said there was a scarcity value for quality private Canadian companies with a potential to tap the market.  \u201cCanadian investors continue to look for opportunities and high-growth companies,\u201d said Darin Deschamps, co-head of Wells Fargo Securities Canada. \u201cThey are on the lookout for new stories.\u201d ($1 = 1.2529 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by John Tilak and Matt Scuffham; Editing by Jim Finkle and Rosalba O\u2019Brien)"

          "body": "TORONTO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Rising equity markets and clarity on U.S. tax reform could set the stage for an acceleration in Canadian mergers and acquisitions this year after a slowdown in 2017, investment bankers said.  Canadian M&A activity slipped 6 percent in 2017 to $239.7 billion, from $255.1 billion in the previous year, data from Thomson Reuters showed on Thursday.  While uncertainty around the tax regime weighed on deal activity in 2017, bankers expect the recently passed changes to the U.S. tax system to boost the allure of U.S. companies to Canadian firms and funds looking to make acquisitions.  Following a sweeping overhaul under President Donald Trump, the U.S. corporate income tax rate has been cut to 21 percent from 35 percent.  With Canadian and U.S. stocks at record highs, bankers also see buoyant equity markets supporting deals.  \u201cWe expect 2018 to be a very strong year for M&A,\u201d said Darin Deschamps, co-head of Wells Fargo Securities Canada.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got healthy economies in Canada and the United States, corporate liquidity is very robust, the banking system wants to lend, and the financing markets are very attractive,\u201d Deschamps said.  Still, the lack of visibility around negotiations over renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement has been holding back some potential buyers. Some experts expect the NAFTA situation to be resolved in the first half of the year.  \u201cThere is a desire to do deals, but it\u2019s a more difficult environment to find value in certain sectors as NAFTA negotiations add a certain level of uncertainty,\u201d said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada.  Some bankers said they see Trump\u2019s threat to pull out of NAFTA if the talks fail as an opportunity for Canadian companies.  \u201cThe risks around the continuation of the existing NAFTA agreement necessitates companies to undertake M&A to try and position themselves in a potential post-NAFTA world,\u201d said Grant Kernaghan, Citigroup\u2019s managing director of Canadian investment banking.  In this environment, Kernaghan expects Canadian companies to acquire U.S. targets in the automotive, paper and telecommunication equipment sectors.  Pension funds, among the world\u2019s most active dealmakers, are expected to fuel deal activity as they look to invest massive capital pools.  \u201cThe pension funds have such a large amount of money that they need to deploy on behalf of the beneficiaries that they really have to be looking at a lot of different opportunities,\u201d said Peter Buzzi, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at \u200eRBC Capital Markets.  Last year saw a decline in outbound deals, after they peaked in 2015 and 2016. Some of the year\u2019s biggest transactions were domestic companies picking up assets, including Cenovus Energy Inc\u2019s C$16.8 billion acquisition of some ConocoPhillips assets.  \u201cThe market sentiment for M&A has definitely picked up over the course of 2017,\u201d said Geoff Barsky, BMO\u2019s head of Canadian and international M&A. \u201cWe anticipate increased levels of outbound activity going into 2018.\u201d (Reporting by John Tilak; Additional reporting by Matt Scuffham in Toronto; Editing by Jim Finkle and Tom Brown)"

The finance department said 6,150 Zurich taxpayers came clean on previously undisclosed assets in 2017, tripling the previous record set in 2016 and helping to disclose 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.33 billion) in hidden wealth so far.  The authorities have been able to handle only about half the cases so far, however, so they expect the sum to rise.  Under the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s new Automatic Exchange of Information program, more than 100 countries are beginning to exchange financial information amid a global clampdown on tax evasion.   The agreement aims to ensure offshore accounts are known to authorities in the country where the account holder owes tax.  Switzerland, the world\u2019s biggest center for managing offshore wealth, will get the first information from other countries this year, starting with data collected in 2017.  Switzerland in 2010 introduced a rule letting taxpayers  self-declare untaxed assets one time without facing a fine.  Zurich said its tax office had beefed up staffing in the unit handling self-disclosures, helping double the number of cases it was able to process during the year to 3,800. That included some that had been received at end-2016.  The efforts generated 104 million francs in additional tax revenue.  Meanwhile, the canton of Lucerne said it had generated 15.5 million francs in additional taxes from new self-disclosures last year, seeing an uptick in the number of cases but a decline in the sums each taxpayer declared.

          "body": "FRANKFURT/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Security researchers on Wednesday disclosed a set of security flaws that they said could let hackers steal sensitive information from nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.  One of the bugs is specific to Intel but another affects laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets and internet servers alike. Intel and ARM insisted that the issue was not a design flaw, but it will require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix.  \u201cPhones, PCs, everything are going to have some impact, but it\u2019ll vary from product to product,\u201d Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday afternoon.   Researchers with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Project Zero, in conjunction with academic and industry researchers from several countries, discovered two flaws.  The first, called Meltdown, affects Intel chips and lets hackers bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer\u2019s memory, potentially letting hackers read a computer\u2019s memory and steal passwords. The second, called Spectre, affects chips from Intel, AMD and ARM and lets hackers potentially trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information.  The researchers said Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp had patches ready for users for desktop computers affected by Meltdown. Microsoft declined to comment and Apple did not immediately return requests for comment.  Daniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered Meltdown, called it \u201cprobably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found\u201d in an interview with Reuters.  Gruss said Meltdown was the more serious problem in the short term but could be decisively stopped with software patches. Spectre, the broader bug that applies to nearly all computing devices, is harder for hackers to take advantage of but less easily patched and will be a bigger problem in the long term, he said.  Speaking on CNBC, Intel\u2019s Krzanich said Google researchers told Intel of the flaws \u201ca while ago\u201d and that Intel had been testing fixes that device makers who use its chips will push out next week. Before the problems became public, Google on its blog said Intel and others planned to disclose the issues on Jan. 9. Google said it informed the affected companies about the \u201cSpectre\u201d flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the \u201cMeltdown\u201d flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017.  The flaws were first reported by tech publication The Register. It also reported that the updates to fix the problems could causes Intel chips to operate 5 percent to 30 percent more slowly. (bit.ly/2CsRxkj)  Intel denied that the patches would bog down computers based on Intel chips.  \u201cIntel has begun providing software and firmware updates to mitigate these exploits,\u201d Intel said in a statement. \u201cContrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.\u201d  ARM spokesman Phil Hughes said that patches had already been shared with the companies\u2019 partners, which include many smartphone manufacturers.  \u201cThis method only works if a certain type of malicious code is already running on a device and could at worst result in small pieces of data being accessed from privileged memory,\u201d Hughes said in an email.  AMD chips are also affected by at least one variant of a set of security flaws but that it can be patched with a software update. The company said it believes there \u201cis near zero risk to AMD products at this time.\u201d  Google said in a blog post that Android phones running the latest security updates are protected, as are its own Nexus and Pixel phones with the latest security updates. Gmail users do not need to take any additional action to protect themselves, but users of its Chromebooks, Chrome web browser and many of its Google Cloud services will need to install updates.  Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing service used by businesses, said that most of its internet servers were already patched and the rest were in the process of being patched.  The defect affects the so-called kernel memory on Intel x86 processor chips manufactured over the past decade, The Register reported citing unnamed programmers, allowing users of normal applications to discern the layout or content of protected areas on the chips.  That could make it possible for hackers to exploit other security bugs or, worse, expose secure information such as passwords, thus compromising individual computers or even entire server networks.  Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security consulting firm Trail of Bits, said that businesses should quickly move to update vulnerable systems, saying he expects hackers to quickly develop code they can use to launch attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities. \u201cExploits for these bugs will be added to hacker\u2019s standard toolkits,\u201d said Guido.  Shares in Intel were down by 3.4 percent following the report but nudged back up 1.2 percent to $44.70 in after-hours trading while shares in AMD were up 1 percent to $11.77, shedding many of the gains they had made earlier in the day when reports suggested its chips were not affected.  It was not immediately clear whether Intel would face any significant financial liability arising from the reported flaw.  \u201cThe current Intel problem, if true, would likely not require CPU replacement in our opinion. However the situation is fluid,\u201d Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities in New York said in a note, adding it could hurt the company\u2019s reputation.

          "body": "FRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - Insurers will have to pay claims of around $135 billion for 2017, the most ever, following a spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America, according to a report published on Thursday.  German reinsurer Munich Re (MUVGn.DE), in its annual natural catastrophe review, also said last year\u2019s total losses, including those not insured, were $330 billion, the second-worst in history after 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc in Japan.  Although individual events could not be linked directly to climate change, global warming is playing a role, Munich Re said. It expected more frequent extreme events in future.  \u201cWe have a new normal,\u201d said Ernst Rauch, head of Munich Re\u2019s Corporate Climate Center, which monitors climate change risks.   \u201c2017 was not an outlier,\u201d he said, noting insured losses have surpassed $100 billion multiple times since 2005. \u201cWe must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.\u201d  Last year\u2019s hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the United States and Caribbean, wildfires in California and earthquakes in Mexico destroyed homes, infrastructure and numerous lives.   The disasters also rocked global insurers. Munich Re and Hannover Re (HNRGn.DE) both issued profit warnings.   That dealt a blow to a sector already struggling with thin margins, stiff competition and falling prices.  Munich Re\u2019s tally for the industry comes on the back of other estimates that underscored the severity of 2017.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The global market for oil enters 2018 susceptible to price-hiking geopolitical shocks. Unrest in Iran, which now looks to be dissipating, was an early contender. The next event \u2013 U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s potential rethinking of a 2015 agreement to relax sanctions on the Islamic Republic \u2013 is more likely to cause waves.  One reason the crude price is vulnerable to upsets is because the growing global economy has spurred demand. Supply is also restrained: the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia decided in November to extend production cuts worth 1.8 million barrels per day to the end of 2018. Inventories of the black stuff have fallen closer to the average of the past five years, and exchange data cited by Reuters analysis shows hedge funds are betting strongly on higher prices. Meanwhile, oil futures contracts are showing signs consistent with an undersupplied market.  Iranian protests in which 21 people have died are a serious threat to President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s authority. But short of a 1979-style revolution that upends the government and disrupts production, the country is unlikely to cut output. OPEC obliges the world\u2019s fourth-biggest holder of proven crude reserves to stick to its current 3.8 million barrels per day cap. But Iran will strive to keep pumping, as oil exports help pay for domestic subsidies \u2013 one of the main flashpoints of the protests.  Trump is a bigger threat. The U.S. President is likely to decide by mid-January whether he deems Iran to be in compliance with its 2015 deal, which untied some of the punitive sanctions on the country. Reinstating them could have a big impact. Iranian oil production fell 25 percent between mid-2011 and the end of 2012, when restrictions were enacted in full, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. In the 2012-13 fiscal year the country\u2019s oil and natural gas revenue slumped by 47 percent to $63 billion, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  A step-up in sanctions doesn\u2019t mechanistically guarantee higher prices. U.S. shale production could increase, and the other signatories to the 2015 Iran deal \u2013 China, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and France \u2013\u00a0might not follow Trump\u2019s lead in enforcing new sanctions. Even so, the potential for Iran-related upheaval in the oil market lies in the White House rather than in homegrown protests.

          "body": "FRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - Insurers will have to pay claims of around $135 billion for 2017, the most ever, following a spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America, according to a report published on Thursday.  German reinsurer Munich Re (MUVGn.DE), in its annual natural catastrophe review, also said last year\u2019s total losses, including those not insured, were $330 billion, the second-worst in history after 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc in Japan.  Although individual events could not be linked directly to climate change, global warming is playing a role, Munich Re said. It expected more frequent extreme events in future.  \u201cWe have a new normal,\u201d said Ernst Rauch, head of Munich Re\u2019s Corporate Climate Center, which monitors climate change risks.   \u201c2017 was not an outlier,\u201d he said, noting insured losses have surpassed $100 billion multiple times since 2005. \u201cWe must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.\u201d  Last year\u2019s hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the United States and Caribbean, wildfires in California and earthquakes in Mexico destroyed homes, infrastructure and numerous lives.   The disasters also rocked global insurers. Munich Re and Hannover Re (HNRGn.DE) both issued profit warnings.   That dealt a blow to a sector already struggling with thin margins, stiff competition and falling prices.  Munich Re\u2019s tally for the industry comes on the back of other estimates that underscored the severity of 2017.   In December, Swiss Re (SRENH.S) estimated global insured losses from catastrophes would hit $136 billion in 2017, the third-highest on record for the sector, with the United States hardest hit. That figure is not directly comparable to Munich Re\u2019s estimates as it includes man-made disasters.

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Investment and Demographics Key to EM GDP Growth Potential here LONDON, January 04 (Fitch) New estimates of supply-side potential GDP growth over the next five years highlight the importance of demographic factors and investment rates and place India at the top of the list among the ten largest emerging markets (EMs) covered in Fitch Ratings' Global Economic Outlook (GEO) forecasts. India's projected potential growth is 6.7% per annum (p.a.). China and Indonesia jointly rank second-highest, both with projected potential growth of 5.5% p.a. The estimate for China represents a significant slowdown from recent historical average growth and reflects both a deteriorating demographic outlook and a slowdown in the rate of capital accumulation as the investment rate has declined. Broader measures of productivity growth in China have also slowed since the late 2000's. Turkey's potential growth rate is also projected to be rapid at 4.8% p.a. but this hinges crucially on continued high investment rates, which could be vulnerable to a sustained slowdown in capital inflows. Potential growth in Mexico, Poland and Korea is projected to be lower, in the 2.5% to 3% p.a. range, while South Africa, Brazil and Russia are expected to see supply-side growth potential below 2% p.a. over the next five years. \"Population dynamics are a key supply-side growth driver. For countries such as Mexico and Brazil, and to a less extent South Africa, population growth has been the main or the sole engine of GDP growth historically,\" said Brian Coulton, Chief Economist at Fitch. India in particular, but also Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey and Brazil are set to see continued robust growth in the working-age population in the next five years, bolstering GDP growth potential. In contrast, in Russia, Poland, China and Korea headwinds from deteriorating demographics will sharpen and weigh on growth. Nevertheless, rising labour force participation rates give some grounds for encouragement as they can be a powerful offset to decelerating working-age population growth. For instance, the participation rate has risen steeply in Russia, Korea and Poland over the last 10 years or so. Capital accumulation and investment also have a crucial role in boosting GDP growth. \"China has been the standout country with the highest investment-to-GDP ratio and fastest growth in the capital stock per worker, allowing it to record the strongest improvements in labour productivity and GDP growth over the last three decades,\" added Maxime Darmet-Cucchiarini, Associate Director at Fitch's Economics team. \"However the extremely rapid rise in the investment rate in China after 2008 was associated with a decline in total factor productivity growth,\" added Darmet-Cucchiarini. India and, to a lesser extent, Turkey have also seen an impressive rate of capital accumulation per worker, but in the latter's case this has been funded externally, with associated downside risks. In contrast, in Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, the growth in capital per worker has historically been much more muted. This has weighed on the growth rate of living standards. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth - which captures improvements in the efficiency of the production process - has been subdued in the large EM's in recent years, slowing across virtually all the countries covered in the report. This reinforces the importance of accelerating structural reforms to enhance convergence with advanced economy productivity levels. China, along with Indonesia more recently, have seen the best TFP growth historically and both have made good progress since 2009 in enhancing governance, on the basis of the World Bank's ease of doing business and rule of law measures.  By contrast, Turkey, Brazil, Russia, South Africa and Mexico have seen lacklustre TFP growth. India's TFP performance has also been surprisingly weak given its low level of GDP per capita, while Korea has been the mirror image with strong TFP growth over the last 20 years despite already high income levels.

Martha O\u2019Donovan works for Magamba TV, which describes itself as Zimbabwe\u2019s leading producer of political satire.  She was arrested in November in a dawn raid on her home in the capital after allegedly calling Mugabe, who was ousted in a bloodless coup a few weeks later, a \u201cselfish and sick man\u201d on Twitter.   O\u2019Donovan was first charged with insulting and undermining the president, and subsequently with subversion, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  O\u2019Donovan denied the accusations and had been granted bail in November by Zimbabwe\u2019s High Court, which said there was \u201cpatent absence of facts\u201d in the case and that the state could only bring her back to court when it had new evidence.   On Thursday, magistrate Rumbidzai Mugwagwa dismissed prosecutors\u2019 application to keep O\u2019Donovan on bail.  \u201cFurther remand is denied.

Lawyer Obey Shava told journalists the court had returned computers, cellphones and other electronic devices that had been seized from O\u2019Donovan\u2019s home.  Mugabe had been particularly uneasy about social media after activists such as pastor Evan Mawararire and his #ThisFlag movement in 2016 used social media to organize a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China believes a general election in Cambodia this year will be fair, a senior Chinese official said on Thursday, after the United States and the European Union withdrew support for the vote following the dissolution of the main opposition party.  China is Cambodia\u2019s biggest aid donor and its backing has bolstered its veteran prime minister, Hun Sen, in the face of criticism of over what his opponents say amounts to his destruction of democracy.  \u201cChina respects and supports the development path chosen by the Cambodian people, and believes Cambodia\u2019s future election can, under all sides\u2019 supervision, reflect its fairness and select a party and leader that satisfies the Cambodian people,\u201d Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said.  Kong told a briefing, ahead of a visit by Premier Li Keqiang to Cambodia, that China had offered election support, but did not specify what kind.  Cambodia has said China will provide various equipment for the July election, including ballot boxes and booths.  The United States and EU canceled their planned support following a Cambodian court\u2019s dissolution of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in November at the government\u2019s request.  Kong said China was Cambodia\u2019s largest source of foreign investment, its largest trade partner, and its largest source of foreign tourists.   Li will visit Cambodia on Jan. 10-11, and attend a regional forum there of leaders from six countries, including Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.  Cambodia and China have become increasingly close as a Cambodian government crackdown on its critics, civil society groups and independent media has drawn criticism from Western governments and human rights groups.  Critics called the ban on the CNRP an attempt to steal the election and the death knell for democracy in a country where Western donors have spent billions of dollars since 1993 trying to build a multiparty system after decades of war.  Hun Sen, whose rule of more than 30 years was under threat from the opposition at the election, has said he will stay in power for at least another decade.   China\u2019s President Xi Jinping has vowed that China will not export its political system but it has expanded the reach of its foreign policy and military under Xi.  Hun Sen was among leaders who spoke at a forum of international political parties hosted by Xi and China\u2019s ruling Communist Party in Beijing in December.

The man, surnamed Chen, said the vessel was bound for Hong Kong, despite knowing it was bound for international waters to traffic oil products, the prosecutors\u2019 office in the southern city of Kaohsiung said on Wednesday.  \u201cThe suspicion of crime is great,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that he faced further investigation, but without giving a reason for the decision to grant bail of T$1.5 million ($50,700).   Reuters was unable to reach Chen for comment.   South Korea seized the Hong Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore in late November. A South Korean foreign ministry official said it transferred as much as 600 tonnes of oil to the North Korea-flagged Sam Jong 2 on Oct. 19 in international waters between China and the Korean peninsula, on the order of its Taiwan-based charterer, Billions Bunker Group Corp.  The Lighthouse Winmore is one of 10 vessels the United States has proposed the United Nations Security Council should blacklist for illicit trade with North Korea, according to documents seen by Reuters last month.  The U.N. Security Council last month unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.

          "title": "Trump, Congress face a long to-do list in 2018",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress have set their sights on an infrastructure initiative and welfare reform as two of their top legislative priorities for 2018. Lawmakers also have must-pass budget bills and other unfinished business they need to tackle after the holiday break.  Following is a rundown of the major items on the legislative agenda.  Business groups are eager for Trump and Congress to tackle a major transportation bill that would spur construction of highways, airports, and other infrastructure. Republicans have yet to lay out how they would pay for such an ambitious project when traditional funding mechanisms, such as an increase in the gas tax, remain politically unpopular.      After passing a massive tax-cut package, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other conservative Republicans are eager to overhaul food stamps and other anti-poverty programs. Lawmakers could  add work requirements for able-bodied recipients or lump a range of programs together to give states more control over how they are administered.  That could run into a brick wall in the Senate, where Republicans\u2019 narrow 51-49 majority requires them to work with Democrats on most issues, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said last month that he did not think welfare reform would make much headway.  With congressional elections looming in November, Democrats already are portraying the effort as an attack on the poor, coming on the heels of a tax rewrite that delivered its biggest benefits to businesses and wealthy people.  Outside of Congress, Trump could trim benefits on his own by reducing the time people are eligible for government aid and requiring them to provide more frequent updates on their efforts to find work, said Robert Doar, a welfare specialist at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute.  The federal government has been operating on a series of temporary spending measures since the fiscal year started on Oct. 1 as lawmakers have been unable to pass the detailed spending bills that are supposed to be approved on an annual basis.  Republicans are pushing for a big increase in military spending, while Democrats say that must be matched by a similar hike for domestic programs like environmental protection and public housing. To avoid a partial government shutdown, the two sides must either resolve their differences in a massive spending bill before funding runs out on January 19 or approve another temporary spending measure.  Though Republicans have failed to repeal President Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act, Trump has taken steps to undermine the law\u2019s subsidized insurance exchanges. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine has secured a promise from Republican leaders that the Senate will vote on a bipartisan plan to continue those subsidies, although the effort might be a tougher sell in the House.  President Trump has removed protections for some 800,000 young people who entered the country illegally as children, giving Congress until March 5 to come up with legislation that would prevent the so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d from deportation. Democrats insist that any spending bill must include permanent protections for Dreamers, while Republicans say the issue should be dealt with separately and should be paired with provisions for stronger border security and new restrictions on legal immigration.  The federal government could have trouble paying its bills and face default if Congress does not raise its borrowing authority in the coming months. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the Treasury Department will run out of cash by late March or early April if Congress does not act by then.  Congress also is struggling to agree on funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Funding for the program, which provides coverage to almost 9 million low-income children, has been temporarily extended until March 31.  Reporting by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Bill Trott"

          "body": " (Attention: strong language in eighth paragraph)  By Michelle Martin  BERLIN (Reuters) - A new law meant to curtail hate speech on social media in Germany is stifling free speech and making martyrs out of anti-immigrant politicians whose posts are deleted, the top-selling Bild newspaper said on Thursday.  The law which took effect on Jan. 1 can impose fines of up to 50 million euros ($60 million) on sites that fail to remove hate speech promptly. Twitter has deleted anti-Muslim and anti-migrant posts by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and blocked a satirical account that parodied Islamophobia.  \u201cPlease spare us the thought police!\u201d read a headline in Wednesday\u2019s Bild above an article that called the law a \u201csin\u201d against freedom of opinion enshrined in Germany\u2019s constitution.  The law requires social media sites to delete or block obviously criminal content within 24 hours but Bild Editor-in-Chief Julian Reichelt said it could be applied against anything and anyone since there was no definition of what was \u201cmanifestly unlawful\u201d in most cases.  Intended to prevent radical groups from gaining influence, it was having precisely the opposite effect, he said.  \u201cThe law against online hate speech failed on its very first day. It should be abolished immediately,\u201d Reichelt wrote, adding that the law was turning AfD politicians into \u201copinion martyrs\u201d.  Among the tweets deleted was one by AfD lawmaker Beatrix von Storch criticizing police for tweeting in Arabic, saying they had sought \u201cto appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men\u201d. Police have since asked prosecutors to investigate her for possible incitement to hatred.  A deleted tweet by another AfD member of parliament, Jens Maier, called Noah Becker - the son of former tennis champion Boris Becker - a \u201chalf-nigger\u201d.  Justice Minister Heiko Maas defended the law, telling Bild that freedom of opinion did not mean carte blanche to spread criminal content on the internet.  \u201cCalls to murder, threats, insults and incitement of the masses or Auschwitz lies are not an expression of freedom of  opinion but rather attacks on the freedom of opinion of others,\u201d he said.  Germany has some of the world\u2019s toughest laws on defamation, incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities.  Maas said social networks needed to stick to the law like everyone else, adding: \u201cThose who care about protecting freedom of opinion can\u2019t just look on as criminal incitement and threats inhibit the open exchange of views.\u201d  Reporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"

          "body": "Jan 4 (Reuters) - Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Group Ltd is preparing to appoint a new a chief executive, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the situation.  Karen Katz, who has served as chief executive since 2010, is stepping aside and will be replaced by an outsider, but she will retain her board seat, the people told the financial newspaper.  The company has been hunting for a new leader for some time, some of the people told the Wall Street Journal. Several current CEOs spurned Neiman Marcus' approaches about taking its top spot, the paper reported. (on.wsj.com/2Aor56f)  Neiman Marcus was not immediately available for comment.  The up-market chain has been struggling with a nearly $5 billion debt load mainly due to its leveraged buyout in 2013, when Ares and Canadian public pension fund CPPIB acquired it from other private equity firms.  Seeking ways to cut debt, the retailer in March last year had explored options to change its capital structure or sell itself, but three months later abandoned that plan as its debt pile made any acquisition hard to structure.  At the time, the company had been in talks with Canadian retailer Hudson Bay Co for a full or partial sale, but those talks subsequently fell apart due to Neiman Marcus\u2019 high debt load.

Concerns over the dengue immunisation of nearly 734,000 children aged nine and above resulted in two Philippine congressional inquiries and a criminal investigation.  The country ordered Sanofi to stop the sale, distribution and marketing of Dengvaxia after the company last month warned the vaccine could worsen the disease in some cases.  \u201cThey were fined and their certificate of product registration was suspended,\u201d Health Secretary Francisco Duque told Reuters.

The man, surnamed Chen, said the vessel was bound for Hong Kong, despite knowing it was bound for international waters to traffic oil products, the prosecutors\u2019 office in the southern city of Kaohsiung said on Wednesday.  \u201cThe suspicion of crime is great,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that he faced further investigation, but without giving a reason for the decision to grant bail of T$1.5 million ($50,700).  Reuters was unable to reach Chen for comment.  South Korea seized the Hong Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore in late November. A South Korean foreign ministry official said it transferred as much as 600 tonnes of oil to the North Korea-flagged Sam Jong 2 on Oct. 19 in international waters between China and the Korean peninsula, on the order of its Taiwan-based charterer, Billions Bunker Group Corp.  The Lighthouse Winmore is one of 10 vessels the United States has proposed the United Nations Security Council should blacklist for illicit trade with North Korea, according to documents seen by Reuters last month.  The U.N. Security Council last month unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.

          "title": "Fitch Rates Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena's Planned Tier 2 Notes 'CCC+(EXP)'",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) MILAN/LONDON, January 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A.'s (MPS; B/Stable/b/B) planned subordinated debt issue an expected long-term rating of 'CCC+(EXP)' and a Recovery Rating of 'RR6'. The notes will be issued under MPS's EUR50 billion debt issuance programme and will qualify as Basel III-compliant Tier 2 debt. The final rating is contingent upon final documents conforming to the information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are rated two notches below MPS's 'b' Viability Rating (VR) to reflect our expectations of poor recovery prospects for the notes in case of a non-viability event. We believe that should the bank fail MPS is at risk of being placed into outright resolution and that an intermediary solution prior to resolution (such as a debt restructuring with distressed debt exchange (DDE) or a second precautionary recapitalisation similar to the one received in August 2017) is less likely. Our view is supported by the thin layers of junior non-equity capital currently present at the bank (MPS is just beginning to rebuild its subordinated debt buffers) relative to the risks faced (specifically the still high non-performing loan levels after the disposal of EUR28.6 billion of sofferenze planned for 2018). The prospects of poor recoveries for subordinated bondholders in a resolution scenario are reflected in the 'RR6' Recovery Rating assigned to the notes. We do not notch the notes for non-performance risk as no coupon flexibility is included in their terms. RATING SENSITIVITIES The notes' rating is sensitive to a change in the bank's VR, from which it is notched. The notes' rating is also sensitive to a change in notching should Fitch change its assessment of loss severity (for example the notching could narrow if the quantum of outstanding junior debt buffers in relation to the risks faced reduces) or relative non-performance risk. All else being equal, the notes' rating is also subject to change should Fitch's final Bank Rating Criteria deviate from the Exposure Draft: Bank Rating Criteria (see \"Fitch Publishes Bank Rating Criteria Exposure Draft\" dated 12 December 2017) under which the notes are rated.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch\u2019s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch\u2019s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating.

The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley start-up Aurora announced on Thursday partnerships with Volkswagen AG and Hyundai Motor Co  to develop a self-driving system within their vehicles, the latest tie-up between global automakers and Silicon Valley tech companies.  The non-exclusive partnerships mark the first deals for the young Silicon Valley company and show how some carmakers have chosen to partner with technology companies with more experience in artificial intelligence, deep learning and robotics in order to save time and money bringing self-driving cars to market.  Aurora was founded in 2016 by robotics expert Drew Bagnell, Chris Urmson, who came from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, and Sterling Anderson, who formerly worked at Tesla Inc.  Aurora and Volkswagen said they had been working together over the past six months to integrate Aurora\u2019s sensors, hardware and software into the German carmakers\u2019 electric vehicles to develop self-driving ride services in cities.  Within the self-driving car space, Waymo - formerly Google\u2019s autonomous program headed by Urmson - is offering something similar. The tech company has been working with Fiat Chrysler since 2016 to outfit its Chrysler Pacifica minivans with autonomous technology. Waymo plans to launch a fully autonomous ride-hailing service early next year in Phoenix, Arizona.  In a statement, Volkswagen said the self-driving technology can be integrated over time across the automaker\u2019s brands and in different product categories, whether self-driving pods, shuttles, delivery vans or self-driving trucks.  For Hyundai, Aurora\u2019s technology will be incorporated into custom-developed models and tested in markets including China. Hyundai said the first model to be used in testing will be its latest generation fuel-cell vehicle, debuting at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas next week.  Under the alliance, Hyundai plans to commercialise level 4 autonomous vehicles - which can operate without human input or oversight under select conditions - in unidentified \u201cpilot smart cities\u201d by 2021.  This is the first announcement on a self-driving technology partnership by the South Korean carmaker, which has traditionally shunned tie-ups in favour of developing technology in-house. The strategy has raised investor concerns that it may be left behind in the race for self-driving and electric cars.  A company spokeswoman said Hyundai has \u201cvarious collaborations\u201d under way in self-driving technology and would continue to pursue cooperation.  Urmson said that while each carmaker partnership requires close collaboration to integrate the self-driving system, the technology is \u201cquite transferrable\u201d between vehicle models and manufacturers.

New Jersey\u2019s Assembly on Thursday is slated to vote on a Senate-approved bill to ban inebriated or drugged droning, as well as outlaw flying unmanned aircraft systems over prisons and in pursuit of wildlife.  \u201cIt\u2019s basically like flying a blender,\u201d said John Sullivan, 41, of New York, a drone buff and aerial cinematographer. He said he opposed drunk droning but also fretted about regulatory overreach. \u201cIf I had like one drink, I\u2019d be hesitant to even fly it.\u201d  A 2015 drone crash on the White House lawn fueled debate in the U.S. Congress over the need for drone regulations.  It was a drunken, off-duty employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency who flew the 2-foot-by-2-foot (60 cm by 60 cm) \u201cquadcopter\u201d from a friend\u2019s apartment balcony and lost control of it over the grounds surrounding the White House, the New York Times reported.  New statistics set for release next week show 3.1 million drones were sold in the United States last year, up 28 percent from 2016, said Richard Kowalski, manager for Consumer Technology Association.  \u201cThis was the first year that drone revenues reached $1 billion,\u201d Kowalksi said in an email.  New Jersey is among at least 38 states considering restrictions on the devices this legislative year, including Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina, said Amanda Essex, senior policy specialist for the National Conference of State Legislatures.  \u201cLike any technology, drones have the ability to be used for good, but they also provide new opportunities for bad actors,\u201d said Assemblywoman Annette Quijano of Elizabeth, New Jersey. She backed the bill, which would impose a punishment of up to six months prison and a $1,000 fine for drunk droning.  Already, nine states prohibit drones from operating near or over prisons, including Arizona, Louisiana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin, Essex said.  A drone carrying wire cutters and a cell phone likely aided a prisoner\u2019s escape in July from a maximum security prison in South Carolina, officials said.

          "title": "Fewer family visas approved as Trump toughens vetting of immigrants: Reuters review",
          "body": " NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is ramping up calls on the U.S. Congress to stop legal immigrants from sponsoring extended family members who want to move to the United States, saying so-called \u201cchain migration\u201d poses a threat to national security.  Even without legislative action, however, the number of immigrants approved for family-based visas has dropped this year to the lowest level in more than a decade, a Reuters review of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data shows. The drop has not been previously reported.  The Trump administration has taken a series of measures to more closely scrutinize legal immigration. These steps have been overshadowed by Trump\u2019s more public efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, such as his calls for a wall along the Mexican border and more arrests of people living in the country illegally.  Lately though, Trump has increasingly been taking aim at chain migration, saying it allows a single immigrant \u201cto bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations,\u201d with \u201cno real selection criteria.\u201d He said a Bangladeshi man who set off a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded New York City commuter hub in December was a prime example of the dangers of the system.  Immigration advocates counter that no one automatically qualifies for a visa because a relative is already in the United States. All immigrants undergo security vetting and can face years-long waits before they are given a green light.  The intensified focus on chain migration has been accompanied by an overall slowdown in adjudications of family-based visas, known as I-130s, the Reuters review shows.  The number of approvals dropped by nearly a quarter in the first nine months of 2017 to around 406,000 compared to the same period a year earlier when approvals were more than 530,000, despite a similar number of applications during both periods, USCIS data showed.  The drop was even starker when looking only at I-130s approved for relatives who were not immediate family members. Those fell by 70 percent in the same period, from more than 108,000 in the first nine months of 2016 to 32,500 in the same period in 2017. The entire 2017 fiscal year had the lowest number of approvals for extended family visas since 2000.  USCIS said that since there are a limited number of visas for this category, it prioritizes processing visas that are more immediately available. The agency also said there are normal year-to-year fluctuations in the number of visas that are filed and decided. \u00a0  At the core of the administration\u2019s long-term policy goal is a belief that immigration should be merit-based.  \u201cThose people are just coming in based on connection to a family member,\u201d the new director of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna said in a telephone interview, referring to chain migrants.\u00a0\u201dThat lack of selectivity; it takes us away from where we want to go as a country.\u201d  Cissna said no specific policy guidance has been put in place at USCIS to change the way family-based visas are issued.\u00a0He also said there were no plans to restrict visas for immediate family members and pointed out that approvals of visas and citizenship applications overall are still high.  He has said, however, that his agency is looking closely at all visa categories to root out fraud. USCIS said separately that closer scrutiny could lead to longer processing times.  For example, H-1B temporary work visas for high-skilled workers are facing more hurdles, and applications are receiving far more requests for evidence, slowing down the whole program, according to immigration lawyers and data provided by the government. [nL2N1LY0F5]  USCIS has also put in place new interview requirements for U.S. citizens seeking to bring over their fianc\u00e9s. In the first nine months of 2017, approvals of fianc\u00e9 visas dropped by 35 percent over the same period a year earlier, the Reuters data review found.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Immigration supporters said any efforts by the administration to restrict the entry of family members of migrants was shortsighted.\u00a0They \u201cbring drive and entrepreneurial spirit to the United States,\u201d said Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration law expert at Cornell University.\u00a0  Chain migration has long been a target of groups that favor more restrictions on legal immigration. The idea, supported by organizations like NumbersUSA, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), failed to gain much traction at the highest levels of power in Washington before Trump took office.  \u201cWe have been talking about this for a long time but we were kind of out there in the wilderness\u201d said Ira Mehlman from FAIR. \u201cIt was never at this level of discussion before.\u201d  Now supporters of the ideas of restricting chain migration and tightening standards for legal immigration occupy key positions in the administration. They include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who remains vocal on the issue, and his long-time aide Stephen Miller, who is now one of Trump\u2019s closest policy advisers.  The current USCIS ombudsman Julie Kirchner was previously the executive director of FAIR.  The White House and the Department of Justice did not respond to questions about the influence of the groups, which critics say are anti-immigrant, on administration policy.\u00a0  Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at CIS, said she and her colleagues \u201care in fairly regular contact with various administration officials as they solicit suggestions and ideas to improve policies.\u201d She said she had also spoken to officials in the Obama administration, but only occasionally.  Earlier this month NumbersUSA launched a national advertising campaign against chain migration. A day later the White House posted a presentation on the same subject making many of the same points.  NumbersUSA director Roy Beck said any similarity in the points was just a coincidence. Still, he is thrilled that his group\u2019s ideas on restricting legal immigration have been \u201ccatapulted onto the main stage in an unprecedented way,\u201d he said in an interview.  In April, Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to draft new rules and guidance for the legal immigration system. In August, the White House backed the RAISE Act, proposed legislation sponsored by two Republican lawmakers, that aimed to cut legal immigration by 50 percent over 10 years.

The price fall was the first recorded since FipeZap began calculating its much-followed indicator 10 years ago. While real estate and homebuilding stocks in Brazil performed well in 2017 on the front edge of a consumer-led turnaround, the numbers indicate real estate demand in Latin America\u2019s largest economy still has a way to go to recover.  According to the study, residential real estate prices fell 0.53 percent in nominal terms in 2017. Considering annual inflation of 2.78 percent, prices fell 3.23 percent in real terms, FipeZap said.  Residential markets performed much better in some cities than others. For instance, prices rose in nominal terms by 4.47 percent in the city of Belo Horizonte, but fell 4.45 percent in Rio de Janeiro, which has been hit by low oil prices, corruption scandal, and a state-level debt crisis.  Average residential real estate prices ended 2017 at 7.631 reais ($2.36) in Brazil, FipeZap said, with the highest prices registered in Brazil\u2019s three largest cities, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Brasilia.

The socialist leadership of Britain\u2019s second largest party has promised a range of sweeping economic reforms if it wrestles power from Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives, including a debt-funded 250 billion pound 10-year investment plan.  \u201cWe are in different times, radical times where we need to have a real investment in Britain\u2019s future. Genuinely. I don\u2019t mean that as a slogan, I mean it as an economic strategy,\u201d Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s would-be education minister told the Spectator magazine.  \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk strategy. But all of Britain\u2019s great advancements in the past have been because we\u2019ve had the gumption to take a risk.\u201d  Labour performed much better than expected in a June national election, depriving May of an outright majority in parliament. That has pushed investors to seriously consider the prospect of Labour taking power sooner than the next scheduled election in 2022.  Morgan Stanley cautioned investors on Nov. 26 that political uncertainty in Britain was a bigger threat than Brexit given the risk of Corbyn winning power and then dismantling what was once seen as one of the world\u2019s most stable free-market economies.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn later hit back at the bank, saying: \u201cThey\u2019re right: We\u2019re a threat to a damaging and failed system that is rigged for the few.\u201d  Asked abour Rayner\u2019s remarks, a Labour Party spokeswoman said: \u201cAngela was saying that we have a once in a generation opportunity, with historically low interest rates, to invest in our infrastructure, new technologies and our people, underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule - and that we must take it.\u201d  Labour\u2019s proposed Fiscal Credibility Rule is designed to ensure it only borrows to invest in capital projects which will, over time, pay for themselves.

LVGEM's leverage, as measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, will increase to above 50% at end-2017 and Fitch expects leverage to remain above 45% in 2018-2019. The acquisition is more aggressive than the business plan the company previously shared with Fitch, and has crowded out the company's financial resources for its property development business. LVGEM's 2017 contracted sales were also affected by Shenzhen's stringent pricing policy in 2017 and Fitch expects LVGEM's project concentration in Shenzhen to continue to expose the company to regulatory uncertainties. KEY RATING DRIVERS Acquisition Raises Leverage: Fitch expects LVGEM's leverage to increase to above 50% at end-2017 and remain above 45% in the next few years, following the completion of its HKD9 billion acquisition of an office building in Hong Kong. The company aims to complete the construction of the office tower, which is located in Kwun Tong district in Kowloon, by mid-2019 and generate revenue by 4Q19. Fitch thinks that it is still too early to assess the possibility of LVGEM executing its option to sell parts of the office building to deleverage, but the option remains and will provide leverage headroom for the company. Sales Below Expectation: LVGEM's contracted sales in January-November 2017 were substantially lower than our expectation of CNY5 billion for the full year. The slower sales were mainly due to a delay in pre-sales in Mangrove Bay No. 1 Phase I, which we previously expected to generate more than CNY1.4 billion sales in 2017. The delay was caused by Shenzhen's restrictive pricing policies that capped the project's average selling price at an unfavourable level. LVGEM is targeting to launch pre-sales no later than 1Q18. Fitch thinks that LVGEM's unique strength in Shenzhen has turned into a double-edged sword as the company has been caught by the stringent home purchase restriction policy in Shenzhen while its higher leverage following its substantial investment has reduced its ability to respond to the restrictions. LVGEM's strategy of slowing sales to achieve the best margin has now resulted in leverage being sustained at higher levels. Quality Investment Properties: LVGEM's investment property portfolio includes the Shenzhen NEO complex, which has office and retail components, and three Zoll community retail centres in Shenzhen, one of which opened in 2017. The Shenzhen NEO complex is located in the city's CBD and is almost fully occupied. Rents that were renewed in 2016 were re-contracted at 15% more on average in 2017 compared with their previous rental rates. The two older Zoll centres had approximately 90% occupancy rates and positive rental reversion of more than 10% in 2016. The contribution from the planned Hong Kong office building will depend on the proportion of the building that is retained for rental. Healthy Recurring Income, Lower Coverage: LVGEM continued to generate strong recurring income in 2017. Fitch expects LVGEM to generate recurring cash inflow of CNY700 million in 2017 from rentals from the Shenzhen NEO towers, hotel and carpark rentals, and its property management business. Fitch expects recurring EBITDA/interest coverage to drop to around 0.4x in 2017 due to the Hong Kong office acquisition, compared with 0.6x in 2014-2016 and our previous expectation of 0.5x in 2017. Fitch expects coverage to trend towards 0.3x by end-2019. DERIVATION SUMMARY LVGEM's rating is supported by its portfolio of quality investment properties, including its centrally located Shenzhen NEO office buildings. Fitch assesses LVGEM's investment properties alone as having a business profile of around 'BB', with more than USD50 million in rental EBITDA per year and more than USD1.5 billion in rental-deriving assets; setting it apart from most Chinese homebuilders that rely on more risky development-property sales to service their debts. This is comparable with Lai Fung Holdings Limited's (BB-/Stable) USD60 million in recurring EBITDA and USD2.0 billion in investment property value. Meanwhile, LVGEM's main business focus is still its urban redevelopment projects in Shenzhen. Its contracted sales are smaller and more volatile than most peers due to the uncertainty about when such projects would be injected from its ultimate shareholder. Fitch also expects LVGEM's leverage to increase to above 45% after 2017, following the acquisition of the Hong Kong office building. This level is similar to that of other 'B' rated peers, such as Yida China Holdings Limited's (B/Positive) 46% and Hong Yang Group Company Limited's (B/Stable) 53%. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - LVGEM successfully raises funds through issuance of new shares in 2018. - An injection of a large Shenzhen urban redevelopment project before the end of 2019, with LVGEM financing the consideration due to the controlling shareholder via equity issuance and shareholder loans. - LVGEM's contracted sales to reach CNY3 billion in 2017 and CNY10 billion in 2018. - Recurring EBITDA to increase to above CNY400 million in 2017-2018, from CNY380 million in 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Attributable contracted sales sustained above CNY10 billion while net debt/adjusted inventory sustained below 45%; and - Recurring EBITDA/cash interest sustained above 0.3x Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Net debt/adjusted inventory sustained above 55% - Failing to maintain a project pipeline (including controlling shareholder's land bank) sufficient for two years of development LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity for Acquisition: LVGEM will need to pay around HKD5.5 billion, or CNY4.6 billion, in 2017 out of the total consideration of HKD9 billion. The company's 1H17 available cash of CNY3 billion and its US dollar bond issuance will provide sufficient liquidity to make this payment. LVGEM has also secured offshore loan financing using this new Hong Kong office property as collateral. This, together with the company's other financing plans, will allow LVGEM to replenish liquidity sufficiently to meet the operational needs of its development-property business.

On a year-on-year basis prices fell by 2.1 percent in December, Real Estate Norway said, marking the first time since 2013 that full-year prices were weaker then the previous year.  Tighter mortgage regulations, lower population growth and a boom in construction have all contributed to weaker demand for housing in recent months.  From an April 2017 all-time-high, prices are down some 6.7 percent nationwide, and by a sharper 11.5 percent in Oslo.  \u201cThe (December) drop is in line with the trend and there is no sign of the downturn intensifying,\u201d Nordea Markets wrote in a note to clients, adding that the December fall was probably slightly smaller than the central bank\u2019s forecast for the month.  \u201cWe stick to our view that prices have somewhat more to fall before prices stabilize in the spring ...

The pound also benefited from broad-based dollar weakness and a general rebound in risk sentiment which has lifted sentiment towards the British currency, but persistent structural factors, such as a widening current account deficit, kept investors wary.  \u201cLooking at positioning data, inflation and a big current account deficit, sterling looks to be more of a sell than a buy at these levels,\u201d said Hans Redeker, global head of currency strategy at Morgan Stanley based in London.  Sterling rose a quarter of a percent higher at $1.3545 and remained within striking distance of a four month high of $1.3659 hit in late September.  Long bets on sterling are hovering near their biggest levels in more than three years, according to the latest positioning data, as investors have gradually raised their sterling bets in recent weeks.  Britain\u2019s dominant services sector grew unexpectedly quickly last month and businesses are more upbeat about 2018 than they were for much of 2017, but Brexit is weighing on investment plans, a survey showed on Thursday.  A near 3 percent rally in sterling since a landmark EU summit last month that moved Brexit talks to the next stage has made some investors more optimistic on the currency\u2019s outlook in the coming weeks.  \u201cSterling held up well, and we have a window of \u2018Brexitless\u2019 trading until March and the resumption of talks while it also seems that support for a second referendum is starting to grow, especially in the parliamentary parties,\u201d said John Marley, head of FX strategy at Infinity International, a currency risk management firm.  The pound last year recorded its best annual performance against the dollar since 2009, with an almost 10 percent rise amid broad dollar weakness. But it is still around 10 percent down against the dollar since the vote for Brexit.  Against the euro, it is still more than 15 percent below its Brexit referendum day low.

          "body": "* Aldi UK December sales up over 15 pct  * Plans 70 more stores in 2018  * Targeting 1,000 UK stores by 2022 (Adds detail, CEO, analyst comment)  By James Davey  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Aldi UK, the British arm of the German discount supermarket, said it would press ahead with its aggressive expansion in 2018 after a record Christmas sales performance, boosted by demand for its premium ranges.  The rise of privately-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl has transformed UK food retailing over the last decade, driving down the returns of Britain\u2019s big four players \u2014 market leader Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons.  While the established big four have fought back by cutting prices and improving service they are still losing market share to Aldi and Lidl, which are opening new stores at a rapid pace.  Aldi added 76 stores in 2017, bringing the total to 762 and is targeting 1,000 stores across the UK by 2022. A further 70 store openings are planned for this year.  \u201cWe see significant capacity for further growth as there are still more than 400 towns and cities across the UK without an Aldi store,\u201d Aldi UK & Ireland CEO Matthew Barnes said on Thursday.  \u201cShoppers in these areas consistently tell us they would shop at Aldi if they could, and we are committed to meeting this demand for new Aldi stores,\u201d he added.  Aldi\u2019s expansion plans have not been slowed by three straight years of falling profit. It says its German parent, Aldi Sud, is investing in the UK for the long term.  Industry data published last month put Aldi\u2019s UK grocery market share at 6.9 percent, up 0.7 percentage points on the year. Last year it overtook the Co-operative Group to become Britain\u2019s fifth largest grocer.  With its expansion plans it now has Morrisons, which currently has a market share of 10.6 percent, in its sights.  Aldi said its sales rose over 15 percent in December year-on-year, taking the annual figure for the UK and Ireland over 10 billion pounds ($13.5 billion) for the first time. Sales in 2016 were 8.74 billion pounds.  Aldi did not provide a like-for-like sales number.  Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said the 15 percent number was largely driven by additional space and inflation. He estimated volume like-for-like growth of 2.5 percent, which he said implied a slowdown from last year.  Aldi UK said it saw a surge in demand for its premium \u201cSpecially Selected\u201d products, with sales increasing by over 30 percent during December.  It said top-selling premium products included Aberdeen Angus beef roasting joints and Irish cream liqueur.  \u201cAlthough we saw strong growth across all categories, the performance of our premium Specially Selected range in particular surpassed all expectations,\u201d said Barnes.  Aldi UK also said on Thursday it would pay its store assistants a minimum of 8.85 pounds an hour from Feb. 1 - matching the rate recommended by campaigning group Living Wage Foundation.  Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons are all scheduled to update on Christmas trading next week. ($1 = 0.7388 pounds) (Editing by Keith Weir)"

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, January 04 (Fitch) Nigerian banks may find it more difficult to sustain profitability given the decline in net treasury bill (T-bill) issuance in Nigeria's 1Q18 issuance programme, Fitch Ratings says. The slowdown in T-bill issuance marks a change of strategy as the government looks to increase its financing from external sources and longer-dated domestic issuances. Record T-bill issuance in 2017 helped support the Central Bank of Nigeria's strategy to maintain naira exchange-rate stability. High yields on T-bills issued in 2017 (around 13%-14% on 90-day T-bills) attracted investors and helped to support the naira. An increase in oil export earnings and the introduction in April 2017 of the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing (NAFEX) mechanism, commonly referred to as the \"Investors and Exporters' FX Window\", also helped naira stabilisation during the second half of 2017. Nigerian banks are highly reliant on net interest income for profitability and T-bills proved to be an important source of profits in 2017. Interest on securities represented 30% of total gross interest earned in 9M17, averaged across Nigerian banks rated by Fitch (2016: 23%). By end-September 2017, government securities including T-bills represented more than 15% of the banks' assets as new lending fell, reflecting weak credit demand, tighter underwriting standards and banks' reluctance to extend new loans as they focused on extensive restructuring of troubled oil-related and other portfolios. Even the country's largest banks cut back on new lending, with Guaranty Trust Bank's stock of outstanding loans falling 10% during 9M17, FBN Holdings' by 4.6%, Zenith's by 3.7% and Access's by 1.1%. United Bank for Africa's loan book grew 5.6%, but this is likely to have been driven by non-Nigerian lending as the bank operates in 22 other African countries. We expect falling T-bill yields and lower issuance to put pressure on Nigerian banks' profitability in 2018. The CBN's latest issuance schedule shows NGN1.1 trillion (USD3.6 billion) of rollovers in 1Q18 against NGN1.3 trillion of maturing bills. In 2017, rollovers fully covered maturing bills. Performance metrics at all banks will be affected by weak demand for lending, falling T-bill yields, lower foreign-currency translation gains and rising loan impairment charges, but the largest banks are best placed to withstand these challenges. Operating returns are still strong at GTB (9M17 operating return on average equity (ROAE): 37%), Zenith (28%), UBA (22%) and Access (20%), while FBNH's operating ROAE is lower (12%) but improving. However, some second-tier banks with a 9M17 operating ROAE of 4%-6% may struggle to remain profitable in 2018. We highlighted falling profitability for Nigerian banks in our 2018 Outlook report for sub-Saharan banks, available by clicking on the link below. Our 2018 rating outlook for the Nigerian banking sector is negative, reflecting continued fragility in the operating environment and the Negative Outlook on the sovereign's 'B+' rating.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian investigators and police hoisted the wreckage of a seaplane from the Sydney river where it sank after crashing on New Year\u2019s Eve, killing six people, including the chief executive of British catering company Compass Group Plc.  Richard Cousins, 58, his two sons, his fiance and her daughter and the pilot were killed when the plane hit the water shortly after takeoff on Sunday.   The family were on a short tourist flight, operated by Sydney Seaplanes, from a waterfront restaurant on the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney, to Rose Bay in the city\u2019s east.   A preliminary report into the crash was expected in about 30 days, with a final report taking up to 12 months, according to Australian Transport Safety Bureau executive director Nat Nagy.  \u201cWe are reasonably confident that we will be able to do a thorough examination of the key components of the aircraft, to understand whether they were operating correctly at the time,\u201d Nagy told reporters.  Police divers wrapped slings around the fuselage and a barge fitted with a small crane slowly lifted the wreck, upside down and without wings, from about 13 meters of water near Cowan, 40 km (25 miles) north of Sydney.      The propeller, cockpit and front section of fuselage were crumpled, and the landing floats were raised separately. The pieces were loaded on to the barge deck and covered with a tarpaulin, television pictures showed.  Air crash investigation records, first reported by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Thursday and reviewed by Reuters, show a plane with the same serial number crashed 21 years earlier, when it was being used as a crop duster.  The 1996 accident report found that the aircraft, a DHC-2 de Havilland Canada, likely stalled and that conditions were gusty when it crashed, killing the pilot.  \u201cIt was repaired after the accident and all appropriate approvals and checks were done. It was then re-registered and went back into service,\u201d a spokesman for Australia\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority said in an email.  A spokesman for Sydney Seaplanes said the company had no comment while the investigation into the crash continues.  Additional reporting by James Regan; Editing by Nick Macfie"

          "body": "DAR ES SALAAM, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Tanzania\u2019s central bank on Thursday revoked the licenses of five \u201ccritically undercapitalised\u201d community banks to protect financial stability in East Africa\u2019s No. 3 economy.  There are about 40 commercial banks and a dozen community banks, which target savings from specific communities or sectors such as farming, but the financial sector is largely dominated by just a handful of big banks.  The central bank said it would liquidate the Covenant Bank for Women (Tanzania) Ltd, Efatha Bank Ltd, Njombe Community Bank Ltd, Kagera Farmers\u2019 Cooperative Bank Ltd and Meru Community Bank Ltd.  \u201cThe aforesaid banks are critically undercapitalised,\u201d the central bank said in a statement.  It said continuation of operations of the banks in their current capital position was \u201cdetrimental to the interests of depositors and poses a risk to the stability of the financial system.\u201d  None of the institutions were immediately available for comment.  The closure of the banks comes after President John Magufuli ordered the central bank to take action against failing financial institutions.  This brings to eight the number of banks whose business licences have been cancelled since 2017.  Analysts said a steep increase in bad loans coupled with a sharp decline in credit to the private sector are threatening to undermine economic growth.  The central bank announced new rules last June for capital buffers, a move that will force banks to hold more capital to withstand financial shocks following a sharp rise in non-performing loans.  Tanzania\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 6.8 percent in the first half of 2017 from 7.7 percent in the same period in 2016.  The International Monetary Fund said last month Tanzania\u2019s banking sector was well-capitalised, but some small and mid-sized banks faced a sizable reduction in capitalisation ratios.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Robey Warshaw, the small boutique advisory firm that has worked on some of Britain\u2019s biggest deals, saw its annual profits soar 73 percent to more than 60 million pounds ($81 mln), according to a company filing.  The firm, founded by veteran investment bankers Sir Simon Robey, Simon Warshaw and Philip Apostolides in 2013, has quickly established itself as one of the UK\u2019s leading M&A advisory businesses with roles in blockbuster deals, including Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s $53 billion acquisition of BG Group, announced in 2015, and Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s $16.6 billion purchase of U.S. baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition last year.  In the year ended March 2017, it made a profit of 63.3 million pounds, up from 36.6 million pounds in the same period a year earlier, the accounts show.  The trio of founders will share the profit, with the highest paid individual, who was not identified in the filing, entitled to receive 37.3 million pounds.  It came as turnover at Robey Warshaw leapt to 72.7 million pounds from 43.3 million pounds as the firm, which is based in London\u2019s upmarket Mayfair district, netted fees from deals that closed in the period.  These included advising brewer SABMiller on its $110 billion acquisition by rival Anheuser-Busch InBev, a deal that completed in October 2016, and SoftBank on its $32 billion takeover of British chip designer Arm Holdings, which closed in September 2016.  Major deals have enabled the firm to quickly grow its profits from the 19.4 million pounds its three founders shared in the 18 months to March 2015.  Aside from the trio of partners, the accounts show the small firm averaged 13 employees during its 2017 financial year. ($1 = 0.7382 pounds) (Reporting by Ben Martin; Editing by Susan Fenton)"

          "title": "Tony Blair tells UK voters: time is running out to stop Brexit folly",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Former British prime minister Tony Blair told voters on Thursday that time was running out to reverse Brexit, a folly that he said would torpedo Britain\u2019s remaining clout and be regretted for generations to come.  More than a year and a half since the 2016 Brexit vote, the United Kingdom remains deeply divided over the planned EU exit that Prime Minister Theresa May says will take place on March 29, 2019.  Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the divorce is Britain\u2019s most significant geopolitical move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the $2.5 trillion UK economy and the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc.  Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said Britain would be poorer and weaker, and he warned that May had solved none of the problems over Northern Ireland\u2019s post-Brexit status.  \u201cWe are making an error the contemporary world cannot understand and the generations of the future will not forgive,\u201d Blair said in an article published on his website on Thursday.  \u201c2018 will be the last chance to secure a say on whether the new relationship proposed with Europe is better than the existing one,\u201d Blair, 64, said.  Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: just over 15 years ago, British leaders such as Blair were arguing about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the reserve of skeptics on the fringes of both major parties.  But the turmoil of the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration and a series of miscalculations by former prime minister David Cameron prompted the United Kingdom to vote 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in a June 2016 referendum.  Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing other critics such as French President Emmanuel Macron and billionaire investor George Soros, who have suggested that Britain could still change its mind.  So far, opinion polls show little sign of a change of heart among voters on Brexit and it is unclear how it could be stopped if both major political parties support the divorce.  Supporters of Brexit accused Blair of undermining both  Britain\u2019s negotiations with the EU and the will of the people.   \u201cBlair and his elitist gang are damaging our negotiating strength, thus damaging our national interest by their continuing efforts to undermine democracy,\u201d said Richard Tice, who helped found one of the two Leave campaign groups.  \u201cHistory will not forgive them,\u201d Tice told Reuters.  Blair is unpopular in Britain for his decision to back then-U.S. President George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq and the justification he used for going into a war that cost the deaths of 150,000 Iraqi civilians and 179 British soldiers.  Blair implored his Labour Party, which is now led by veteran leftist Jeremy Corbyn, to join the fight to stop Brexit.  \u201cMake Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100 percent,\u201d Blair said. \u201cIf Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the Single Market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour.\u201d  Corbyn, who voted against membership of the EU in a 1975 referendum, said he voted in 2016 to remain in the bloc, though opponents said he did not campaign strongly in the referendum.  Eight out of 10 grassroots Labour Party members want a referendum on the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, according to a survey published on Thursday.  The survey of attitudes within Britain\u2019s main political parties showed 49 percent of Labour members definitely wanted a second referendum on the exit deal and a further 29 percent said they were more in favour of the idea than against it.  The poll of more than 4,000 members of political parties was conducted shortly after last June\u2019s national election as part of a three-year academic project by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London.

The socialist leadership of Britain\u2019s second largest party has promised a range of sweeping economic reforms if it wrestles power from Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives, including a debt-funded 250 billion pound 10-year investment plan.  \u201cWe are in different times, radical times where we need to have a real investment in Britain\u2019s future. Genuinely. I don\u2019t mean that as a slogan, I mean it as an economic strategy,\u201d Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s would-be education minister told the Spectator magazine.  \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk strategy. But all of Britain\u2019s great advancements in the past have been because we\u2019ve had the gumption to take a risk.\u201d  Labour performed much better than expected in a June national election, depriving May of an outright majority in parliament. That has pushed investors to seriously consider the prospect of Labour taking power sooner than the next scheduled election in 2022.  Morgan Stanley cautioned investors on Nov. 26 that political uncertainty in Britain was a bigger threat than Brexit given the risk of Corbyn winning power and then dismantling what was once seen as one of the world\u2019s most stable free-market economies.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn later hit back at the bank, saying: \u201cThey\u2019re right: We\u2019re a threat to a damaging and failed system that is rigged for the few.\u201d (Reporting by William James; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)"

          "body": "* World stocks hit record on upbeat growth data  * Volatility gauge near record low as risk seen limited  * Oil hits highest since mid 2015  * Fed minutes show uncertainty over tax cut plan impact  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Marc Jones  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Market bulls resumed their charge on Thursday as strong data from the world\u2019s biggest economies sent stock index records tumbling and oil prices to their highest since mid-2015.  In an apparent acceleration of last year\u2019s global equity boom, MSCI\u2019s world stocks index and London\u2019s FTSE both set records as Europe opened.  Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei - Asia\u2019s biggest market - earlier shot to its highest since 1991 with a 3.3 percent surge. Asia-Pacific excluding Japan also scaled a decade-high peak as a fifth day of gains in China helped emerging market stocks to a 6-1/2 year high as well.  \u201cIt is a continuation of the goldilocks story,\u201d said State Street Global Markets\u2019 head of macro strategy Michael Metcalfe.  \u201cThe main theme last year was strong growth and accommodative (monetary) policy and the data we have had so far suggest that the growth is expected to accelerate, and without inflation.\u201d  The data published on Thursday reinforced expectations that solid world growth will boost demand for goods, including oil, and lift corporate earnings.  China\u2019s services sector activity hit its highest level in more than three years, manufacturing data from Japan came in strong and euro zone surveys showed the bloc enjoying its strongest run in nearly seven years.  IHS Markit\u2019s Final Composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index - seen as a good overall growth indicator for the 19-country region - rose to 58.1 in December from 57.5 in November and up slightly from a flash estimate of 58.0.  \u201cA stellar end to 2017 for the euro zone rounded off the best year for over a decade, continuing to confound widely held fears that rising political uncertainty would curb economic growth,\u201d Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.  Another factor behind the upbeat mood was that minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s mid-December meeting released on Wednesday did little to change that view that it will stick to measured increases in U.S. interest rates.  They showed policymakers expect U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cut plans to boost consumer spending but are still uncertain about the impact the stimulus would have on inflation.  Fed funds rate futures moved to price a 75 percent chance of a rate hike by March, compared with around 60 percent at the end of last year. But markets are still not fully pricing in the three rate increases many Fed officials expect this year.  The dollar climbed off a three-month low after the minutes but was backsliding again in Europe on Thursday as the euro zone and Asia data handed the initiative back to the euro and yen.  It left the greenback flat at 112.61 yen and the euro up 0.15 percent at $1.2033. If the single currency gets above September\u2019s peak of $1.2092 it would return to ground last trod in early 2015.  \u201cWe see some very positive euro sentiment in the market right now,\u201d said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt.  Euro zone bond yields were also creeping higher, buoyed by the data, as investors readied for new debt sales from France and Spain in what is traditionally one of the busiest issuance months of the year.  Yields on French and Spanish 10-year bonds were around 1 basis point higher. In Germany, the bloc\u2019s benchmark bond issuer, 10-year bond yields were up 1.5 bps at 0.46 percent and holding within reach of recent two-month highs.  The bigger focus though was on the ongoing rise in commodity prices, which often have a big influence on global inflation.  Oil prices were touching levels not seen since before commodity markets slumped in 2014/15, having been boosted by tensions in key producer Iran and ongoing OPEC-led output cuts.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose to as high as $62.17 per barrel, up 0.9 percent for the day and their highest level since mid-2015. International benchmark Brent also scaled a 2-1/2-year high of $68.19 a barrel.  At the same time, inflation expectations indicated by the gap between 10-year U.S. inflation-linked bonds and conventional ones, was above 2 percent at the highest level since March.  \u201cOil appears to be traded at a premium compared to economic fundamentals because of concerns over development in Iran,\u201d said Motofumi Okoshi, senior economist at Nomura Securities.  At the moment though, forward contracts are trading cheaper than expected spot prices, a condition known as \u2018backwardation\u2019, suggesting investors expect any supply shortages to be temporary.  \u201cIf conditions in Iran deteriorate further, I expect forward contracts will begin to be bought as well,\u201d Okoshi added.  Political concerns were also supporting safe-haven gold, which fetched $1,310 per ounce, after hitting a 3-1/2-month high of $1,321.5 on Wednesday.  Still, investors expect financial markets to stay stable overall. The Cboe Volatility index, which measures implied price volatility of U.S. stocks in the next one month, closed at 9.15 on Wednesday, just short of its record closing low of 9.14 touched on Nov. 3.

          "title": "Exclusive: Trump administration to announce cuts in 'security assistance' for Pakistan",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been informing members of Congress that it will announce as soon as Wednesday plans to cut off \u201csecurity assistance\u201d to Pakistan, congressional aides said on Wednesday, a day after the White House warned Islamabad it would have to do more to maintain U.S. aid.  Aides in two congressional offices said the State Department called on Wednesday to inform them that it would announce on Wednesday or Thursday that aid was being cut off, although it was not clear how much, what type or for how long.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders declined to say whether an announcement was imminent. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The calls to Capitol Hill came a day after Washington accused Pakistan of playing a \u201cdouble game\u201d on fighting terrorism and warned Islamabad it would have to do more if it wanted to maintain U.S. aid.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Tuesday that Washington would withhold $255 million in assistance to Pakistan. Her statement followed an angry tweet from Trump on Monday that the United States had been rewarded with \u201cnothing but lies and deceit\u201d for giving Pakistan billions in aid.  Pakistan civilian and military chiefs rejected what they termed \u201cincomprehensible\u201d U.S. comments and summoned U.S. Ambassador David Hale to explain Trump\u2019s tweet.  Relations between Islamabad and Washington have been strained for years over Islamabad\u2019s alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban.  The United States also alleges that senior Afghan Taliban commanders live on Pakistani soil and has signaled it will cut aid and take other steps if Islamabad does not stop helping or turning a blind eye to Haqqani militants crossing the border to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.  Many members of the U.S. Congress, particularly Republicans,  who control both houses of the legislature, have been critical of the Pakistani government and called for cuts in military and other aid.

          "body": "ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Thursday sentenced a lawmaker from the pro-Kurdish opposition party to 16 years and 8 months in prison, broadcaster CNN Turk and other media said, nearly one year after his arrest over terror charges.  Idris Baluken, a lawmaker for the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP), was first jailed pending trial in a terrorism-related investigation in November 2016. He was later released in January 2017 and arrested again one month later.  Baluken and other detained HDP members, including the party\u2019s co-leaders, are mostly accused of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, which has conducted a decades-old insurgency against the Turkish state. All of the accused have denied the charges.  About 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended and roughly 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial since a 2016 failed coup. The HDP says as many as 5,000 of its members have been detained.  Rights groups and some Western allies say President Tayyip Erdogan has used the putsch as an excuse to quash dissent, but the government argues the purges are necessary to thwart the threats it is facing.

          "body": "(ADVISORY- Follow European and UK stock markets in real time on the Reuters Live Markets blog on Eikon, see cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=livemarkets)  * FTSE 100 up 0.2 pct  * Oil majors, miners rise  * Debenhams drop weighs on retailers  By Kit Rees  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - A rally in oil majors pushed the UK\u2019s top share index to an all-time high on Thursday, though elsewhere retailers were under pressure after a profit warning from Debenhams.  Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent at 7,686.95 points by 0948 GMT, while mid caps rose 0.1 percent.  \u201cJust because we\u2019re trading on ground that\u2019s never been traded on before doesn\u2019t really mean that we\u2019re due a pullback - we do expect (the FTSE 100) to push higher,\u201d John Moore, trader at Berkeley Capital, said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen that the historic correlation between the pound and the FTSE is somewhat not as strong as before,\u201d Moore added, saying bigger factors, such as the oil price, were driving the index.  A rally in cyclical sectors such as financials and energy added around 20 points to the index, with BP and Shell rising 1 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.  The UK\u2019s oil and gas index was up 0.8 percent at its highest level since May 2008.  The British oil majors aped a move higher in oil prices, which were spurred to their highest level since mid-2015 on the back of tensions in producer Iran.  A supportive research note from Barclays also helped the energy sector, in which analysts said they expected European integrated oil and refining companies to be cash flow positive after dividends in the fourth quarter, thanks to a higher oil price.  Likewise positive metals prices also drove shares in British miners. Shares in Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Billiton rose between 0.6 percent to 0.9 percent.  The mood was less positive among retail stocks, however, after shares in small cap Debenhams dropped more than 16 percent after a profit warning following a difficult Christmas trading period.  This contrasted with Next\u2019s upbeat update on Christmas sales on Wednesday.  Shares in Debenhams were on track for their biggest one-day loss since March 2008, while blue chip Marks & Spencer were also down 2.7 percent at the bottom of the FTSE.  \u201cOngoing structural challenges, a soft consumer environment, rising costs and increasing capex demands make for a difficult outlook (for Debenhams),\u201d analysts at Liberum said in a note.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices in northern China have dropped more than 40 percent from record highs reached less than two weeks ago as a supply crunch has eased and curbs have been enacted on industrial users of the fuel.  Ex-plant LNG prices were quoted at 5,700 yuan ($877) per ton in the Inner Mongolia region, compared to 9,750 yuan on Dec. 24, industry publication www.yeslng.com reported on Thursday. Prices in Shaanxi province fell 46 percent during the same period to 5,520 yuan.   \u201cSome industrial users were cut off gas supply or couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Li Ruipeng, a manager at trucked-LNG dealer Tangshan Huapu Gas Co based in the city of Tangshan in the northern Chinese province of Hebei.  \u201cSupplies have increased as more gas has been diverted from the south to north,\u201d said Li.  Chinese demand for natural gas has surged this winter after the government required residential and industrial users to switch to the fuel for heating to reduce the emissions produced by coal heating. Under the plan, industrial users could have their gas shut off in the event of supply shortages.   Last month\u2019s record high prices forced some industrial and even some residential users to switch away from natural gas to liquefied petroleum gas or coal, said Diao Zhouwei, an analyst at IHS Markit.  Some steel mills in Tangshan, China\u2019s biggest steel producing city, were forced to stop operations as the fuel became too costly, said another LNG trucking dealer, who asked to remain unidentified.   \u201cSome may only resume after the heating season is over,\u201d said the dealer.  On Dec. 18, amid the surge in gas prices, China\u2019s economic planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) ordered state-owned energy companies to cut gas supply to industry by about 15 million cubic meters per day.  However, the industrial curtailments have not caused imported LNG prices to drop as much the ex-plant prices of domestically produced fuel.  Ex-terminal quotes for PetroChina\u2019s Caofeidian receiving terminal were down 22 percent over the past ten days to 5,130 yuan per ton, yeslng.com reported.   Ex-terminal prices at Sinopec Corp\u2019s Qingdao terminal were little changed during the period and were at 7,400 yuan per ton on Thursday, the website reported.  Supply to northern China has been bolstered by diversions of gas from the south. Last month, the NDRC said 14 million cubic meters a day of gas was being moved from the south to the north.

          "title": "Tony Blair tells UK voters: time is running out to stop Brexit folly",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Former British prime minister Tony Blair told voters on Thursday that time was running out to reverse Brexit, a folly that he said would torpedo Britain\u2019s remaining clout and be regretted for generations to come.  More than a year and a half since the 2016 Brexit vote, the United Kingdom remains deeply divided over the planned EU exit that Prime Minister Theresa May says will take place on March 29, 2019.  Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the divorce is Britain\u2019s most significant geopolitical move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the $2.5 trillion UK economy and the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc.  Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said Britain would be poorer and weaker, and he warned that May had solved none of the problems over Northern Ireland\u2019s post-Brexit status.  \u201cWe are making an error the contemporary world cannot understand and the generations of the future will not forgive,\u201d Blair said in an article published on his website on Thursday.  \u201c2018 will be the last chance to secure a say on whether the new relationship proposed with Europe is better than the existing one,\u201d Blair, 64, said.  Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: just over 15 years ago, British leaders such as Blair were arguing about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the reserve of skeptics on the fringes of both major parties.  But the turmoil of the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration and a series of miscalculations by former prime minister David Cameron prompted the United Kingdom to vote 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in a June 2016 referendum.  Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing other critics such as French President Emmanuel Macron and billionaire investor George Soros, who have suggested that Britain could still change its mind.  So far, opinion polls show little sign of a change of heart among voters on Brexit and it is unclear how it could be stopped if both major political parties support the divorce.  Supporters of Brexit accused Blair of undermining both  Britain\u2019s negotiations with the EU and the will of the people.   \u201cBlair and his elitist gang are damaging our negotiating strength, thus damaging our national interest by their continuing efforts to undermine democracy,\u201d said Richard Tice, who helped found one of the two Leave campaign groups.  \u201cHistory will not forgive them,\u201d Tice told Reuters.  Blair is unpopular in Britain for his decision to back then-U.S. President George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq and the justification he used for going into a war that cost the deaths of 150,000 Iraqi civilians and 179 British soldiers.  Blair implored his Labour Party, which is now led by veteran leftist Jeremy Corbyn, to join the fight to stop Brexit.  \u201cMake Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100 percent,\u201d Blair said. \u201cIf Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the Single Market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour.\u201d  Corbyn, who voted against membership of the EU in a 1975 referendum, said he voted in 2016 to remain in the bloc, though opponents said he did not campaign strongly in the referendum.  Eight out of 10 grassroots Labour Party members want a referendum on the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, according to a survey published on Thursday.  The survey of attitudes within Britain\u2019s main political parties showed 49 percent of Labour members definitely wanted a second referendum on the exit deal and a further 29 percent said they were more in favour of the idea than against it.  The poll of more than 4,000 members of political parties was conducted shortly after last June\u2019s national election as part of a three-year academic project by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London.

          "title": "Quest for new oil discoveries still on back burner",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Despite the strongest start for oil prices in four years, the world\u2019s top oil companies are hesitating to accelerate the search for new resources as a determination to retain capital discipline trumps the hope of making bonanza discoveries.  Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and their peers are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie (WoodMac), despite a growing urgency to replenish reserves after years of reining back investment.  (For graphic 'Global spending on oil and gas exploration' click reut.rs/2CjAONv)  Global investment in exploration, vital to increase output and offset the natural decline of existing fields, will reach $37 billion in 2018, down 7 percent from a year earlier and over 60 percent below the 2014 peak, according to WoodMac.  For majors, spending will collectively drop by around 4 percent this year to represent about a tenth of investment in oil and gas production, known as upstream.  \u201cThis could be the new normal, with the days of one dollar in six or seven going to exploration forever in the past,\u201d WoodMac said in a report.   The declines, however, mask a modest uptick in drilling activity as lower rig rates and a focused approach on well-charted basins allow firms to do more with their money, according to WoodMac analyst Andrew Latham.  \u201cInvestment will be down year-on year but activity will be flat to slightly higher,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  The collapse in oil prices in 2014 led to a deep retrenchment in spending for the sector, but companies still need to increase their resources as reserves dwindle.  As crude prices and profits recover - prices are currently above $65 a barrel, the highest since mid-2015 - the push to beef up reserves will only increase.   The exploration success rate has dropped from 40 percent to 35 percent over the past decade, highlighting the importance of acquisitions as an alternative, albeit generally more expensive, to build resources.  \u201cExploration spending (is) to remain low ... implying the need for more merger and acquisition\u201d activity, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said.  After spending more than $30 billion on acquisitions in 2017, oil Majors are expected to continue to make bolt-on purchases in areas where they already operate, even though the \u201cupstream M&A window is starting to close,\u201d RBC said, alluding to higher asset valuations and fewer distressed sellers.   The majors will once again be the ones to watch thanks to stronger balance sheets compared with smaller rivals, WoodMac\u2019s Latham said.   Exploration is expected to focus on deepwater basins such as Mexico, Brazil and Guyana where large discoveries have been made in recent years, offering more confidence that additional resources could be found, he added.  The most watched exploration wells include BP and Kosmos Energy in Senegal, Total and Petrobras in Brazil, Exxon in Guyana, Total and Pemex in Mexico and Eni in Cyprus, according to WoodMac.  The growing appetite for exploration was made clear last October when the top oil companies vied for blocks in Brazil\u2019s first deepwater oil auction for foreign operators, where Shell was awarded half of the blocks.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence that the world\u2019s top two economies were on a solid growth track pushed emerging stocks to fresh 6-1/2 year highs on Thursday, while higher oil prices underpinned crude exporters.  Global equities hit a new high following record closes on Wall Street on Wednesday,, helped by robust growth numbers and a rally in energy stocks.  Tensions in key oil producer Iran and ongoing OPEC-led output cuts have pushed oil prices to their highest in over 2-1/2 years.  U.S. factory activity increased by more than expected in December, boosted by a surge in new orders growth, while China\u2019s services sector activity expanded at the fastest pace in more than three years.  MSCI\u2019s benchmark emerging equities index rose 0.4 percent, with Chinese mainland shares up 0.5 percent to over one-month highs, Warsaw up 1.7 percent to a six-week high, Prague up 1 percent to a 6-1/2 year high and Russian shares up 0.7 percent.  Strong economic data out of Germany and the broader euro zone added to the benign backdrop for Eastern Europe.  \u201cEverything seems to point to a positive start, the risk appetite is good, you have FX rallying, you have equity markets rallying \u2013 it is a typical start to the new year with people taking up risk again,\u201d said Paul Fage, a strategist at TD Securities.  In Turkey, Halkbank shares surged as much as 4.7 percent before giving up most of these gains, after a U.S. jury found a Halkbank executive guilty of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Halkbank said the banker had the right to appeal against the verdict. Halkbank dollar-denominated bonds were little changed.  The almost four-week trial has strained relations between the U.S. and Turkey, which said the decision was \u201cunjust and unfortunate\u201d.  The Turkish bank sector index and the broader market were both up around 0.5 percent, while the lira firmed 0.4 percent against the dollar.  \u201cThe market has taken pretty much no notice of it,\u201d Fage said. \u201cThe whole thing is really about what the consequences will be for the relationship between Turkey and the U.S., and it is hard to know at this precise moment in time.\u201d  He was sceptical it would really have a substantial long-term negative market impact.  The South African rand firmed 0.8 percent against the dollar, shrugging off data showing South Africa\u2019s private sector economic activity contracted for a fifth consecutive month in December, hitting a 20-month low.  Meanwhile Angola\u2019s central bank said it would abandon its currency peg against the U.S. dollar from this month, setting the stage for the kwanza to fall sharply to match its value on the streets.  NKC African Economics said the change may not address domestic product shortages in the short-term. \u201cHence, the net impact will be inflationary given that a certain proportion of imports are no longer subsidised at a stronger exchange rate,\u201d analyst Cobus de Hart said in a note.

          "title": "Tony Blair tells UK voters: time is running out to stop Brexit folly",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Former British prime minister Tony Blair told voters on Thursday that time was running out to reverse Brexit, a folly that he said would torpedo Britain\u2019s remaining clout and be regretted for generations to come.  More than a year and a half since the 2016 Brexit vote, the United Kingdom remains deeply divided over the planned EU exit that Prime Minister Theresa May says will take place on March 29, 2019.  Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the divorce is Britain\u2019s most significant geopolitical move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the $2.5 trillion UK economy and the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc.  Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said Britain would be poorer and weaker, and he warned that May had solved none of the problems over Northern Ireland\u2019s post-Brexit status.  \u201cWe are making an error the contemporary world cannot understand and the generations of the future will not forgive,\u201d Blair said in an article published on his website on Thursday.  \u201c2018 will be the last chance to secure a say on whether the new relationship proposed with Europe is better than the existing one,\u201d Blair, 64, said.  Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: just over 15 years ago, British leaders such as Blair were arguing about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the reserve of skeptics on the fringes of both major parties.  But the turmoil of the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration and a series of miscalculations by former prime minister David Cameron prompted the United Kingdom to vote 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in a June 2016 referendum.  Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing other critics such as French President Emmanuel Macron and billionaire investor George Soros, who have suggested that Britain could still change its mind.  So far, opinion polls show little sign of a change of heart among voters on Brexit and it is unclear how it could be stopped if both major political parties support the divorce.  Supporters of Brexit accused Blair of undermining both  Britain\u2019s negotiations with the EU and the will of the people.   \u201cBlair and his elitist gang are damaging our negotiating strength, thus damaging our national interest by their continuing efforts to undermine democracy,\u201d said Richard Tice, who helped found one of the two Leave campaign groups.  \u201cHistory will not forgive them,\u201d Tice told Reuters.  Blair is unpopular in Britain for his decision to back then-U.S. President George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq and the justification he used for going into a war that cost the deaths of 150,000 Iraqi civilians and 179 British soldiers.  Blair implored his Labour Party, which is now led by veteran leftist Jeremy Corbyn, to join the fight to stop Brexit.  \u201cMake Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100 percent,\u201d Blair said. \u201cIf Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the Single Market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour.\u201d  Corbyn, who voted against membership of the EU in a 1975 referendum, said he voted in 2016 to remain in the bloc, though opponents said he did not campaign strongly in the referendum.  Eight out of 10 grassroots Labour Party members want a referendum on the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, according to a survey published on Thursday.  The survey of attitudes within Britain\u2019s main political parties showed 49 percent of Labour members definitely wanted a second referendum on the exit deal and a further 29 percent said they were more in favour of the idea than against it.  The poll of more than 4,000 members of political parties was conducted shortly after last June\u2019s national election as part of a three-year academic project by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London.

          "body": "ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Thursday sentenced a lawmaker from the pro-Kurdish opposition party to 16 years and 8 months in prison, broadcaster CNN Turk and other media said, nearly one year after his arrest over terror charges.  Idris Baluken, a lawmaker for the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP), was first jailed pending trial in a terrorism-related investigation in November 2016. He was later released in January 2017 and arrested again one month later.  Baluken and other detained HDP members, including the party\u2019s co-leaders, are mostly accused of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, which has conducted a decades-old insurgency against the Turkish state. All of the accused have denied the charges.  About 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended and roughly 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial since a 2016 failed coup. The HDP says as many as 5,000 of its members have been detained.  Rights groups and some Western allies say President Tayyip Erdogan has used the putsch as an excuse to quash dissent, but the government argues the purges are necessary to thwart the threats it is facing.

Trabzon Port, which operates the port in the northeastern Turkish city of Trabzon, is, in turn, operated by Turkey\u2019s Albayrak Group, which has interests in construction and media. Following the listing of Trabzon Port, Albayrak aims to list all of its group companies, Chief Executive Omer Bolat said at a news conference in Istanbul.  The Trabzon Port listing is due to be completed this month. The IPO price values the port operator at 325.5 million lira, Trabzon Port said.  Turkey\u2019s public offering market has gained momentum lately with planned large IPOs lined up for 2018. Foreign investor interest dimmed after the 2016 coup attempt, which caused some firms to postpone plans for listing.  Last year, private equity firm Turkven listed jeans retailer Mavi, a 1.17 billion lira floatation that was widely seen as a test of international demand. The shares have surged some 30 percent since its June listing.  Initial public offering of large firms like energy distributor Enerjisa and healthcare provider Medical Park as well as the stock exchange Borsa Istanbul are planned to be completed this year.

Services PMI data showed the euro area was near its best growth in seven years, while services growth in Italy and Spain beat the previous flash estimates.  Banks Santander (SAN.MC), BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and ING (INGA.AS) were among the top boosts to the STOXX as increasing enthusiasm about the euro zone\u2019s recovery helped push money into financial stocks.  \u201cThe continued strength and breadth of the business surveys is encouraging,\u201d said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, adding the improvement in Italian PMIs was a positive heading into the election.  \u201cWe continue to believe that the outlook for European equities is positive, aided by the potential for close to ten percent earnings growth in 2018,\u201d Bell added.  The improving economic backdrop drove analysts to hold back on downward revisions for euro zone company earnings as they awaited the beginning of the fourth-quarter results season.  Better-than-expected U.S. car sales data and rising oil prices also drove auto and energy stocks higher.  Germany's DAX .GDAXI led the way with a 0.9 percent gain thanks to strong carmakers and industrials, while Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE hit a record high.  U.S. car sales data for December beat analysts\u2019 expectations, driving European automakers .SXAP up 1.5 percent, leading sector gainers.  Italian carmaker Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) rose 4 percent to hit a record high, among top STOXX gainers, while Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) led the DAX.  \u201cDefensive sectors, industrials, energy and IT could offer interesting opportunities,\u201d said Romain Boscher, co-head of equities at Amundi. On small- and mid-caps Boscher said he remained positive on cyclical themes.   Remy Cointreau (RCOP.PA) was a rare laggard, down 2.9 percent after Investec downgraded the stock, saying Chinese anti-corruption measures could affect consumption of costly status symbol products like cognac.

          "body": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Singapore-based Vickers Venture Partners is looking to raise its largest fund yet of up to $500 million later this year as it seeks to increase investment in biotechnology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI), said its chairman, Finian Tan.  The venture capital firm is already looking for investors to participate in its Fund VI, Tan said in an interview.  \u201cIt\u2019s not so soon (but) we are soft-marketing right now, looking for anchor investors for our new fund,\u201d he told Reuters.  At $500 million, Fund VI will be one of the largest venture capital funds to be raised in Southeast Asia.  Singapore-based venture capital firms, which benefit from government incentives, have enjoyed robust fundraising in 2017. Fundraising in the island city has attracted foreign investors ranging from family offices to corporate backers who want a finger in the technology investment space.  Vickers adopts a largely non-thematic strategy globally but is keen to ride on the growth it sees in biotechnology, nanotechnology and AI, Tan said.  \u201cIn these three megatrends, if you follow them and invest in them, the growth will be exponential,\u201d he said.  The firm closed its fifth fund of $230 million in October. Of that, it has committed to about $130 million in deals and expects another $20 million worth to be closed soon.  \u201cWe still have some reserves for follow-on investments, and we probably have space for perhaps another seven new deals,\u201d he said.  Biotechnology is the best-performing sector in Vickers\u2019 portfolio, achieving a multiple of more than 10 times for the firm, Tan said, due largely to an investment five years ago in San Diego-based regenerative medicine technology company Samumed LLC, a unicorn startup valued at $12 billion.  The current average valuation multiple across its first four funds is 5.8 times, with a net internal rate of return of 37 percent.  \u201cAll our life science investments are in the U.S. and U.K. currently, but we plan to invest more in Asia,\u201d he said.  Tan\u2019s investment track record includes China\u2019s Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) five years before it went public - a deal he entered as then-head of Asia at DFJ Eplanet Ventures, and which has since become the one he is most recognized for.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers increased their borrowing by the smallest amount since mid-2015 in the three months to November, suggesting households are slowly reining in spending, Bank of England figures showed on Thursday.  Britain\u2019s economy saw lackluster growth for most of 2017 - especially compared to its faster-growing neighbors - and Thursday\u2019s BoE data suggest this pattern continued toward the end of the year.  The central bank said unsecured consumer lending in the three months to November grew at an annualized rate of 8.5 percent, down from 9.3 percent in the three months to October and its weakest since June 2015.      The BoE has played down any suggestion of a debt bubble, though it has acknowledged pockets of risk and required banks to set aside more money against the risk of bad loans.   In cash term, borrowing was up by 1.4 billion pounds in November alone, compared with economists\u2019 forecasts of a 1.5 billion pound rise in a Reuters poll.  Net mortgage approvals for house purchase were at the higher end of economists\u2019 forecasts at 65,139 in November compared with 64,887 in October.  Earlier on Thursday major mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices overall last year grew at their slowest pace since 2012 and fell in London for the first time since 2009.  The central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in November, reversing a cut made in August 2016, and indicated that further increases were likely in the coming years to keep inflation under control.  Figures last week from industry group UK Finance showed mortgage approvals by major banks dropped to a 15-month low.      Consumer credit growth has been slowing gradually since it peaked at nearly 11 percent in November 2016.   With Britain\u2019s consumers being squeezed by slow wage growth and the jump in inflation that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, expectations for Christmas spending had been subdued.  However, major clothing retailer Next (NXT.L) reported stronger than expected Christmas sales on Wednesday and the Confederation of British Industry said sales growth had been solid in the early part of December.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s dominant services sector grew unexpectedly quickly last month and businesses are more upbeat about 2018 than they were for much of 2017, but Brexit is weighing on investment plans, a survey showed on Thursday.  The IHS Markit/CIPS service Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) rose to 54.2 in December, its second-highest reading since April, beating forecasts in a Reuters poll that it would remain at November\u2019s 53.8.  Along with surveys of construction and manufacturing published this week, the economy looks as if it grew 0.4 to 0.5 percent in the last three months of 2017, faster than in the previous quarter, IHS Markit said.  Official data for most of 2017 showed Britain lagging behind other countries with the weakest year-on-year growth since 2013 in the third quarter. Consumer spending took a hit from high inflation caused by the 2016 Brexit vote and slow wage growth.  However, British retailers - who are not included in the PMI - have so far reported solid sales over the Christmas period.  Major clothing chain Next (NXT.L) said on Wednesday that colder-than-usual weather had given an extra boost to demand.  Thursday\u2019s PMI data showed that services firms were upbeat about 2018. More than 40 percent expect stronger sales this year, and just 10 percent see a fall, the most optimistic split since May.  \u201cHowever, as has been increasingly the case in recent months, the good news comes with a health warning about the sustainability of the upturn,\u201d said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit\u2019s chief economist.  The inflow of new orders slowed to its weakest since August 2016, partly due to worries about the terms on which Britain will leave the European Union in March 2019, IHS Markit said.  \u201cDigging into the details behind the resilient strength signaled by the headline numbers, the survey data reveal an economy that is beset with uncertainty about the outlook, which is in turn dampening business spending and investment,\u201d Williamson said.  The survey showed companies hired people at the slowest rate since March 2017, while input costs rose at their fastest in three months.  \u201cThere were also reports that uncertainty about the path to Brexit continued to weigh on growth, particularly in terms of clients\u2019 willingness to commit to new projects,\u201d Markit said.  The survey was conducted from Dec. 5 to 19, so included responses both before and after Prime Minister Theresa May gained agreement from the EU to move Brexit talks on to discuss transitional arrangements and a longer-term trade deal.

          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Aharon Appelfeld, a prolific Israeli novelist and Holocaust survivor whose works examined the lost world of European Jews and the new lives they pursued in Israel, died on Thursday. He was 85.  Writing in Hebrew, the Romanian-born Appelfeld penned more than 40 books and was one of Israel\u2019s most widely translated authors.  Appelfeld\u2019s \u201cBlooms of Darkness\u201d, the tale of an 11-year-old boy hidden from the Nazis by a prostitute, won the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in London in 2012. Appelfeld was also awarded the State of Israel Prize for Literature in 1983 and was a Man Booker International Prize finalist in 2013.  Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, on Twitter, expressed sorrow \u201cabout the passing of our beloved writer\u201d.  Amos Oz, one of Israel\u2019s most prominent novelists, said on Army Radio that Appelfed shied away from graphic depictions of the Holocaust, choosing instead to describe its effect on the lives of his characters.  \u201cAppelfeld never wrote about gas chambers, never wrote about executions, about mass graves, atrocities and experiments on human beings. He wrote about survivors before and after. He wrote about people who did not know what was about to happen to them and about people who already knew everything but hardly spoke about it,\u201d Oz said on Army Radio.    \u201cHe didn\u2019t want, or he was unable, to write depictions of the horrors - he said that too. They are beyond the ability of human language to express them. You have to approach them indirectly, tiptoeing from afar,\u201d said Oz, once Appelfeld\u2019s student in a kibbutz.  Appelfeld was a young boy when his mother was killed by the Nazis. He and his father were sent to a concentration camp in Transnistria in an area of Ukraine then under control of the German-allied Romanian forces. Aged 10 at the time, he escaped and spent three years hiding in forests in Ukraine.  \u201cI survived in the fields and forests. Sometimes I worked as a shepherd or taking care of broken-down horses,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1986. \u201cI lived with marginal people during the war - prostitutes, horse thieves, witches, fortune tellers. They gave me my real education.\u201d  After the war, he immigrated to Israel - he learned Hebrew beforehand - and when he was 28 he discovered that his father had survived and they were reunited in Israel.   \u201cEven though I spent time on kibbutzim that tried to change me, I did not change. I remained, basically, the Jewish refugee child who survived,\u201d he said in an interview with Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper in 2015.  American-Jewish author Philip Roth once described Appelfeld as a \u201cdisplaced writer of displaced fiction, who made displacement and disorientation a subject uniquely his own\u201d.  Works by Appelfeld translated into English include \u201cBadenheim 1939\u201d (1978), a tale set in a fictional Austrian resort on the eve of World War Two, and \u201cThe Immortal Bartfuss\u201d (1988), a fictional portrait of a troubled survivor in Israel.

          "body": "FOFONGA, India (Reuters) - Marzina Bibi, a Muslim woman living in India\u2019s northeastern state of Assam, is petrified she will be declared stateless.  The 26-year-old\u2019s name was not on a preliminary list of citizens that was published at midnight on Sunday, although she holds a voter identity card and had voted in state elections in 2016.  \u201cWhy are they doing this to me?\u201d Bibi asked, sitting beside a bamboo mat she was weaving outside her mud house in Assam\u2019s Fofonga village. \u201cThey think I am a Bangladeshi. I was born here, my parents were born here, I am an Indian.\u201d  Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which came to power in Assam in the April, 2016 elections, vowed during the campaign to act against illegal Muslim immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh. But rights activists say the drive is also targeting Muslims who are Indian citizens.  Two national spokesmen for the BJP declined to comment.  A spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi did not reply to e-mails and a telephone call seeking comment.  Citizenship and illegal migration are volatile issues in tea-growing and oil-rich Assam, home to more than 32 million people, about a third of whom are Muslims. Hundreds of people were killed in the 1980s in a violent protest by a native Assamese group against outsiders from the state taking the bulk of jobs and cornering resources, including land.  For the latest update of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), all residents of Assam had to produce documents proving that they or their families lived in the country before March 24, 1971, to be recognized as Indian citizens.  According to the preliminary list of the NRC, about 19 million people in Assam have now been verified as Indian citizens. More names will be added, and officials say the final list is likely to be published in July.  Reuters spoke to nearly two dozen Muslims, including Bibi, from paddy-growing villages around Fofonga who said their names were not on the preliminary list.  \u201cI feel we are targeted because we are Muslims,\u201d said Bibi,     who said she has already proved she was Indian  - she was jailed for eight months on charges of being an illegal migrant from Bangladesh and was let off only after showing documents attesting to her nationality.  Surrounded by her neighbors in the village, she showed her voter identity card and the court order for her release from jail.  The BJP has said previous governments have included many Bangladeshi immigrants on electoral rolls to buy votes.  At the local NRC office in the Muslim-majority area, only around 4,500 people had made it to the preliminary list out of  nearly 11,000 who had applied.   The government officer in charge of the center, Gautam Sharmah, said there was no religious bias against Muslims.  \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. We only look at documents,\u201d Sharmah said at his office, as people trickled in to look for their names on the second day of the list\u2019s publication. \u201cThe time taken in the verification process depends on what kind of documents people submit.\u201d  Reuters saw a tribal Hindu man leaving the NRC office with a smile after being told that the names of all six members of his family were on the list. Soon after, two Muslim women came with their infants, and left disappointed.  Hundreds of thousands of people fled to India from Muslim-majority Bangladesh after it declared independence from  Pakistan on March 26, 1971, setting off a nine-month civil war. Most of them settled in Assam and the neighboring state of West Bengal, where there are similar demands to send back illegal Muslim immigrants.  The migrants include many Hindus, but the federal BJP government has said they will not be deported.  Himanta Biswa Sarma, Assam\u2019s finance minister who is also in charge of the citizenship register, told Reuters that all those whose names do not figure in the final NRC list would be segregated.  \u201cDeportation is an issue handled by the central government,\u201d Sarma said.  \u201cHindu Bangladeshis who had faced persecution should be given shelter in India and that is the central government\u2019s stand.\u201d  Muslims leaders have called the NRC a tool to make them stateless, likening themselves to Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority. They have also warned of unrest.  Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told the Times of India daily that the \u201cpeople who are declared foreigners will be barred from all constitutional rights, including fundamental and electoral. They will have only one right \u2014 human rights as guaranteed by the U.N. that include food, shelter and clothing\u201d.  In Fofonga, Bibi said she would challenge the list if it did not include her and her family as citizens.  \u201cWe are poor people, my husband is a laborer,\u201d she said, going back to weaving her mat. \u201cBut I will go to court if we are left out.\u201d  Reporting by Krishna N. Das; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan"

          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Aharon Appelfeld, a prolific Israeli novelist and Holocaust survivor whose works examined the lost world of European Jews and the new lives they pursued in Israel, died on Thursday. He was 85.  Writing in Hebrew, the Romanian-born Appelfeld penned more than 40 books and was one of Israel\u2019s most widely translated authors.  Appelfeld\u2019s \u201cBlooms of Darkness\u201d, the tale of an 11-year-old boy hidden from the Nazis by a prostitute, won the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in London in 2012. Appelfeld was also awarded the State of Israel Prize for Literature in 1983 and was a Man Booker International Prize finalist in 2013.  Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, on Twitter, expressed sorrow \u201cabout the passing of our beloved writer\u201d.  Amos Oz, one of Israel\u2019s most prominent novelists, said on Army Radio that Appelfed shied away from graphic depictions of the Holocaust, choosing instead to describe its effect on the lives of his characters.  \u201cAppelfeld never wrote about gas chambers, never wrote about executions, about mass graves, atrocities and experiments on human beings. He wrote about survivors before and after. He wrote about people who did not know what was about to happen to them and about people who already knew everything but hardly spoke about it,\u201d Oz said on Army Radio.    \u201cHe didn\u2019t want, or he was unable, to write depictions of the horrors - he said that too. They are beyond the ability of human language to express them. You have to approach them indirectly, tiptoeing from afar,\u201d said Oz, once Appelfeld\u2019s student in a kibbutz.  Appelfeld was a young boy when his mother was killed by the Nazis. He and his father were sent to a concentration camp in Transnistria in an area of Ukraine then under control of the German-allied Romanian forces. Aged 10 at the time, he escaped and spent three years hiding in forests in Ukraine.  \u201cI survived in the fields and forests. Sometimes I worked as a shepherd or taking care of broken-down horses,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1986. \u201cI lived with marginal people during the war - prostitutes, horse thieves, witches, fortune tellers. They gave me my real education.\u201d  After the war, he immigrated to Israel - he learned Hebrew beforehand - and when he was 28 he discovered that his father had survived and they were reunited in Israel.   \u201cEven though I spent time on kibbutzim that tried to change me, I did not change. I remained, basically, the Jewish refugee child who survived,\u201d he said in an interview with Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper in 2015.  American-Jewish author Philip Roth once described Appelfeld as a \u201cdisplaced writer of displaced fiction, who made displacement and disorientation a subject uniquely his own\u201d.  Works by Appelfeld translated into English include \u201cBadenheim 1939\u201d (1978), a tale set in a fictional Austrian resort on the eve of World War Two, and \u201cThe Immortal Bartfuss\u201d (1988), a fictional portrait of a troubled survivor in Israel.

          "body": "* Move is part of 2.11 trillion-rupee bank recap unveiled in Oct  * Finance Ministry: Bank recap to not entail any cash outgo  * Shares of state banks jump on the news (Adds finance ministry comment, share movement)  NEW DELHI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Indian government asked parliament on Thursday for 800 billion rupees ($12.62 billion) that it plans to spend by March as part of a two-year programme to recapitalise state banks to help them deal with bad debts and revive credit growth.  In October, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced the plan to recapitalise the 21 banks with 2.11 trillion rupees, including 1.35 trillion rupees through recapitalisation bonds and 580 billion rupees from share sales by state-run banks.  The lenders which are majority-owned by the government have more than two-thirds of India\u2019s banking assets. These banks also account for the bulk of the sector\u2019s record $150 billion in bad loans, a major factor choking new credits, after years of profligate lending.  The banks also face higher capital requirements as mandated by the global Basel III banking rules to be fully implemented by March 2019.  On Thursday, the finance ministry presented the planned expenditure for state bank recapitalisation in the fiscal year ending in March in the lower house of parliament. It said this would not entail any cash outgo after taking into account the receipts on issue of securities to the banks.  Bank shares rose on the move, with the Nifty public sector bank index rising 2 percent by 0911 GMT in a Mumbai market that was up 0.4 percent.  Some of the state-run banks with high bad loans - Dena Bank , UCO Bank and IDBI Bank - jumped between 7 percent and 8 percent.  Neither the finance ministry nor the central bank has given a breakdown, by bank, of the recapitalisation sum. Under the current plan, banks are supposed to subscribe to the bonds and the government will invest the funds raised in return for equity in the banks.  Earlier on Thursday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said it expected all the 21 state banks to meet the minimum Basel III requirement of 8 percent common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by March 2019, aided by the recapitalisation.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s largest privately held biotech company, Germany-based BioNTech, has raised $270 million to support its work in developing personalized immunotherapies for cancer, ahead of an expected eventual stock market flotation.  Overall, the company has brought in close to $950 million since it was founded in 2008 \u2014 taking account of initial seed funding, grants and partnership deals with big drugmakers \u2014 giving it war chest to finance operations well into 2019.  Chief Operating Officer Sean Marett told Reuters the group would go public at some stage, given the capital-intensive nature of its business, although an initial public offering (IPO) was unlikely this year.  \u201cInevitably, in the end we will IPO just because of the size and the capital demands required by individualized approaches to treatment. You have to invest enormously in manufacturing,\u201d he said.  BioNTech hit the headlines in July when its experimental personalized cancer vaccine, tailored to the tumors of individual patients, kept disease in check in an early-stage clinical trial.   The approach offers a way to widen the use of a new generation of immunotherapy drugs from the likes of Merck & Co (MRK.N), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Roche (ROG.S) that currently only work for a limited number of patients.  By adding a personalized cancer vaccine, scientists believe it should be possible to improve substantially the effectiveness of such immune-boosting medicines.   BioNTech has already signed a $310 million deal with Roche allowing the Swiss drugmaker to test the vaccine with its marketed immunotherapy drug Tecentriq.  The individualized vaccine uses so-called messenger RNA to carry code for making mutated proteins that are specific to a patient\u2019s tumor, prompting specialist T-cells to step up their attack on cancer cells.  BioNTech, which has around 700 employees at sites in Germany \u2014 more than any other unlisted biotech firm in Europe \u2014 is also working on other cancer-fighting technologies, including antibodies, cell therapies and small molecules.  In addition to the deal with Roche\u2019s Genentech unit, it has corporate partnerships with Eli Lilly (LLY.N), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Genmab (GEN.CO) and Bayer Animal Health (BAYGn.DE).  Mainz-based BioNTech has yet to make a profit and has been bankrolled for the past decade by majority owners Thomas and Andreas Struengmann, who sold their generic drugs business Hexal to Novartis (NOVN.S) in 2005.  The latest Series A financing, announced on Thursday, includes a fresh commitment by the Struengmanns, alongside investments from Redmile Group, Janus Henderson Investors, Invus, Fidelity and other European family offices.

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - Robert Bosch GmbH, the German auto supplier and engineering group, said on Thursday it had agreed to buy a 5 percent stake in HERE, the digital mapping firm jointly controlled by carmakers BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen\u2019s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi.  Privately held Bosch did not disclose financial terms for the deal, expected to close by the end of March, subject to regulatory approvals.  The German carmaker consortium acquired HERE from Finnish telecoms group Nokia (NOKIA.HE) for 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in 2015, in part to avoid becoming dependent on third-party mapping providers such as Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google, a competitor in the race to develop self-driving cars. Chip maker Intel (INTC.O) also holds a 15 percent stake.  Bosch\u2019s disclosure referred to plans by HERE to increase its diversification into non-automotive applications - a move that could help offset risks and uncertainties surrounding the eventual arrival of fully autonomous cars for the mass market.  \u201cBosch is more than cars,\u201d Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said in the statement. He said the company saw \u201csynergies with data-based services for Industry 4.0, smart homes and smart cities\u201d - terms broadly describing the use of technology platforms to find efficiencies everywhere from the factory floor to road traffic management.  Rival auto supplier Continental (CONG.DE) has also expressed interest in buying a HERE stake.  A group of investors led by Chinese mapping firm Navinfo (002405.SZ) and internet giant Tencent (0700.HK) in September canceled a previously announced plan to buy 10 percent of HERE, after failing to win U.S. approval.

          "title": "Japan faces greatest danger since World War due to North Korea: PM",
          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - The security situation facing Japan is the most perilous since World War Two because of North Korea\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d provocations, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Thursday and he vowed to bolster defenses to protect the Japanese people.  Tension in the region has been rising, particularly since North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in September, and then in November, said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach all of the U.S. mainland.  \u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that the security environment surrounding Japan is at its severest since World War Two. I will protect the people\u2019s lives and peaceful living in any situation,\u201d Abe told a New Year news conference.  Abe said Japan would take new steps to strengthen its defense posture but he did not go to specifics.  The government approved a record military budget last month, with defense outlays due to rise for a sixth year, increasing by 1.3 percent to 5.19 trillion yen ($46 billion), with the biggest item 137 billion yen in reinforcing defenses against North Korean ballistic missiles.  The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said this week the United States was hearing reports that North Korea might be preparing to fire another missile, and she warned it not to.  \u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that North Korea is trampling the strong desire of Japan and the rest of the international community for peaceful resolutions and continuing with its provocative behavior,\u201d Abe said.  Abe has said he wants to amend Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution with the aim of loosening constraints on the military, although the public is divided over changes to the charter imposed after Japan\u2019s World War Two defeat.  War-renouncing Article 9 of the constitution, if read literally, bans the existence of standing armed forces, but has long been interpreted to allow a military for exclusively defensive purposes.    Abe said he wanted more debate on the issue.  \u201cI would like this to be a year in which public debate over a constitutional revision will be deepened further,\u201d he said.  Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition retained its two-thirds \u201csuper majority\u201d in parliament\u2019s lower house in an Oct. 22 election, re-energizing his push to revise the constitution.

Privately held Bosch did not disclose financial terms for the deal, expected to close by the end of March, subject to regulatory approvals.  The German carmaker consortium acquired HERE from Finnish telecoms group Nokia (NOKIA.HE) for 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in 2015, in part to avoid becoming dependent on third-party mapping providers such as Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google, a competitor in the race to develop self-driving cars. Chip maker Intel (INTC.O) also holds a 15 percent stake.  Bosch\u2019s disclosure referred to plans by HERE to increase its diversification into non-automotive applications - a move that could help offset risks and uncertainties surrounding the eventual arrival of fully autonomous cars for the mass market.  \u201cBosch is more than cars,\u201d Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said in the statement. He said the company saw \u201csynergies with data-based services for Industry 4.0, smart homes and smart cities\u201d - terms broadly describing the use of technology platforms to find efficiencies everywhere from the factory floor to road traffic management.  Rival auto supplier Continental (CONG.DE) has also expressed interest in buying a HERE stake.  A group of investors led by Chinese mapping firm Navinfo (002405.SZ) and internet giant Tencent (0700.HK) in September canceled a previously announced plan to buy 10 percent of HERE, after failing to win U.S. approval.

          "body": "* Philippines\u2019 credit-to-GDP ratio still relatively low  * Central bank closely monitoring property market, big firms  * Central bank ready to deploy measures to prevent overheating (Adds quotes, more comments, background)  MANILA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Philippine central bank is closely monitoring levels of credit and leverage especially in sectors where there could be pockets of \u201cexcessive\u201d lending, as it seeks to keep the economy from overheating, its governor said on Thursday.  Nestor Espenilla, governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, however, said the overall assessment points to an economy still far from being overheated, with its credit-to-GDP ratio of around 63 percent still one of the lowest in Asia.  \u201cThe question is how broad (credit growth) is, or is it just happening in certain parts,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIf that is the case, then we use finer instruments like regulatory policy.\u201d  Adjusting interest rates was not necessary in such a situation because its impact would be economy-wide and blunt, he said, after speaking on the domestic economy\u2019s prospects in 2018 at a civic group meeting.  The central bank was keeping a close eye on the property market and large companies, in particular, he said.  Commercial banks\u2019 outstanding loans have been growing at a double-digit pace for several months now, exceeding 20 percent at some point, driven mainly by lending to the real estate sector, among industries, central bank data showed.  \u201cWe stand prepared to deploy appropriate measures such as macroprudential policies to prevent economic overheating,\u201d Espenilla said.  But while the central bank remains confident that inflation would be within the government\u2019s 2-4 percent target this year until 2019, he said further crude oil price increases may result in inflation hovering in the upper bracket of that range.  Some economists expect the central bank to start raising the key benchmark rate from 3 percent this year to tame price pressures that may arise from higher taxes, strong growth and a rise in oil prices.  \u201cYou can count on us to timely adjust the monetary policy stance to ward off any threat to our inflation target,\u201d Espenilla said. \u201cWe have enough instruments in our toolkit to address the challenges that could arise.\u201d  The central bank has left policy setting unchanged since it raised interest rates by 25 basis points in September 2014. In June 2016, it set the main rate at 3 percent when it moved to an interest rate corridor framework. (Reporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)"

          "body": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai court on Thursday jailed a blind woman for 1-1/2 years for violating the country\u2019s royal insult law, her lawyer and a court official said.  Thailand\u2019s lese-majeste law is the toughest in the world, and those judged guilty of breaking it face up to 15 years in jail for each count of offending the king, queen, heir or regent.  Nurhayati Masoh, 23, was found guilty after she posted on her Facebook account an article by Giles Ungpakorn, a Thai-British academic and vocal opponent of the Thai monarchy who fled Thailand after he was charged with lese majeste in 2009.  \u201cShe confessed that she posted it,\u201d Kaosar Aleemama, a lawyer for Nurhayati, told Reuters. \u201cBut she did not realize it would lead to such a harsh punishment.\u201d   Nurhayati, who uses a computer application that helps the visually impaired to post on social media, was arrested in November and sentenced to three years in jail by a court in the southern province of Yala.  \u201cThe case against her was filed on November 28, 2017 and she has been detained since,\u201d an official at the Yala Provincial Court, who declined to be named, told Reuters.  Nurhayati\u2019s confession led to her sentence being halved, he added.  Thailand\u2019s military, which took control of government in a May 2014 coup, has ramped up online censorship, particularly of perceived insults to the monarchy.   Since the coup, at least 94 people have been prosecuted for lese majeste. As many as 43 people have been sentenced, says the iLaw group that monitors royal insult case, with 92 percent of them pleading guilty in hopes of receiving a shorter jail term.   \u201cThere may be more cases that we do not know about,\u201d Yingcheep Atchanont, iLaw\u2019s project manager, told Reuters.   The laws protecting members of the royal family from insult limit what all news organizations, including Reuters, can report from Thailand.  The United Nations has expressed concern over what it calls a deteriorating rights situation in Thailand, including harsh sentences for those convicted of violating the lese-majeste law, known as Article 112.   The junta has said it needs to crack down on critics of the monarchy for the sake of national security.

The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of six major currencies, slipped to its lowest since Sept. 20 on Tuesday, as optimism about the euro zone economy drove the single currency above $1.20 for the first time in 3-1/2 months.  The U.S. currency was given some reprieve on Wednesday, bouncing after strong manufacturing and construction data. It gained further support from the Fed\u2019s latest minutes, which indicated the central bank is still poised to raise interest rates several times this year.  But by 0824 GMT on Thursday it was back in negative territory, with its index down 0.1 percent on the day.  The euro had dipped in early trade in Asia, reaching $1.2005, but it then bounced back to trade at $1.2029, up 0.1 percent on the day.  \u201cWe see some very positive euro sentiment in the market right now, and if it goes down too much against the U.S. dollar that\u2019s going to begin again... The market is not confident enough right now that levels below $1.20 are justified,\u201d said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt.  \u201cThat might change with the U.S. employment data coming in strong,\u201d she said, adding that U.S. wages numbers due on Friday could be key in determining the dollar\u2019s direction.  In the minutes from their Dec. 12-13 meeting, Fed policymakers acknowledged the U.S. labour market\u2019s solid gains and the expansion in economic activity, even as they affirmed worries about persistently low inflation.  That suggested the central bank will continue to pursue a gradual approach to raising rates but could hasten the pace if inflation accelerates.  The U.S. currency was higher against the yen, trading up 0.2 percent at 112.655 yen on strong risk appetite across markets. It touched a 2-1/2-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday after declining steadily from a high above 113.750, scaled in December.  Buoyed by overnight gains on Wall Street, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei began the first day of trading in 2018 by rallying 2.5 percent.  Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, expects dollar/yen to stay around 110 yen in the medium term.  \u201cYen demand stemming from Japan\u2019s current account surplus will be checked by yen selling pressure stemming from \u2018risk-on\u2019 generated by global economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cDollar/yen is likely to remain in range around 110 yen amid this tug-of-war.\u201d  Bitcoin was down almost 5 percent on the Bitstamp exchange at around $14,430, having lost more than a quarter of its value since hitting record highs in mid-December.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China will keep its target for economic growth at \u201caround 6.5 percent\u201d in 2018, unchanged from last year, policy sources told Reuters, as it seeks to balance efforts to reduce debt risks while keeping the world\u2019s second-largest economy stable.  The proposed target, to be unveiled at the annual parliament meeting in March, was endorsed by top leaders at the closed-door Central Economic Work Conference in Dec. 18-20, according to four sources with knowledge of the meeting outcome.  Where Beijing\u2019s policymakers set the speedometer on their closely-managed economy is always of crucial interest to global investors because of China\u2019s role as an engine of growth for the world.  Past stimulus policies to stop growth flagging as the global economy passed through a sticky few years resulted in  massive borrowing by state-run firms and local governments.   Total debt in the second quarter of last year amounted to 255.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product, according to Bank for International Settlements estimates.   And policymakers are on a mission to reduce the risk of any  crisis erupting out of the mountain of debt as the country makes its gradual transition from a command to a market economy.     \u201cThe economic growth target will still be around 6.5 percent as they favor stability,\u201d said one source who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.  China\u2019s State Council Information Office, the government\u2019s public relations arm, had not yet responded to Reuters\u2019 request for comment on the economic targets for this year.  There have been some doubts whether China would be putting a number on its target for 2018, as President Xi Jinping pledged in October to pursue \u201chigh quality growth\u201d.  And while Chinese leaders remain committed to meeting a goal set by their predecessors of doubling GDP in the decade to 2020, to turn China into a \u201cmodestly prosperous\u201d nation, a senior Communist Party official said in October that goal would not be set for the following decade.  Analysts expect final numbers will show the economy grew around 6.8 percent in 2017, beating the target thanks to strong global demand for Chinese exports, and just bettering the 26-year low of 6.7 percent posted in 2016.   To hit the 2020 goal, the economy needs to expand at least  6.3 annually over the next three years, officials have said.  The government will maintain a 3 percent inflation target for 2018, the sources said, suggesting policymakers are not foreseeing any sharp price rises, as factories struggle to pass on higher costs to consumers.  November consumer inflation slowed to 1.7 percent, while producer price rises eased to a four-month low of 5.8 percent.   While staying upbeat about export prospects, policymakers, according to the sources, are wary of the impact from expected increases in U.S. interest rates and President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cut plans, which might make it more difficult for China to lure foreign investment if U.S firms repatriate more earnings.  The government plans keep a budget deficit target of 3 percent of GDP this year in line with a pro-active fiscal policy, spending more on infrastructure, new sectors and social welfare, according to the sources.  The central bank is likely to keep its grip on money supply this year to reflect its \u201cprudent and neutral\u201d policy, but no rises in benchmark interest rates are expected soon after a recent increase in borrowing costs for non-financial firms.  \u201cMonetary policy will be relatively tight to help deleverage, and risk-controls and fiscal policy will be relatively loose to focus on structural needs,\u201d said a second source.  In November, China\u2019s broad M2 money supply growth quickened to 9.1 percent from a record low of 8.8 percent in October but remained below the annual target of around 12 percent.   The central bank has said slowing M2 growth could be a \u201cnew normal\u201d as regulators crack down on riskier banking activities.  But the crackdown has forced banks to lend more to households and businesses, with new loans hitting a record 12.94 trillion yuan ($1.99 trillion) in January-November.  Beijing has made some progress this year reducing  corporate debt, which fell to 163.4 percent of GDP in the second quarter from 166.8 percent a year earlier, according to the BIS data.   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and some economists have urged China to do away with growth targets to reduce the economy\u2019s long reliance on debt-fuelled stimulus.  And last month, Ma Jun - former chief economist at the central bank - said that China should replace this year\u2019s GDP target with an unemployment rate.  Chinese officials have argued that such growth targets are not mandatory and Beijing has been improving the way it assesses local officials\u2019 performance by adding environmental costs and debt levels to dilute GDP\u2019s dominance.  Still, growth targets remain central to policymakers\u2019 thinking and many state firms still look to Beijing\u2019s guidance.  \u201cWe should have a data system that puts more emphasis on high-quality growth, but scrapping growth targets completely would go too far,\u201d said one of the sources.

Gains spanning cyclical sectors including industrials and banks drove the pan-European STOXX 600 up 0.5 percent while euro zone stocks and blue-chips rose 0.6 percent.  Germany\u2019s DAX led the way with a 0.9 percent gain thanks to strong carmakers and industrials, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hit a record high.

          "body": "* France and Spain to sell up to 14.5 bln eur of bonds  * Bond yields higher across bloc  * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr  By Dhara Ranasinghe  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Borrowing costs in the euro area crept higher on Thursday as investors readied for new bond supply from France and Spain in what is traditionally one of the busiest issuance months of the year.  In their first auctions of 2018, France plans to sell up to 9.5 billion euros of long-dated bonds and Spain up to 5 billion euros of medium and long-term debt.  Investors often pull down bond prices, pushing up yields, ahead of an auction to make way for new supply.  Bond yields across the single currency bloc were up 1-2 basis points in early trade.  With new cash being put back to work at the start of the year, analysts expected the new supply to be easily absorbed by markets.  Ireland raised 4 billion euros on Wednesday with a syndicated 10-year bond that covered around a quarter of its 2018 issuance target just three days into the year. It received over 14 billion euros worth of orders, lead bankers for the deal said.  Yields on French and Spanish 10-year bonds were around 1 basis point higher. In Germany, the bloc\u2019s benchmark bond issuer, 10-year bond yields were up 1.5 bps at 0.46 percent and holding within sight of recent two-month highs.  \u201cThere could be some slight upward pressure on bond yields from the auctions but I don\u2019t see any lasting impact,\u201d said DZ Bank rates strategist Daniel Lenz.  Analysts said trading volumes had been slightly lower on Wednesday as sweeping new financial rules, known as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, came into force.  But they added that the strong Irish sale had cheered investors, providing an incentive to push yields down.  Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting released late on Wednesday showed Fed policymakers see future rate rises guided by inflation and fiscal stimulus.  \u201cWe think the discussion at the Fed indicates little opposition to raising rates in March and to pressing ahead with balance sheet reduction thanks to easy financial conditions,\u201d analysts at Mizuho said in a note.

          "body": "ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Mongolia has delayed until 2019 the completion of a long-awaited $500-million airport project, originally expected this year, the transport minister said, a setback in efforts to diversify a mining-dependent economy.  To reduce its dependence on commodities such as coal and copper, Mongolia has ambitions to become an air freight hub for northern Asia and wants to develop tourism.   But the new airport is unlikely to open this year as originally scheduled, Roads and Transportation Minister Jadamba Bat-Erdene said, as Mongolia negotiates a management contract with Japanese investors.  \u201cThe airport was expected to be operational this year, but plans are for it to be operational within the next year, due to management issues,\u201d he said on the ministry\u2019s official website.  \u201cIt is planned to set up a joint management team headed by Japan,\u201d he said in the statement, without elaborating.   The new airport is intended to replace the Chinggis Khan (Genghis Khan) International Airport, and take the name of the country\u2019s 13th-century ruler, regarded as a national symbol.  Mongolia will be able to receive 3 million passengers a year by 2024 at the new airport, about 50 km (31 miles) from Ulaanbaatar, the capital. Its predecessor, a one-way runway built near a mountain range, is prone to disruptions and flight cancellations.  Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Corp. and Chiyoda are leading construction, with Samsung C&T acting as a subcontractor.  The Chinese Export-Import Bank is providing $140 million to finance a 32.2-km (20-mile) road to the airport. Now under construction, the road is set to be completed by October.  The International Monetary Fund encouraged Mongolia to diversify away from mining as part of a $5.5-billion bailout agreed last year to stabilize its crisis-hit economy.  Coal was the biggest driver of growth in 2017, but exports were hit by transport bottlenecks at the border with China, Mongolia\u2019s biggest customer.  Although the airport could generate non-mining growth, its success could depend on Mongolia allowing more airlines into the market and ending favorable treatment for the state carrier, analysts have said.

          "body": "YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar\u2019s civilian president called in an Independence Day speech on Thursday for reform of a military-drafted constitution and for justice for all recognized minorities under a federal system, but made no mention of the treatment of its Rohingya Muslim people.  Amending the charter to remove a dominant political role for the military has been one of the most contentious issues facing Myanmar as it emerges from nearly half a century of strict army rule.  The debate over constitutional reform, however, has been muted since the assassination in January last year of a lawyer advising government leader Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s ruling party on the issue.  \u201cAs we build the Democratic Federal Republic, in accordance with the results of the political dialogues, we all need to work collectively for creating a suitable constitution,\u201d President Htin Kyaw said in his speech marking the 70th anniversary of Myanmar\u2019s independence from Britain.  Htin Kyaw\u2019s post is largely ceremonial but he is a close ally of Suu Kyi. He did not elaborate on what he meant by suitable or spell out why he was suggesting the 2008 constitution drawn up by the military was unsuitable.  The constitution bars Suu Kyi from becoming president because it rules out candidates with a foreign spouse or child. Suu Kyi\u2019s late husband was British as are her two sons.  It also reserves for the military one quarter of the seats in parliament and several major cabinet posts, including defense, interior and border affairs, giving it an effective veto over constitutional change and control of security affairs.  Myanmar began emerging from 49 years of military rule in 2011. Suu Kyi\u2019s party swept a 2015 election and formed a government but concern is growing that the reform program is stalling or even sliding back.  This has been compounded by attacks on press freedom, including the detention of several journalists over the past year. On Dec. 12, the authorities arrested two Reuters reporters who had covered the army crackdown that has led to the mass flight of Rohingya residents of Rakhine State across the border into Bangladesh.   Htin Kyaw called for respect for human rights but he did not refer to the crisis over the exodus of 655,000 Rohingya people, nor to the international condemnation it has generated.  \u201cWe are working for the emergence of a democratic state based on the principles of freedom for all ethnic national races, justice, equality and right of self-determination,\u201d he said.  \u201cNational race\u201d is a term used by Myanmar referring to what it categorizes as indigenous ethnic groups. The Rohingya, who have traditionally lived in Rakhine, have been denied inclusion as authorities regard them as illegal immigrants who have crossed over from Bangladesh.  The Rohingya crisis erupted in late August after Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts in Rakhine triggered a fierce military response that the United Nations denounced as ethnic cleansing.  Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing saying its security forces have mounted legitimate clearance operations.  Htin Kyaw called for an end to conflict with insurgents from various ethnic minorities who have been battling for autonomy for decades.  Clashes have flared in recent weeks between the army and guerrillas in Kachin and Shan states in the north.  Myanmar\u2019s minorities have long demanded self-determination under a federal system. The army has traditionally seen itself as the only institution preventing the country\u2019s disintegration and has favored a unitary state.  Amending the constitution would not be easy.  Changes require a 76 percent majority vote in a parliament dominated by military members and their allies.  The killing of lawyer and constitutional expert Ko Ni last year has not been fully explained even though the gunman was caught at the scene.   Many activists believe Ko Ni, who was Muslim, was targeted for his efforts to reduce the military\u2019s political role.  Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore"

          "body": "(Adds details, CEO quote)  Jan 4 (Reuters) - Saga has restructured its travel business, after the British tourism and insurance group for the over 50s said last month that its tour operations had been hit by the collapse of Monarch Airlines.  Saga said on Thursday that Robin Shaw had been appointed CEO of Saga Travel. Shaw was previously CEO of Saga Cruises and will now head both the tour and cruise operations.  The company also said Jeannette Linfoot, managing director of its tour operations, had left the business and Gary Duggan would take over from Roger Ramsden as head of Saga Services, its retail broker.  \u201cThese changes provide us with a more focused executive team as we target and invest in growth in the Saga customer base to achieve our long-term ambitions,\u201d Group CEO Lance Batchelor said in a statement.  In an unscheduled trading update last month, Saga said that its tour operations business had been hit by the collapse of Monarch, with a one-off cost of about 2 million pounds ($2.7 million).  Britain\u2019s Monarch Airlines collapsed in October, causing the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of holidays, after falling victim to intense competition for flights and a weaker pound.  As a result, Saga, which used Monarch, said it expected underlying pretax profit would rise by just 1-2 percent in 2017 and fall 5 percent in 2018.  At the time Batchelor also said the cost of leasing aircraft had risen as a result of Monarch\u2019s collapse as competitors rushed to fill the gap and raised prices.

          "body": "ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Mongolia has delayed until 2019 the completion of a long-awaited $500-million airport project, originally expected this year, the transport minister said, a setback in efforts to diversify a mining-dependent economy.  To reduce its dependence on commodities such as coal and copper, Mongolia has ambitions to become an air freight hub for northern Asia and wants to develop tourism.   But the new airport is unlikely to open this year as originally scheduled, Roads and Transportation Minister Jadamba Bat-Erdene said, as Mongolia negotiates a management contract with Japanese investors.  \u201cThe airport was expected to be operational this year, but plans are for it to be operational within the next year, due to management issues,\u201d he said on the ministry\u2019s official website.  \u201cIt is planned to set up a joint management team headed by Japan,\u201d he said in the statement, without elaborating.   The new airport is intended to replace the Chinggis Khan (Genghis Khan) International Airport, and take the name of the country\u2019s 13th-century ruler, regarded as a national symbol.  Mongolia will be able to receive 3 million passengers a year by 2024 at the new airport, about 50 km (31 miles) from Ulaanbaatar, the capital. Its predecessor, a one-way runway built near a mountain range, is prone to disruptions and flight cancellations.  Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Corp. and Chiyoda are leading construction, with Samsung C&T acting as a subcontractor.  The Chinese Export-Import Bank is providing $140 million to finance a 32.2-km (20-mile) road to the airport. Now under construction, the road is set to be completed by October.  The International Monetary Fund encouraged Mongolia to diversify away from mining as part of a $5.5-billion bailout agreed last year to stabilize its crisis-hit economy.  Coal was the biggest driver of growth in 2017, but exports were hit by transport bottlenecks at the border with China, Mongolia\u2019s biggest customer.  Although the airport could generate non-mining growth, its success could depend on Mongolia allowing more airlines into the market and ending favorable treatment for the state carrier, analysts have said.

Nationwide said it expected growth in British house prices to slow further to just 1 percent in 2018.  Britain\u2019s housing market has weakened since the country voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. A fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit referendum pushed up inflation and added to pressure on the finances of many households.  Nationwide said British house prices rose by 2.6 percent in the 12 months to December, slower than growth of 4.5 percent in 2016 but stronger than a median forecast of a 2.0 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists.  In monthly terms, prices also rose more strongly than expected, up 0.6 percent from November and the biggest increase since June last year.  In London, prices fell by 0.5 percent in 2017 and the capital was the weakest region across Britain for the first time since 2004, Nationwide said.

He will replace Richard Baker, who will retire at the end of February.  Crozier joined Whitbread\u2019s board last April and became senior independent director in September.  He was credited with restoring ITV\u2019s fortunes by reducing its reliance on advertising and expanding its production business.  He also spent seven years at Royal Mail where he set about restructuring the postal business in the face of opposition from unions. Prior to that he led the English Football Association (FA).  Whitbread, which has been the subject of break-up speculation in the past, warned in April of a tougher consumer environment, as rising inflation and muted wage growth weighed on consumer spending.  Last month, U.S.-based hedge fund Sachem Head Capital Management declared a 3.4 percent stake in the British hotel and coffee chain operator.  Sachem Head has previously taken activist positions at companies, though it is unclear whether it will push for changes at FTSE 100 listed Whitbread.

          "body": "(Reuters) - The Houston Astros will visit the White House to be honored by United States president Donald Trump, a team staff member told the Houston Chronicle on Wednesday.  Astros\u2019 president of business operations Reid Ryan said the team had accepted a White House invitation, though the date was yet to be scheduled.  The Astros won baseball\u2019s World Series two months ago and it is customary for the winner of major sports champions in the U.S. to receive an invitation to the White House to meet with the president.  But these are not normal times, as evidenced by Trump\u2019s tweet in September rescinding an invitation to the National Basketball Association\u2019s champion Golden State Warriors.  This followed a disclosure by Golden State star guard Stephen Curry that he would vote not to visit if the team held a poll.  \u201cThis is a tradition and an honor. For many people, this might be their only time to ever be invited to the White House,\u201d Ryan told the Chronicle of the Astros\u2019 plans.  \u201cAnd as the representatives of baseball and the World Series champs, when the White House calls and invites you to come up, it\u2019s something that as an organization we felt both a responsibility and an obligation to be part of.\u201d  This does not necessarily mean every member of Houston\u2019s World Series-winning team will go.  The New England Patriots visited the White House after winning the Super Bowl earlier this year, but several team members skipped the trip.  Houston third baseman Alex Bregman, who called Trump a \u201cjoke\u201d before the 2016 presidential election, was recently asked whether he would accept an invitation.  \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m gonna do whatever Carlos Beltran and Carlos Correa do,\u201d Bregman said, referring to two of the team\u2019s players from Puerto Rico.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s largest privately held biotech company, Germany-based BioNTech, has raised $270 million to support its work in developing personalized immunotherapies for cancer, ahead of an expected eventual stock market flotation.  Overall, the company has brought in close to $950 million since it was founded in 2008 \u2014 taking account of initial seed funding, grants and partnership deals with big drugmakers \u2014 giving it war chest to finance operations well into 2019.  Chief Operating Officer Sean Marett told Reuters the group would go public at some stage, given the capital-intensive nature of its business, although an initial public offering (IPO) was unlikely this year.  \u201cInevitably, in the end we will IPO just because of the size and the capital demands required by individualized approaches to treatment. You have to invest enormously in manufacturing,\u201d he said.  BioNTech hit the headlines in July when its experimental personalized cancer vaccine, tailored to the tumors of individual patients, kept disease in check in an early-stage clinical trial.   The approach offers a way to widen the use of a new generation of immunotherapy drugs from the likes of Merck & Co (MRK.N), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Roche (ROG.S) that currently only work for a limited number of patients.  By adding a personalized cancer vaccine, scientists believe it should be possible to improve substantially the effectiveness of such immune-boosting medicines.   BioNTech has already signed a $310 million deal with Roche allowing the Swiss drugmaker to test the vaccine with its marketed immunotherapy drug Tecentriq.  The individualized vaccine uses so-called messenger RNA to carry code for making mutated proteins that are specific to a patient\u2019s tumor, prompting specialist T-cells to step up their attack on cancer cells.  BioNTech, which has around 700 employees at sites in Germany \u2014 more than any other unlisted biotech firm in Europe \u2014 is also working on other cancer-fighting technologies, including antibodies, cell therapies and small molecules.  In addition to the deal with Roche\u2019s Genentech unit, it has corporate partnerships with Eli Lilly (LLY.N), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Genmab (GEN.CO) and Bayer Animal Health (BAYGn.DE).  Mainz-based BioNTech has yet to make a profit and has been bankrolled for the past decade by majority owners Thomas and Andreas Struengmann, who sold their generic drugs business Hexal to Novartis (NOVN.S) in 2005.  The latest Series A financing, announced on Thursday, includes a fresh commitment by the Struengmanns, alongside investments from Redmile Group, Janus Henderson Investors, Invus, Fidelity and other European family offices.

The company said its British like-for-like sales at constant currency fell 2.6 percent in the 17 weeks to 30 December, and it had to cut prices to deliver sales growth in the six weeks up to Christmas.  It said its profit before tax for the year was now likely to be in the range of 55 million to 65 million pounds ($88 million).

          "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian benchmark thermal coal prices have pushed to their highest levels since 2016, fueled by demand in China and loading delays in Indonesia that have ramped up shipping congestion outside major coal ports.  Spot cargo prices for Australian Newcastle coal have risen nearly 15 percent from lows in late November after China loosened import restrictions to help meet a winter fuel shortage.  \u201cThe reason behind relaxing the restrictions was to ensure coal supplies at utilities, as some coal-fired power plants in eastern regions have been operating with minimum coal inventories,\u201d said Zhang Xiaojin, coal analyst at Everbright Futures.   The move by the National Energy Administration also followed an ambitious gasification program that moved too many households and factories from coal to gas for its utilities to keep up.  Traders said strong orders from India have also supported prices, which hit $105.65 per ton on Wednesday, the highest since November 2016.  \u201cIndia is buying throughout Q1, which means the shortage is not expected to end any time soon,\u201d said a coal trader with a major trading house, who declined to be named.  Bottlenecks at import terminals across China and delays at loading ports in Indonesia\u2019s Kalimantan island, one of the world\u2019s biggest thermal coal mining regions have added to the tighter market.  \u201cThe trouble to load in Kalimantan is a result of huge rainfalls. This has triggered replacement orders for supplies from Newcastle (Australia), pushing up prices there,\u201d said a second coal trader, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not allowed to comment on trading activity.  The congestion started in late 2017, and is getting worse.  Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows around 100 large dry-bulk ships waiting to load coal off the coast of Kalimantan, Indonesia, most of them at Samarinda and Taboneo.  Some ships have been waiting since late October, the data shows.  Even more ships are waiting to unload coal in China, where between 400 and 500 large dry-bulk carriers are waiting outside Shanghai/Ningbo and in the Gulf of Zhili, serving the ports of Tianjin, Coafeidian, Qinhuangdao and Bayuquan.  That\u2019s up from around 300 ships waiting outside both Chinese and Australian ports to load or deliver in late 2017.  Analysts expect tight market conditions to last until the Chinese New Year, which starts in February.  \u201cCongestion and supply-side delays have sent prices higher. We see seaborne coal price support for the winter through to the Chinese New Year, especially from China and India,\u201d said Shirley Zhang, principal analyst for Asian coal markets at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  However, in the longer term, prices should ease as China\u2019s import curbs are potentially restored, heading to $69 a ton by 2021 for Newcastle, Zhang said.  \u201cIn general, the Asian demand growth driver is shifting away from China toward India and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam,\u201d she said, where strong demand growth would require investment into coal.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Despite the strongest start for oil prices in four years, the world\u2019s top oil companies are hesitating to accelerate the search for new resources as a determination to retain capital discipline trumps the hope of making bonanza discoveries.  Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and their peers are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie (WoodMac), despite a growing urgency to replenish reserves after years of reining back investment.  (For graphic 'Global spending on oil and gas exploration' click reut.rs/2CjAONv)  Global investment in exploration, vital to increase output and offset the natural decline of existing fields, will reach $37 billion in 2018, down 7 percent from a year earlier and over 60 percent below the 2014 peak, according to WoodMac.  For majors, spending will collectively drop by around 4 percent this year to represent about a tenth of investment in oil and gas production, known as upstream.  \u201cThis could be the new normal, with the days of one dollar in six or seven going to exploration forever in the past,\u201d WoodMac said in a report.   The declines, however, mask a modest uptick in drilling activity as lower rig rates and a focused approach on well-charted basins allow firms to do more with their money, according to WoodMac analyst Andrew Latham.  \u201cInvestment will be down year-on year but activity will be flat to slightly higher,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  The collapse in oil prices in 2014 led to a deep retrenchment in spending for the sector, but companies still need to increase their resources as reserves dwindle.  As crude prices and profits recover - prices are currently above $65 a barrel, the highest since mid-2015 - the push to beef up reserves will only increase.   The exploration success rate has dropped from 40 percent to 35 percent over the past decade, highlighting the importance of acquisitions as an alternative, albeit generally more expensive, to build resources.  \u201cExploration spending (is) to remain low ... implying the need for more merger and acquisition\u201d activity, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said.  After spending more than $30 billion on acquisitions in 2017, oil Majors are expected to continue to make bolt-on purchases in areas where they already operate, even though the \u201cupstream M&A window is starting to close,\u201d RBC said, alluding to higher asset valuations and fewer distressed sellers.   The majors will once again be the ones to watch thanks to stronger balance sheets compared with smaller rivals, WoodMac\u2019s Latham said.   Exploration is expected to focus on deepwater basins such as Mexico, Brazil and Guyana where large discoveries have been made in recent years, offering more confidence that additional resources could be found, he added.  The most watched exploration wells include BP and Kosmos Energy in Senegal, Total and Petrobras in Brazil, Exxon in Guyana, Total and Pemex in Mexico and Eni in Cyprus, according to WoodMac.  The growing appetite for exploration was made clear last October when the top oil companies vied for blocks in Brazil\u2019s first deepwater oil auction for foreign operators, where Shell was awarded half of the blocks.

          "body": "* Oil, gold up on Iran unrest  * Volatility gauge near record low as investors see limited risk  * U.S. manufacturing sector survey, German jobless rate upbeat  * Fed minutes show policymakers unsure of tax cut plan impact  * European shares seen rising 0.2 - 0.6 pct  By Hideyuki Sano  TOKYO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares vaulted to 10-year highs on Thursday as solid economic data from the United States and Germany reinforced investors\u2019 optimism, while oil prices hovered at a 2-1/2-year high with unrest in Iran stoking supply disruption concerns.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent, extending its gains so far this year to 2.4 percent.  Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped 3.3 percent on its first trading day of the year, hitting its highest level in a quarter of a century.  \u201cThe economic data published over the holiday period has been pretty good. So for those who were worried about new year profit-taking, the market would look pretty strong,\u201d said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.  The economic data published on Wednesday on both sides of the Atlantic reinforced investors\u2019 expectations that solid global growth will boost demand of goods, including oil, and lift corporate earnings.  U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, boosted by a surge in new orders growth, in a further sign of strong economic momentum at the end of 2017.  In Germany, Europe\u2019s economic power house, the unemployment rate hit a record low of 5.5 percent in December, underpinning a broad-based economic upswing.  European shares are expected to gain, with spread-betters looking to a higher opening of 0.6 percent in Germany\u2019s Dax , 0.5 percent in France\u2019s Cac 40 and 0.2 percent in Britain\u2019s FTSE.  The world\u2019s stock markets, which had their best year since 2009 last year, hit a record high on Thursday, extending gains so far this week to 1.4 percent.  On Wednesday, the three main stock indexes on Wall Street hit record closes on Wednesday, helped by a 1.5 percent rise in energy stocks.  Oil prices hovered at 2-1/2-year highs as the anti-government protests in Iran that began last week rattled Tehran\u2019s clerical leadership and left 21 people dead so far, raising concerns about supply.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose to as high as $62.17 per barrel, up 0.9 percent for the day and their highest level since mid-2015.  International benchmark Brent futures also scaled a 2-1/2-year high of $68.19 a barrel.  \u201cOil appears to be traded at a premium compared to economic fundamentals because of concerns over development in Iran,\u201d said Motofumi Okoshi, senior economist at Nomura Securities.  At the moment, forward contracts are trading cheaper than expected spot prices, a condition known as backwardation, suggesting investors expect any supply shortages to be temporary.  \u201cIf conditions in Iran deteriorate further, I expect forward contracts will begin to be bought as well,\u201d Okoshi added.  Concerns about geopolitical instability are also supporting safe-haven gold, which fetched $1,310 per ounce, after hitting a 3-1/2-month high of $1,321.5 on Wednesday.  Still, investors are expecting financial markets to be stable overall, with Cboe Volatility index, which measures implied price volatility of U.S. stocks in the next one month, closing at 9.15, just above record closing of 9.14 touched on Nov. 3, and below its 2017 average of 11.09.  The volatility index has been kept at one of the lowest levels since the global financial crisis in 2008 primarily because investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve and the world\u2019s other major central banks will tighten monetary policy only gradually with few signs of inflation pressures building.  To be sure, inflation expectations indicated by the gap between 10-year U.S. inflation-linked bonds and conventional ones rose above two percent to the highest level since March.  Still, the minutes of the Fed\u2019s last policy meeting on Dec. 12-13 released on Wednesday did little to change that perception of measured monetary tightening.  The minutes showed that policymakers saw President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cut plans as providing a boost to consumer spending but also uncertainty over the impact of fiscal stimulus on raising price pressures.  Fed funds rate futures fell slightly, with the April contract pricing in about a 75 percent chance of a rate hike by March, compared with around 60 percent at the end of last year.  But markets are still not fully pricing in three rate increases many Fed officials expect this year.  In the currency market, the dollar ticked up 0.2 percent against the yen to 112.69 yen following upbeat U.S. data.  The euro was little changed at $1.2002, off its near four-month peak of $1.2081 set on Tuesday.  The common currency faces an immediate resistance at $1.2170, a 50 percent retracement of its fall from mid-2014 to early 2017.  \u201cWhen I look around the world to see if there are any distortions, one thing that strikes me is the euro zone\u2019s negative interest rates of 0.40 percent (when the euro zone economy is strong.) I would think that will have to be eventually adjusted and the euro will rise,\u201d said a senior currency trader at a major Japanese bank.  The European Central Bank last month stuck to its pledge to keep money pouring into the euro zone economy for as long as needed, but opposition from some rate setters is rising amid increased growth and inflation forecasts for the area.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Bradie Tennell performed a brilliant routine to take a narrow short program lead over sentimental favorite Mirai Nagasu in the ladies competition at the U.S. figure skating championships on Wednesday.  Under the microscope of the Olympic selectors in the last event before the team for Pyeongchang is picked, in-form teenager Tennell executed flawlessly in San Jose, California.  Tennell arrived at the championships as one to watch after finishing third at Skate America last month and she did not disappoint, notching the highest ever U.S. championships short program score of 73.79 points, ahead of Nagasu\u2019s 73.09.  \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that,\u201d the 19-year-old said in a post-routine interview. \u201cMy expectations were just to skate a clean program. I just ignored the whole Olympics aspect of it and skated how I know how.\u201d  Nagasu, meanwhile, failed to stick her signature jump in a nervous start to what she hopes will be Olympic redemption but still recovered to challenge Tennell.  The 24-year-old wept openly after being overlooked for the 2014 American team for Sochi, despite finishing third at the U.S. championships that year.  Four years after that crushing disappointment, Nagasu entered this year\u2019s championships with the distinction of being only the second American after Tonya Harding to land a triple Axel in international competition.  After a nervous warm-up, Nagasu started her routine with the triple Axel but stumbled upon landing, although she stayed on her feet. She regrouped, however, and was rewarded with the highest technical score of the night.  \u201cI think I did a great job. To go down in history is all I\u2019ve ever wanted,\u201d said Nagasu, who makes no secret of her desire to atone for 2014.  \u201cI wish I had the mental ability of (multiple gold medal-winning swimmer) Michael Phelps but I think my journey has been about getting up... I\u2019m so proud to still be here today.\u201d  Tennell and Nagasu are well clear of third-placed Karen Wang on 69.48, with triple national champion Ashley Wagner languishing down in fifth place on 65.94.  \u201cI\u2019ve head a really mental season, I\u2019m not going to lie about that,\u201d said Wagner, referring to her recent mediocre form.  \u201cThis was solid. You can lose an event in the short program and my main focus was to get through this, not get too far behind and get myself a close enough distance to make a real killing in the long.\u201d  The ladies\u2019 event concludes on Friday with the long program.  The first three finishers are not guaranteed of selection, as Nagasu discovered in 2014, but know a strong finish will be hard to ignore.   Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina"

The national observatory put China\u2019s snow alert on its second-highest level this week, state news agency Xinhua said. Parts of the central, northern and eastern regions could see up to 30 cm (12 inches) of snow, it said.  VariFlight said Hefei Xinqiao International Airport, Fuyang Xiguan Airport in eastern Anhui province, and Jining Qufu Airport in coastal Shandong province had been shut. Some runways at other airports had been closed, causing delays, it said.   Beijing Capital International Airport, one of China\u2019s busiest, was also experiencing some delays, it said.    China\u2019s National Meteorological Center has also urged domestic authorities to take precautions regarding roads, railways, electricity supplies and telecommunications, according to Xinhua.  The northwestern part of central Hubei province saw its first snowfall of 2018 on Wednesday.   Some highways were shut due to snow in central Henan province and northwestern Ningxia Autonomous Region. Snowfall in Xian, the capital of Shaanxi province, also led to the delay of many high-speed trains.  The meteorological center expects widespread rain or snow in China\u2019s central and eastern regions over the next week.  Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Paul Tait"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Bradie Tennell performed a brilliant routine to take a narrow short program lead over sentimental favorite Mirai Nagasu in the ladies competition at the U.S. figure skating championships on Wednesday.  Under the microscope of the Olympic selectors in the last event before the team for Pyeongchang is picked, in-form teenager Tennell executed flawlessly in San Jose, California.  Tennell arrived at the championships as one to watch after finishing third at Skate America last month and she did not disappoint, notching the highest ever U.S. championships short program score of 73.79 points, ahead of Nagasu\u2019s 73.09.  \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that,\u201d the 19-year-old said in a post-routine interview. \u201cMy expectations were just to skate a clean program. I just ignored the whole Olympics aspect of it and skated how I know how.\u201d  Nagasu, meanwhile, failed to stick her signature jump in a nervous start to what she hopes will be Olympic redemption but still recovered to challenge Tennell.  The 24-year-old wept openly after being overlooked for the 2014 American team for Sochi, despite finishing third at the U.S. championships that year.  Four years after that crushing disappointment, Nagasu entered this year\u2019s championships with the distinction of being only the second American after Tonya Harding to land a triple Axel in international competition.  After a nervous warm-up, Nagasu started her routine with the triple Axel but stumbled upon landing, although she stayed on her feet. She regrouped, however, and was rewarded with the highest technical score of the night.  \u201cI think I did a great job. To go down in history is all I\u2019ve ever wanted,\u201d said Nagasu, who makes no secret of her desire to atone for 2014.  \u201cI wish I had the mental ability of (multiple gold medal-winning swimmer) Michael Phelps but I think my journey has been about getting up... I\u2019m so proud to still be here today.\u201d  Tennell and Nagasu are well clear of third-placed Karen Wang on 69.48, with triple national champion Ashley Wagner languishing down in fifth place on 65.94.  \u201cI\u2019ve head a really mental season, I\u2019m not going to lie about that,\u201d said Wagner, referring to her recent mediocre form.  \u201cThis was solid. You can lose an event in the short program and my main focus was to get through this, not get too far behind and get myself a close enough distance to make a real killing in the long.\u201d  The ladies\u2019 event concludes on Friday with the long program.  The first three finishers are not guaranteed of selection, as Nagasu discovered in 2014, but know a strong finish will be hard to ignore.   Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina"

          "body": "TOKYO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rallied on the first trading day of 2018, with the Nikkei and Topix pushing to multi-decade highs as brokerage  and oil shares surged.  Catching up to overseas gains after the long Japanese New Year\u2019s holiday, the Nikkei share average finished up 3.26 percent at its session high of 23,506.33, its highest level since January 1992.  Thursday\u2019s gain was the Nikkei\u2019s biggest for one day since Nov. 10, 2016.  \u201cThe market was mostly domestically-driven in the morning, with foreign buyers emerging in the afternoon,\u201d said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities, who added that further gains were possible as the Nikkei topped a resistance point at 23,500.  The broader Topix added 2.55 percent to end at a session high of 1,863.82, its best level since November 1991.  Advancers outnumbered decliners 492 to 143, with 40 issues ending unchanged.  In 2017, the Nikkei gained 19.1 percent and the Topix rose 19.7 percent, as the stronger global economy as well as domestic political stability and the Bank of Japan\u2019s ultra-easy monetary policy underpinned Japanese corporate earnings.  On Thursday, gains in many sectors helped power brokerage shares, with the securities subindex surging 4.86 percent. Nomura Holdings added 3.16 percent and Daiwa Securities Group was up 3.82 percent.  Buoyant crude prices boosted the oil & coal subindex by 3.73 percent. JXTG Holdings added 3.99 percent and Cosmo Energy Holdings was 7.29 percent higher.  Crude oil futures rose about 2 percent on Wednesday to their highest in 2-1/2 years, lifted by unrest in OPEC member Iran and strong U.S. and German economic data  Semiconductor-related shares also outperformed, in line with their U.S. counterparts and PHLX Semiconductor Sector gains. Tokyo Electron shares rose 6.18 percent, and Screen Holdings shares were up 6.51 percent.  Nintendo shares climbed 4.90 percent. The Financial Times reported on Monday that game developer Niantic Inc plans to launch its blockbuster Pokemon Go augmented reality game, in which Nintendo has a stake, in China through a partnership deal with local company NetEase.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries shares were 2.57 percent higher, after the head of the company\u2019s aircraft unit said it was on track to deliver its repeatedly delayed commercial jet by mid-2020 despite risk of an order cancellation.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lottery-style drawing to determine the winner of a tied Virginia House of Delegates race will go ahead after a recount court on Wednesday rejected a bid by the Democratic candidate to reconsider its ruling that the race was a tie.  The Newport News Circuit Court\u2019s ruling clears the way for state election officials to hold a random drawing as planned on Thursday to choose Democrat Shelly Simonds or Republican incumbent David Yancey as the victor in the race.  Republicans hold a one-vote margin in the 100-seat House. If Simonds is picked, the chamber would be split 50-50 and force lawmakers into a rare power-sharing arrangement.  A recount had shown that Simonds won the Nov. 7 election by one vote, but a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey. Simonds filed a lawsuit asking the judges to reconsider the decision.  On Wednesday, the judges said the Democrat had failed to show their previous ruling was in error or unjust.  \u201cThe manifest injustice against which we must always guard is the chance that a single vote may not be counted,\u201d the panel said in an 11-page ruling.  An image filed in court showed that the disputed ballot had bubbles filled in beside both candidates, with a slash mark by Simonds\u2019 name.  The tied race in the 94th District came amid Democrats\u2019 historic gains in Virginia\u2019s statehouse elections in November. They were part of the party\u2019s first big wave of political victories since Republican Donald Trump won the White House in 2016.  Simonds called on Yancey to agree not to challenge the results of Thursday\u2019s drawing. After Yancey responded by saying he would follow the process laid out in state law, Simonds told reporters late Wednesday that \u201call options are on the table\u201d if she loses the drawing.  \u201cI am not prepared to give up,\u201d she said.  Officials are under pressure to resolve the issue with the legislature set to convene on Jan. 10 and elect a speaker. Republicans hold a majority in the state Senate, and Democrat Ralph Northam is set to be sworn in as governor on Jan. 13.  A second House race also remains in dispute. Voters filed a federal lawsuit over the election in the 28th District, where a Republican won after at least 147 ballots were found to be assigned to the wrong districts.

          "title": "South Korea's President Moon meets former 'comfort women'",
          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday met women who were forced to work in Japanese wartime brothels, days after their plight again cast a shadow over relations with Japan.  A South Korean panel set up to investigate a 2015 agreement with Japan on the thousands of girls and women forced to work in Japan\u2019s military brothels, euphemistically termed \u201ccomfort women\u201d by Japan, said the deal failed to meet their needs.      Moon said the 2015 deal, under which Japan apologized to victims and provided 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) to a fund to help them, was seriously flawed. Japan said any attempt to revise it could damage relations.  Eight of the women met Moon for lunch at the presidential compound, known as the Blue House, in Seoul, the president\u2019s office said in a statement.  \u201cWe told you the previous government\u2019s agreement was wrong and this issue hasn\u2019t been resolved,\u201d Moon told one of the women before the lunch.  \u201cIt\u2019s still not an easy situation to handle within our bilateral relationship.\u201d  Moon wanted to gauge the women\u2019s reaction to his government\u2019s position on the deal, the Blue House said.  Moon visited one of the women, Kim Bok-dong, separately in the morning as she was ill and unable to attend the lunch.  \u201cWe survived when bullets were raining down and we\u2019ll be able to get through this,\u201d Kim told Moon, the Blue House said.   The women want Japan to take legal, binding responsibility for its actions and Kim was scornful of the 2015 pay-out.  \u201cThe money should be sent back to Japan,\u201d she said.  South Korean activists estimate that there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean women forced to work in the brothels.  As of December, there are at least 32 surviving, according to a South Korean civic group set up to look after their rights.  It was the second time former \u201ccomfort women\u201d visited the Blue House during Moon\u2019s presidency after one was invited to a dinner when U.S. President Donald Trump visited in November.  Moon\u2019s announcement on the Japanese deal last week raised consternation in Japan, where media reported said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may decide not to visit South Korea for the Winter Olympics there next month.   South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said on Thursday it would seek final measures on the issue as quickly as possible while one ministry official told Reuters the measures could be finalised as early as next week.  Strained ties come as the U.S. allies are trying to cooperate on security in the face of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile development.  But their bitter history, including Japanese colonization of the Korean peninsula and the issue of the women, has regularly been a source of rancor between them.  Moon came to power in May after the removal of his disgraced predecessor, Park Geun-hye, whose conservative government was criticized for failing to fully consult victims over the 2015 settlement.

          "body": "DUBAI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Iranian Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi has urged the people of Iran to engage in civil disobedience and press on with nationwide protests that are posing the boldest challenge to its leaders since pro-reform unrest in 2009. The pan-Arab daily Asharq Al-Awsat quoted Iran\u2019s most famous human rights lawyer as saying Iranians should stay on the street and that the constitution gives them the right to protest.  Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards have deployed forces to three provinces to put down anti-government unrest after six days of protests that have rattled the clerical leadership and killed 21 people.  The protests, which began over economic hardships suffered by the young and working class, have evolved into a rising against the powers and privileges of a remote elite, especially supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  The demonstrations seem to be spontaneous and without a clear leader, cropping up in working-class neighbourhoods and smaller cities, but the movement also seems to be gaining traction among the educated middle class and activists who took part in the 2009 protests  Ebadi called on Iranians to stop paying water, gas and electricity bills and taxes and to withdraw their money from state banks to exert economic pressure on the government and so force it to stop resorting to violence and meet their demands.  \u201cIf the government has not listened to you for 38 years your role has come to ignore what the government says to you now,\u201d Asharq Al-Awsat quoted Ebadi as saying in an interview.  Ebadi, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, is one of a number of exiled critics of Iran\u2019s leadership.  The unrest has drawn sharply varied responses internationally, with Europeans expressing unease at the delighted reaction by U.S. and Israeli leaders to the display of opposition to Iran\u2019s clerical establishment.  In a sign of official concern about the resilience of the protests, Revolutionary Guards commander Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari said he had sent forces to Hamadan, Isfahan and Lorestan provinces to tackle \u201cthe new sedition\u201d.  Most of the casualties among protesters have occurred in those regions of the sprawling Islamic Republic.  The Revolutionary Guards, the sword and shield of Iran\u2019s Shi\u2019ite theocracy, were instrumental in suppressing an uprising over alleged election fraud in 2009 in which dozens of mainly middle-class protesters were killed. Khamenei condemned that unrest as \u201csedition\u201d.  Thousands of Iranians took part in pro-government rallies in several cities on Wednesday morning in a state-sponsored show of force aimed at countering the outpouring of dissent.  State television broadcast live footage of rallies where marchers waved Iranian flags and portraits of Khamenei, Iran\u2019s paramount leader since 1989.  The leader of Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah group, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, played down the protests as economic discontent, saying they were not rooted in the political issues that spurred huge numbers to demonstrate in 2009 and would end soon.  He described them as \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d.  Reporting by Michael Georgy; Editing by Paul Tait"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Drinking alcohol produces a harmful chemical in the body which can lead to permanent genetic damage in the DNA of stem cells, increasing the risk of cancer developing, according to research published on Wednesday.  Working with mice in a laboratory, British scientists used chromosome analysis and DNA sequencing to examine the genetic damage caused by acetaldehyde, a harmful chemical produced when the body processes alcohol.  Their findings offered more detail about how alcohol increases the risk of developing 7 types of cancer, including common forms such as breast and bowel cancer. It also showed how the body seeks to defend against the damage alcohol can do.  \u201cSome cancers develop due to DNA damage in stem cells. While some damage occurs by chance, our findings suggest that drinking alcohol can increase the risk of this damage,\u201d said Ketan Patel, a professor at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, who co-led the study.  The World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, citing \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d it causes cancer in humans.   A study published in 2011 found that alcohol is responsible for around 4 percent of all cancer in Britain - equating to around 12,800 cases a year.  In Wednesday\u2019s study, published in the journal Nature, Patel\u2019s team gave diluted alcohol to mice and then analyzed the effect on the animals\u2019 DNA. They found that acetaldehyde can break and damage DNA within blood stem cells, permanently altering the DNA sequences within these cells.  This is important, Patel said, because when healthy stem cells become faulty, they can give rise to cancerous cells.  The researchers also looked at how the body tries to protect itself against damage caused by alcohol. The first line of defense is a group of enzymes called aldehyde dehydrogenases or ALDHs, Patel explained. These break down the acetaldehyde into acetate, which cells can then use as a source of energy.  In the study, when mice lacking a critical ALDH enzyme were given alcohol, their DNA suffered four times as damage compared with mice with a properly functioning version of the enzyme.  Patel said cells also have a second line of defense in the form of a range of DNA repair systems which, most of the time, allow them to fix and reverse different types of DNA damage.   But in some instances and in some people - particularly people from South East Asia - the repair systems fail to work, meaning their cells are unable to repair effectively.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that alcohol clearance and DNA repair systems are not perfect, and alcohol can still cause cancer in different ways - even in people whose defense mechanisms are intact,\u201d Patel said.

George, a native of nearby Palmdale, Calif., who is rumored to be interested in signing with the Lakers as a free agent next offseason, tied for the team high with 24 points.  Terrance Ferguson poured in 24 points with six 3-pointers in his first career NBA start in place of Andre Roberson, who was sidelined due to a knee injury.  Reigning NBA MVP Russell Westbrook, who played in college at UCLA, had 20 points, 12 assists and six rebounds. Carmelo Anthony added 21 for the Thunder, all in the first half.  Oklahoma City (21-17) shot a blistering 60.2 percent from the field to snap a two-game skid that followed a six-game winning streak.  Kyle Kuzma scored 18 points to pace the Lakers. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 12, Jordan Clarkson 11 and Corey Brewer 10 as Los Angeles (11-26) lost its eighth straight.  After missing eight games because of an ankle injury, Lakers center Brook Lopez returned to score 10 points and grab five rebounds in 16 minutes.  The Lakers were again without No. 2 overall pick and starting point guard Lonzo Ball, who missed his seventh consecutive game due to a sprained left shoulder.  Ball has been cleared to practice and will do so Thursday with the intent of returning for the Friday home game against the Charlotte Hornets.  Both Lopez and Ball were officially questionable for the Wednesday game.  The Thunder led 63-44 at halftime after pulling away in the second quarter, outscoring the Lakers 37-18 in the period.  Lopez\u2019s 3-pointer with 8:38 to play in the second put Los Angeles up 34-32. The game was tied at 35 at the 8:09 mark before Oklahoma City effectively put the contest away with an 18-4 surge. The Thunder ended the half on a 28-9 run.  That trend continued in the third as the Thunder posted a 33-26 advantage and coasted to victory in the fourth.  Los Angeles scored the first 10 points of the game but was outscored 26-16 after that as Oklahoma City pulled into a tie after one quarter.

          "body": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish prosecutors have issued arrest warrants for 70 people, including 58 serving soldiers, in an investigation targeting supporters of the U.S.-based cleric accused of orchestrating an attempted coup in July 2016, state media said on Thursday.  The operation was focused on the central Turkish province of Konya, with police carrying out simultaneous raids at addresses across 27 provinces, state-run Anadolu news agency reported.   Twelve of the 70 suspects had previously been expelled from the Turkish armed forces, Anadolu said.  Police operations to detain suspects accused of links to the Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen have been a near daily occurrence since the failed putsch of July 15, 2016, in which Gulen has denied any involvement.  Since then more than 50,000 people, including thousands of security personnel and civil servants, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs.  Rights groups say the crackdown has been exploited to muzzle dissent. The government says the measures have been necessary due to the security threats which Turkey has faced since the failed coup, in which 250 people were killed.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia said on Thursday it planned to become the fourth country in the world to legalise medicinal marijuana exports in a bid to score a piece of the estimated $55 billion global market.   Cannabis cultivation in Australia is still relatively small, as recreational use remains illegal. But the government hopes domestic medicinal use, legalised last year, and exports will rapidly boost production.  \u201cOur goal is very clear: to give farmers and producers the best shot at being the world\u2019s number one exporter of medicinal cannabis,\u201d Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters in Melbourne.  Shares in the more than a dozen Australian cannabis producers listed on the local exchange soared after the announcement.  Cann Group ended the day up 35 percent; AusCann Group rose nearly 54 percent; and BOD Australia closed up  about 39 percent. All were record highs for those companies. Hydroponics Company finished up 30 percent, hitting its highest price in five weeks.  Peter Crock, chief executive of Cann Group, which cultivates cannabis for medicinal and research purposes, said medicinal marijuana production had been stymied by limited demand from Australian patients.  \u201cWhile the Australian patient base is growing, it is very small,\u201d Crock told Reuters. \u201cBeing able to export will allow us to have the scale to increase production.\u201d  Hunt said the new legislation would include a requirement that growers first meet demand from local patients before exporting the remainder of their crop.  Despite growing demand, only Uruguay, Canada and the Netherlands have so far legalised the export of medicinal marijuana. Israel has said it intends to do so within months.   The Australian government\u2019s proposal needs to pass federal parliament when it returns to session in February. The country\u2019s main opposition Labor Party has signalled it would support the move.  Exports would then likely begin within months.  Fuelled by a growing acceptance of the benefits of marijuana to manage chronic pain, moderate the impact of multiple sclerosis and to soften the effects of cancer treatment, several countries and 29 states in the United States have legalised cannabis for medicinal use.  Australia\u2019s chief commodity forecaster does not publish data on cannabis production, but rough estimates by the University of Sydney estimated the legal industry at A$100 million ($78 million), well below the C$4 billion ($3.19 billion) that Canada estimates its market to be worth.

          "body": "CHARLESTON, S.C./BOSTON (Reuters) - A rare type of winter storm hit the U.S. Southeast on Wednesday, dumping snow on Florida\u2019s capital for the first time in three decades and snarling travel, while New England braced for a \u201cbombogenesis\u201d blizzard forecast to bring heavy accumulations on Thursday.  The governors of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia declared states of emergency, warning residents to expect icy roads and freezing temperatures. In the northeast, work crews loaded trucks with road salt in advance of the storm.  The New York City Department of Education said it would close public schools Thursday because of severe weather. The National Weather Service predicted New York could see 5-8 inches of snow and wind gusts as high as 50 mph on Thursday.  Much of the eastern United States is in the grips of a sustained cold spell that has frozen parts of Niagara Falls on the American and Canadian sides, played havoc with public works causing pipes to freeze and water mains to burst, and impeded firefighting in places where temperatures barely broke 20 degrees Fahrenheit.  The cold has been blamed for at least nine deaths over the past few days, including two homeless people in Houston. Police in Roseville, Michigan, said on Wednesday that a 96-year-old woman, recently diagnosed with dementia, was found dead in a playground, apparently having frozen to death after wandering outside in a robe and slippers.  The National Weather Service had blizzard warnings in effect from Virginia to Maine, with areas around Boston expected to see about a foot (30 cm) of snow on Thursday.   Snow would fall quickly during the day, at a rate of several inches per hour, with the storm intensified by the \u201cbombogenesis\u201d effect, private forecaster Accuweather warned.  \u201cBombogenesis,\u201d also known as a \u201cbomb cyclone,\u201d occurs when a storm\u2019s barometric pressure drops by 24 millibars in 24 hours, greatly strengthening the storm.  The effect is seen along the Northeastern coast every winter, but this storm will be particularly powerful, said Judah Cohen, a visiting scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  \u201cThis one is unique in how quickly the pressure is going to fall,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe pressures could rival a Category 1 or Category 2 hurricane.\u201d  An arctic air mass will remain entrenched over the eastern two-thirds of the United States through the end of the week.   At a news conference, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster warned people in the eastern part of the state to stay indoors if possible and to keep pets indoors.  \u201cIf they can\u2019t get in the heat, they\u2019ll freeze to death and they\u2019ll be gone,\u201d McMaster said. \u201cAnd the same thing will happen to people. So you have to be careful about that.\u201d  In the state\u2019s historic city of Charleston, the winter storm shuttered carriage-horse tour companies after a horse slipped and fell on ice during a tour on Tuesday, city spokesman Jack O\u2019Toole said.  The wintry mix and low wind chills caused widespread power outages and icy roads, making commuting treacherous for millions of Americans from northern Florida to southern Virginia, the National Weather Service said.  The storm was starting to snarl air travel in the southern United States, with about 50 percent of flights canceled at airports in South Carolina\u2019s Charleston and Myrtle Beach and Savannah, Georgia, according to the FlightAware tracking service.  The weather service said its Tallahassee office had measured snow and sleet accumulation of 0.1 inch (2.5 mm) on its roof, the first snow in Florida\u2019s capital since 1989.  Elsewhere, the city of Sumter, South Carolina, received 7 inches (18 cm) of snow and the community of Ellabell in eastern Georgia had 6 inches (15 cm) of snow, said meteorologist Patrick Burke of the federal Weather Prediction Center.  Boston Mayor Marty Walsh ordered schools closed on Thursday, warning city residents that the peak of the storm would occur during the day, making travel extremely dangerous.  \u201cBoth rush hours will be affected,\u201d Walsh told a news conference. \u201cBe patient. With the amount of snow we\u2019re getting here, we could be plowing your street and a half hour later it could look like we haven\u2019t been there.\u201d  Additional reporting by Chris Kenning and Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago, Bernie Woodall in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee, Gina Cherelus in New York and Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Leslie Adler"

          "title": "Trump breaks with Bannon, says former White House aide 'lost his mind'",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump blasted former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon on Wednesday as having \u201clost his mind\u201d in the fallout over damaging comments Bannon made about Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. in excerpts from a new book.  Trump, who had continued to speak privately with Bannon after firing him in August, essentially cut ties with his former aide at least for now in a blistering statement issued after Bannon\u2019s comments came to light.  \u201cSteve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,\u201d Trump said.  Trump had relied heavily on Bannon, chairman of the right-wing Breitbart News website, for advice in the months leading up to his upset victory in the November 2016 election.   Bannon helped Trump shape a populist, anti-establishment message and has been the president\u2019s link to his conservative base of support. It was not clear if the split would push Bannon to be even more aggressive in his campaign against the Republican establishment and whether he would now also target Trump, or would emerge much weaker.  According to excerpts from \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff, to be released on Tuesday, Bannon described a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d The meeting was arranged by the president\u2019s son and attended by top Trump campaign officials.  Trump has in the past praised Bannon for his friendship, but the president said in his statement on Wednesday Bannon had little to do with his election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, calling him \u201ca staffer who worked for me\u201d after he had already won the Republican nomination.  The president said Bannon was to blame for the loss of a Republican-held U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in December when Republican Roy Moore, whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, lost to Democrat Doug Jones. Trump and Bannon backed Moore in the campaign.   \u201cNow that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn\u2019t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,\u201d Trump said.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had been upset over Trump\u2019s backing of Moore at the urging of Bannon, was clearly pleased Trump was willing to rid himself of the former aide. McConnell\u2019s campaign organization posted on Twitter an image of the normally taciturn senator with a beaming smile.  Donald Trump Jr. attacked Bannon in a tweet.  \u201cSteve had the honor of working in the White House & serving the country. Unfortunately, he squandered that privilege & turned that opportunity into a nightmare of backstabbing, harassing, leaking, lying & undermining the President. Steve is not a strategist, he is an opportunist,\u201d he said.  The president, an expert at self-promotion, said Bannon was trying to promote himself by \u201cleaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was.\u201d  \u201cSteve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books,\u201d said Trump, who famously values loyalty in associates and employees.  Lawyers for the president sent a cease and desist letter to Bannon on Wednesday. They said in the letter, seen by Reuters, Bannon had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump, his family members and the campaign and made disparaging remarks about Trump and his family.  With elections looming in November that could cost Republicans control of Congress, Trump praised Republican lawmakers and candidates, words likely to be welcomed by McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan.  \u201cLike me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down,\u201d Trump said.  As with much in the Trump White House, the story that triggered the harsh back-and-forth was an offshoot of the investigation into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia to sway the election to Trump, allegations Trump and Moscow deny.  Bannon expressed derision about the June 2016 meeting in which a Russian lawyer was said to have offered damaging information about Clinton, according to the book.  The meeting was attended by Trump\u2019s son, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Bannon was also quoted as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians who took part in the meeting to meet his father in Trump Tower.   \u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers,\u201d Bannon said in the book in excerpts seen by Reuters.  \u201cEven if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately,\u201d he said.  When an intermediary proposed the meeting, saying the Russians were offering damaging information about Clinton, Trump Jr. responded in an email: \u201cI love it.\u201d  Bannon was incredulous about the meeting shortly after it was revealed, according to the book, concluding sarcastically: \u201cThat\u2019s the brain trust they had.\u201d  The Wolff book, parts of which were published by New York magazine, portrayed Trump as shocked that he won the election and said his wife, Melania Trump, was in tears, and \u201cnot of joy.\u201d  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called the book \u201ctrashy tabloid fiction.\u201d  The first lady\u2019s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said: \u201cThe book is clearly going to be sold in the bargain fiction section. Mrs. Trump supported her husband\u2019s decision to run for President and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did.\u201d  Reporting by Steve Holland; Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, Jim Oliphant and Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Will Dunham, Peter Cooney and Paul Tait"
