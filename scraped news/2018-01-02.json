          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia\u2019s transport safety investigation agency said on Tuesday it plans to raise a seaplane that crashed into a Sydney river on New Year\u2019s Eve, killing six people, including the chief executive of British catering giant Compass Group Plc.  Australian Transport Safety Bureau Executive Director Nat Nagy said investigators would probe several lines of inquiry to piece together what happened, including a close look at the plane\u2019s avionics and maintenance record and the pilot\u2019s background and experience.  It was hoped the plane would be raised by the end of the week, Nagy said. A crane, airbags, or a combination of the two, would be used to raise the plane from the riverbed as gently as possible.  The plane is submerged in 13 meters of water near Cowan, about 40 km (25 miles) north of Sydney.  Nagy said investigators would also look for any other electronic devices, including iPads or iPhones, that may have been on board when the plane crashed on Sunday, killing Compass chief executive Richard Cousins, 58, and four members of his family. The pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, was also killed.  A preliminary report into the crash will be made public in about a month, although authorities have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened.  \u201cIf we do identify any critical safety issues throughout the course of the investigation, we will immediately notify the relevant authorities ... to remedy any issues,\u201d Nagy said.  \u201cThis particular aircraft, I understand was manufactured in 1963, it\u2019s not unusual to have aircraft of that sort of age flying around ... we haven\u2019t seen any systemic issues around this aircraft,\u201d he added.  Australian police have identified those killed with Cousins as Emma Bowden, 48, Heather Bowden, 11, Edward Cousins, 23, and William Cousins, 25.  Family members and media reports identified four of the victims Cousins\u2019 two sons, his fianc\u00e9e and her daughter.  Cousins, who led Compass over the past 11 years, was due to step down in March after being widely credited with turning the company\u2019s business around and making it into one of the Financial Times Stock Exchange\u2019s best-performing firms.   The seaplane was part of the Sydney Seaplanes business that has operated since 2005 with no previous record of mishap.  Seaplane flights have been canceled until further notice.

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Kim Jong Un warned the United States on Monday he had a \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk ready for use if North Korea was threatened, but offered an olive branch to South Korea, saying he was \u201copen to dialogue\u201d with Seoul.  After a year dominated by fiery rhetoric and escalating tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program, the North Korean leader used his televised New Year\u2019s Day speech to declare his country \u201ca peace-loving and responsible nuclear power\u201d and call for lower military tensions and improved ties with the South.  \u201cWhen it comes to North-South relations, we should lower the military tensions on the Korean Peninsula to create a peaceful environment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cBoth the North and the South should make efforts.\u201d  Kim said he would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February.  \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to showcase the national pride and we wish the Games will be a success. Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility,\u201d Kim said.  South Korea said it welcomed Kim\u2019s offer. But U.S.-based experts saw Kim\u2019s speech as a clear attempt to divide Seoul from its main ally, Washington, which has led an international campaign to pressure North Korea through sanctions to give up weapons programs aimed at developing nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States.  \u201cWe have always stated our willingness to talk with North Korea anytime and anywhere if that would help restore inter-Korean relations and lead to peace on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d a spokesman for the South Korean presidency said.  Lee Hee-beom, president of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee, said it welcomed North Korean participation and would \u201cdiscuss relevant matters with the South Korean government as well as the International Olympic Committee.\u201d  South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said North Korea\u2019s participation would ensure the safety of the Olympics and proposed last month that Seoul and Washington postpone large military drills that the North denounces as a rehearsal for war until after the Games.  Asked to comment on Kim\u2019s speech, U.S. President Donald Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201d as he walked into a New Year\u2019s Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.  The U.S. State Department did not respond to a requests for comment on Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s address, but analysts said it was an attempt to weaken the U.S.-South Korean alliance.  \u201cThis speech pokes at the fissure that has lain below the surface in U.S.-South Korean relations, and seems designed to drive a wedge there,\u201d said Douglas Paal, a former senior U.S. diplomat who heads the Asia program at Washington\u2019s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.   \u201cPresident Moon needs a successful Olympics and the U.S. drive to increase pressure fits poorly with the Southern agenda.\u201d  Evans Revere, another former senior U.S. diplomat who took part in unofficial talks with North Korean officials last year, said Pyongyang would likely try to extract concessions as a \u201cprice\u201d for Olympics participation.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Seoul falling for this,\u201d he said, adding that Seoul and Washington had so far stayed in synch in the pressure and isolation campaign.  Revere said Kim\u2019s speech contained the strongest defense yet of North Korea\u2019s status as a permanently nuclear-armed country.  \u201cImplicit in Kim Jong Un\u2019s speech is a willingness to engage with others, including the United States, on the basis of their acceptance of the \u2018reality\u2019 of North Korea\u2019s permanent nuclear status. That\u2019s not a basis on which the United States is prepared to engage,\u201d he said.    Moon took office last May pledging to engage Pyongyang in dialogue. But North Korea snubbed his overtures, including an offer to hold inter-Korean military talks about ceasing hostile activities along the border, as it tested missiles at an unprecedented pace.  Kim said that rather than encouraging U.S. measures that \u201cthreaten the security and peace of the Korean peninsula,\u201d Seoul should instead respond to overtures from the North, and \u201cstop nuclear war exercises with foreign forces.\u201d  North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September in defiance of international sanctions, raising fears of a new conflict on the Korean peninsula.  After North Korea tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead to anywhere in the United States, Kim declared his nuclear force complete.  He continued that theme in his New Year\u2019s address, announcing that North Korea would focus in 2018 on \u201cmass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment\u201d.  That, Kim said, was \u201cirreversible with any force\u201d, making it impossible for the United States to start a war against North Korea.  \u201cThe whole territory of the U.S. is within the range of our nuclear strike and a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office and this is just a reality, not a threat,\u201d he said, while emphasizing that the weapons would only be used if North Korea was threatened.  Kim\u2019s customary New Year\u2019s speech is closely watched for indications of the policy direction the unpredictable and reclusive leader is likely to pursue in the coming year.  Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until last April and now at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said there was an argument to be made to encourage North Korea\u2019s Olympic participation but that it should not be taken too far.  \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly legitimate to dial down some of the signaling and the rhetoric ... but not to load up their tray with concessions in advance. We should reward responsible behavior, but not try to bribe North Korea into behaving; that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said.  Nam Sung-wook, a North Korea expert at Korea University in Seoul said Kim was likely to tone down his weapons testing - at least ahead of the Olympics.   \u201cWhat North Korea is most afraid of is being forgotten in the international arena,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout launching missiles and conducting a nuclear test, North Korea will be in the spotlight just by attending the Winter Olympics.\u201d  Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at Washington\u2019s conservative Center for the National Interest, said that if North Korea did participate in the Olympics, there could be a lull in tensions, but only a brief one.  \u201cAs we move into the spring, Pyongyang will once again test all different types of missiles and weapons,\u201d he said.

          "body": "* Moon says better inter-Korean ties linked to nuclear issue  * North offers talks, but steadfast on nuclear programme  * Seoul seeks to allow N.Korean athletes at Winter Olympics (Adds more details on Winter Olympics from S.Korean media reports)  By Christine Kim  SEOUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday the improvement of inter-Korean relations was linked to resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme, a day after the North offered talks with Seoul but was steadfast on its nuclear ambitions.  \u201cThe improvement of relations between North and South Korea cannot go separately with resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme, so the foreign ministry should coordinate closely with allies and the international community regarding this,\u201d Moon said in opening remarks at a cabinet meeting.  Moon\u2019s comments contrasted with those of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who said on Monday that Seoul should stop asking foreign countries for help in improving ties between the two Koreas.  \u201cThis shows the Moon administration is looking at the situation from a very realistic, rational point of view,\u201d said Jeong Yeung-tae, head of the Institute of North Korea Studies in Seoul. \u201cIt also shows resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear issue has a bigger priority (than improving inter-Korean relations).\u201d  Moon\u2019s comments came after a New Year\u2019s Day speech by Kim who said he was \u201copen to dialogue\u201d with Seoul, and for North Korean athletes to possibly take part in the Winter Games, but steadfastly declared North Korea a nuclear power.  The South Korean president requested the ministries of unification and sports to swiftly create measures to help North Korea participate in the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.  Choi Moon-soon, governor of Gangwon Province where the Pyeongchang Olympics is set to be held, has proposed South Korea would send cruise ships to bring North Korean athletes and officials to Pyeongchang, according to South Korean media.  Choi met North Korea\u2019s sports official Mun Woong in China on Dec. 18 on the sidelines of a international youth football tournament where North and South Korea soccer teams competed, the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported.  Choi suggested sending cruise ships to North Korea\u2019s Wonsan port to help the North minimise transportation costs and to use the ships as accommodation in South Korea, said the newspaper.  The governor did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment on Tuesday.  As for talks between the two Koreas, Defence Ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyun-soo said Seoul was awaiting a more detailed reply from Pyongyang to already-existing offers for dialogue made back in July last year by Seoul.  \u201cWe offered military talks in July and our offer still stands. We are waiting North Korea\u2019s reply. We are willing to talk with North Korea on the peaceful resolution of the North\u2019s nuclear programme regardless of form, time and method,\u201d said Choi in a regular briefing.  Kim\u2019s offer of talks and sporting co-operation with South Korea follows a year dominated by fiery rhetoric and escalating tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme.  North Korea tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in November, 2017, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead to anywhere in the United States.  On Monday, Kim said the North would mass produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles in 2018 for operational deployment, warning he had a \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk which he would use if his country was threatened (Reporting by Christine Kim; Additional reporting by Jane Chung; Editing by Michael Perry)"

          "body": "DENVER (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire on sheriff\u2019s deputies at an apartment complex near Denver on Sunday, killing one officer before the suspect was shot and killed, the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.  Four other deputies and two civilians were shot and wounded by the suspect, identified as 37-year-old Matthew Riehl, who had had numerous run-ins with the law, according to Sheriff Tony Spurlock.  It was not immediately clear why the incident had escalated, Spurlock said.   \u201cAll of them were shot very, very quickly and they all went down almost within seconds of each other,\u201d Spurlock told reporters at a news conference, calling it an \u201cambush-type\u201d attack.   President Donald Trump said on Twitter: \u201cMy deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @dcsheriff, and their families.\u201d  The deputies first responded to a \u201cverbal disturbance\u201d at the apartment complex in Highland Ranch, about 16 miles (26 km) south of Denver, at about 3 a.m., the sheriff\u2019s office said in a statement.   Two men were in the apartment, and one of them told the officers that the other was \u201cacting bizarre and may be having a mental breakdown,\u201d the statement said. The officers left the scene after determining no crime had been committed.  About 5:15 a.m., officers returned after a second complaint. After they entered the residence, the suspect opened fire from a bedroom, killing Deputy Zackari Parrish, 29, and wounding three others.   Parrish, who was married with two young children, had joined the force seven months earlier.  \u201cWhen he was shot and went down, the other officers went down right around him and they tried to pull him out, but were unable to because of their injuries,\u201d Spurlock said.   At about 7 a.m., a SWAT team entered the apartment and more shots were exchanged. Riehl was killed and a fourth officer was wounded.  All told, Riehl fired more than 100 rounds before he was shot by police.  The injured officers were identified as Mike Doyle, 28; Taylor Davis, 30; Jeffrey Pelle, 32, and Tom O\u2019Donnell 31. They were taken to hospital and were in stable condition.  Pelle, who had emergency surgery, is the son of Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle, according to an online statement from the family.    The identities of the two injured civilians were not immediately disclosed, but Spurlock said he believed they are residents from other apartments. Their injuries were not life- threatening, he said.   The housing complex in an affluent suburban community near Littleton is described on its website as \u201cone of the friendliest apartments\u201d in the area.

          "title": "Without NHL players, Team USA hockey looks to Europe",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stanley Cup winner Brian Gionta will captain a U.S. men\u2019s Olympic ice hockey team made up of players from European leagues or the North American development ranks at next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.  Gionta, who has played 15 years in the NHL, was named on Monday amongst more than a dozen little-known Americans playing professionally in Europe, along with a hodgepodge of minor leaguers and ex-NHL players for the Feb. 9-25 Olympics.  He is the only player in the squad to have previous Olympic experience, having played for the U.S. at the 2006 Games in Turin and is well aware the team has precious little time together to try and challenge for a medal in Pyeongchang.  \u201cThe biggest challenge is getting the team to gel together as quick as possible,\u201d Gionta, who won a Stanley Cup in 2003 with the New Jersey Devils, told reporters on Monday.  \u201cWe have four practices or so before we come together and start competing in games.\u201d   Next month\u2019s Olympics are the first since 1994 not to include players from the National Hockey League.  The league said last April it would not release players after failing to reach a deal with the International Olympic Committee to cover players\u2019 travel and insurance costs.  The NHL also were unhappy with the prospect of a nearly three-week interruption to the regular season schedule.  USA Hockey named the bulk of their squad during the NHL\u2019s Winter Classic New Year\u2019s Day game between the New York Rangers and Buffalo Sabres.  Most are drawn from leagues around Europe, with a few playing in the U.S. minors and former NHL players like Gionta.  Only four come from the college ranks, ensuring the team does not mark a full return to the pre-NHL era when the last American team to win gold at the Lake Placid Games in 1980 in the \u2018Miracle on Ice\u2019 were predominantly collegiate players.     The 2018 team features many of the players who went to the Deutschland Cup in Germany in October in what amounted to both a trial and their only warm-up games ahead of Pyeongchang.   They lost all of their games against Slovakia, Russia and Germany and were outscored 12-4.  \u201cObviously from a selection process it\u2019s been a real battle for us,\u201d coach Tony Granato said.   \u201cI think we\u2019ve put together an outstanding group of players that will represent us well come February and give us a great chance to ... compete for a medal.\u201d  The team\u2019s first group game is on Feb. 14 against Slovenia before they face Slovakia on Feb. 16. They also face a stiff challenge on Feb. 17 from an unknown collection of Russians, who will play under the Olympic flag.  The IOC has banned Russia from formal participation for doping violations, but Russian athletes deemed to be drug-free can compete independently.  \u201cAny time you play a Russian team you expect high skill and expect to see extremely talented players,\u201d Granato said.   \u201cHow they put it together and what they do in the next few weeks, we\u2019ll have to keep an eye on, but we\u2019re not going to do anything different as we get ready for the Olympics.\u201d  Editing by Greg Stutchbury"

Carroll had 14 points and rookie center Jarrett Allen led the Nets with a career-high 16 points on an off shooting night for both teams.

Brooklyn shot 43.9 percent from the field and was 9 of 25 from 3-point range, including Carroll\u2019s 25-footer with 4:30 left in the fourth quarter.  After Carroll provided a 96-95 lead with 34 seconds left, the Magic (12-26) had two chances to tie in the final seconds, but Allen Crabbe blocked guard Evan Fournier\u2019s long 3-pointer with seven seconds remaining and guard D.J.

Aaron Gordon led the Magic with 20 points and added 12 rebounds, Bismack Biyombo grabbed 17 rebounds to go with 12 points and point guard Elfrid Payton had 17 points and seven assists.  Crabbe finished with 15 points.  Both teams are back in action at home Wednesday night with the Magic hosting the Dallas Mavericks and the Nets entertaining the Minnesota Timberwolves.

          "body": "DeMar DeRozan poured in a career-high 52 points, including eight in overtime, to carry the Raptors to a 131-127 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in Toronto on Monday.  DeRozan, a shooting guard, made 17 of 29 field-goal attempts and all 13 of his free throws. His previous career high was 45 points against the Philadelphia 76ers last month on Dec. 21.  Kyle Lowry had 26 points, six rebounds and six assists for the Raptors (25-10), who have won 14 of their last 17. Fran VanVleet and Serge Ibaka contributed 11 points apiece for Toronto.  Eric Bledsoe\u2019s 29 points led the Bucks (19-16). Giannis Antetokounmpo supplied 26 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, while Khris Middleton added 18 points and Thon Maker chipped in 16.  DeRozan drained a pullup jumper with 2:52 remaining in overtime to give the Raptors a 121-117 lead. He hit two free throws 37 seconds later to reach the 50-point mark. Lowry\u2019s layup with 1:33 left made it 125-120.  Bledsoe\u2019s 3-pointer with 10.6 seconds left brought Milwaukee within three before VanVleet split two free throws. Antetokounmpo\u2019s dunk with seven seconds left made it a two-point game. DeRozan then made two free throws to seal the Raptors\u2019 victory.  DeRozan scored 26 in the first half as the Raptors led 60-56 at the break. Lowry made a 3-pointer with 8:42 remaining in the third to bump the lead to double digits, 71-61.  Antetokounmpo scored six points during a 12-2 Bucks spurt that pulled them within one, 76-75. Maker committed a goaltending violation on a DeRozan layup in the final minute of the quarter, giving the Raptors an 88-84 advantage.  Milwaukee moved in front, 92-90, on a Middleton jumper. The Raptors regained the lead on VanVleet\u2019s 3-pointer and neither team led by more than five the remainder of regulation.  Matthew Dellavedova\u2019s 3-pointer with 3:23 left gave the Bucks a 108-106 edge. Lowry knotted the game at 112-112 on a 3-pointer with 56.9 seconds remaining.  Bledsoe and DeRozan traded free throws and both teams came up empty in their final possessions of regulation, sending the game to overtime.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Seven days after a Christmas Day blowout of the Lakers, the Minnesota Timberwolves doubled down with another beatdown of Los Angeles in a 114-96 rout Monday night in Minneapolis.  Jimmy Butler had a game-high 28 points and nine assists despite seven turnovers, Andrew Wiggins added 21 points and nine boards and Gorgui Dieng scored 17 to pace the Timberwolves\u2019 victory. Minnesota opened the game on a 16-0 run.  Karl-Anthony Towns amassed 16 points and 13 rebounds and Taj Gibson scored 14 to help complete a balanced Timberwolves scoring attack that put up 49.4 percent shooting from the floor (40 of 81).  Minnesota (24-14) followed up a 10-5 month of December with their seventh win in the last eight games.  Jordan Clarkson led the Lakers with 20 points, Julius Randle totaled 15 points and 12 boards and Brandon Ingram chipped in 14 points.  Corey Brewer (12 points) and Josh Hart (10) were the only other double-digit scorers for a Lakers offense that could only manage 44.7 percent shooting (34 of 76).  Los Angeles (11-25) lost its seventh straight and has dropped 10 of 11 dating back to Dec. 12. The Lakers were defeated at home by the Timberwolves 121-104 on Christmas Day and went 3-11 in December.  Ingram\u2019s stepback jumper with 5:05 to play in the third quarter pulled Los Angeles within 78-72, but Gibson\u2019s dunk sparked a 13-4 Minnesota run to close the quarter.  Clarkson\u2019s runner at the 8:08 mark of the fourth got the Lakers back within 11 points at 97-86. Butler knocked down a pair of free throws and hit a turnaround jumper to stake the Timberwolves\u2019 lead at 101-86 and recapture the momentum.  The Timberwolves led 60-48 at halftime after outscoring the Lakers by 12 in the first quarter.  Minnesota heads out for a quick two-game road swing beginning Wednesday in Brooklyn.

          "body": "CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Africa will crown its best soccer player on Thursday but the electors have a tough choice in deciding between the three candidates for the 2017 African Footballer of the Year award.  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Borussia Dortmund and Gabon goes up against Liverpool\u2019s Senegalese Sadio Mane and Egyptian Mohamed Salah with none of the final three candidates having a defining achievement over the last 12 months to set them apart.   The winner will be announced at the annual Confederation of African Football awards being hosted in Accra, Ghana.  Aubameyang, who was the African Footballer of the Year in 2015 and runner-up in the last poll to Riyad Mahrez, finished as top scorer in the Bundesliga last season, netting 31 goals, and continued his form in front of goal into the new campaign.  He also scored the winner in the German Cup final in May but that is hardly likely to resonate with the voters, who are the national team coaches and captains from each African country plus a selected panel of journalists.   At national team level, the 28-year-old Aubameyang made little impression at the African Nations Cup finals in his home country at the start of 2017 and then missed most of Gabon\u2019s unsuccessful World Cup qualifying campaign, citing transfer negotiations among the reasons for his absences.  Mane and Salah helped Senegal and Egypt qualify for the World Cup after lengthy absences and have emerged as leading players this season in the English Premier League.  Salah, 25, has the edge over his club mate since he was a major catalyst in Egypt reaching the Nations Cup final in Libreville in February, where they lost narrowly to Cameroon, and has scored regularly for Liverpool after his record transfer for an African footballer in the close season.  Mane, also 25, is looking to become only the second Senegalese to win the award after El Hadji Diouf, who was African Footballer of the Year in 2001 and 2002.  The only Egyptian winner was Mahmoud Al Khatib in 1983, while French-born Aubameyang is the only player from Gabon to win the award, which was first introduced in 1970.

The national championship game is Jan. 8 in Atlanta.  Michel had 181 yards and three touchdowns rushing and caught four passes for 41 yards and a score as the Bulldogs (13-1) posted the largest comeback in Rose Bowl history in what was also the highest-scoring Rose Bowl.  Rodrigo Blankenship made a 38-yard field goal to give Georgia a 48-45 lead on the first possession of overtime before Austin Seibert forced a second overtime with a 33-yarder.  Lorenzo Carter blocked Seibert\u2019s 27-yard field goal attempt in the second overtime. Georgia lost two yards on a running play before Michel broke through the left side for his fourth score.  \u201cWhat a game, what an atmosphere,\u201d Georgia coach Kirby Smart told ESPN on the field after the game. \u201cMy heart goes out to the Oklahoma team, because these guys played their tails off. And so did ours, nobody ever quit. Everybody fought hard ... so proud of these kids.\u201d  Oklahoma had 531 yards total offense. Georgia had 527.  Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield completed 23 of 35 passes for 287 yards and two touchdowns, and he also caught a touchdown pass. His 2-yard scoring catch with six seconds left in the first half made it 31-14, but Blankenship made a 55-yard field goal as time expired to cut it to 31-17.  Jake Fromm completed 20 of 29 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns for Georgia. Nick Chubb added 145 yards rushing and two scores as he and Michel became the all-time leaders for rushing yards by a duo in FBS history. Michel and Chubb have accounted for 8,284 total rushing yards in their time at Georgia, surpassing SMU\u2019s duo of Eric Dickerson and Craig James (8,193).  Georgia scored the first three touchdowns of the second half and Fromm\u2019s 4-yard scoring pass to Javon Wims gave the Bulldogs their first lead, 38-31, with 13:47 remaining. That drive was set up by Mayfield\u2019s only interception.  \u201cWe kept believing. We knew we were a fourth-quarter team. We were more physical, we were more physical than them and we just kept chopping,\u201d said Fromm. \u201cWe knew each and every blow we took in the first half was going to pay off for us in the second half.\u201d  Mayfield completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to Dimitri Flowers to cap an 88-yard drive and tie the game at 38 with 8:47 remaining. The Sooners had 37 yards in their first five possession of the second half before that drive.  On the next series, Oklahoma cornerback Steven Parker returned a Michel fumble 46 yards for a touchdown to put the Sooners up 45-38 with 6:52 left.

McCollum drained a layup and a pair of free throws in the final minute of overtime to break a tie at 120. Al-Farouq Aminu added 24 points on 9-of-17 shooting for the Trail Blazers, and Jusuf Nurkic contributed a double-double with 11 points and 15 rebounds.  Portland (19-17) won its third consecutive game in Chicago and improved to 11-7 on the road this season.  Kris Dunn led the Bulls with 22 points on 9-of-20 shooting. Lauri Markkanen added 19 points on 7-of-12 shooting, and Nikola Mirotic posted his third double-double in 14 games with 18 points and 10 rebounds.  Chicago (13-24) lost at home for the first time in eight games.  McCollum put Portland on top for good when he attacked the paint and calmly made a 3-foot layup with 56.5 seconds left in overtime. Dunn missed a jump shot on the next possession and Nurkic grabbed the rebound. After another missed jump shot by Dunn with eight seconds left, McCollum sealed the outcome at the free-throw line.  The score was even at 112 at the end of regulation. McCollum hit a driving layup with 57.3 seconds remaining to tie the game and had a chance to win it with a pull-up jump shot from the right elbow, but the ball caromed off the rim to bring on overtime.  The Bulls opened the fourth quarter with an 87-83 lead. A deep 3-pointer by Shabazz Napier in the closing seconds of the third quarter trimmed Portland\u2019s deficit from seven points to four.  The Trail Blazers jumped to a 31-23 lead at the end of the first quarter. The Bulls responded by outscoring Portland 30-21 in the second quarter to grab a 53-52 halftime edge.  Portland played without star point guard Damian Lillard, who missed his fifth game in a row because of a right hamstring strain. The two-time All-Star leads the team with 25.2 points per game.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Record-shattering arctic cold reached as far south as Florida on Monday with freeze warnings in place from Texas to the Atlantic Coast and the Northeastern United States facing another cold wave at the end of the week, forecasters said.  Temperatures ranged from 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit (11 to 17 degrees Celsius) below normal across the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, with only southern Florida untouched by the arctic blast.  \u201cThat degree of cold will be with us until tomorrow,\u201d said Brian Hurley, a National Weather Service meteorologist at College Park, Maryland. \u201cTuesday morning, we\u2019re looking at temperatures with very high probability of record lows.\u201d  Along Alabama\u2019s Gulf Coast, the temperature in the city of Mobile could hit a low of 16 F (minus 9 C) overnight. Stiff breezes were expected to create dangerously cold wind chills across southeastern Georgia and most of northeastern Florida, the weather service said.  Michael Kimberl, co-founder of Sean\u2019s Outpost, an encampment for homeless people in Pensacola, Florida, said he was handing out propane fuel and extra blankets to residents.  \u201cOur community is very unequipped for weather of this type,\u201d he said by phone. Homeless shelters were also making special accommodations, including one site available for women and children, he said.  The mass of frigid air pumped south by a dip in the jet stream sent temperatures plunging across the U.S. heartland. Omaha, Nebraska, posted a low of minus 20 F (minus 29 C), breaking a 130-year-old record, and Aberdeen, South Dakota, shattered a record set in 1919 with a temperature of minus 32 F (minus 36 C).  The cold will be unrelenting across the Middle Atlantic and Northeastern United States, with up to two dozen low-temperature records expected in those regions over the next day or two, Hurley said.  Although the cold should ease across most of the United States after Tuesday, the northeastern quarter of the country will see a repeat of the frigid temperatures from Thursday to Friday as another arctic blast hits the area.  The private AccuWeather forecaster said the cold snap could combine with a storm brewing off the Bahamas to bring snow and high winds to much of the Eastern Seaboard as it heads north on Wednesday and Thursday.  The only part of the United States spared the deep freeze is the Southwest, with above-normal temperatures and dry weather expected to linger there, the weather service said.

          "title": "China December factory growth quickens to four-month high but confidence subdued: Caixin PMI",
          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China\u2019s manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December as factories cranked up production to meet a surge in new orders, a private business survey showed on Tuesday.   The reading suggested surprising resilience in the world\u2019s second-largest economy at the end of the year, though it was somewhat at odds with a much larger official survey on Sunday that pointed to a slight loss of momentum.  The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 last month, from 50.8 in November, and far outpacing economists\u2019 expectations for a slight dip to 50.6.  The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.  Analysts have expected some softening in China\u2019s manufacturing activity as a punishing crackdown on air pollution, a cooling property market and higher borrowing costs all start to weigh on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  That view appeared to be borne out by the official data at the weekend which suggested that production expanded in December at a slightly more modest pace.      But Caixin\u2019s findings showed output grew at the fastest pace in three months, bolstered by improving demand.  Total new orders at home and from abroad rose at the strongest pace since August, with the sub-index jumping to 53.0 in December from 51.8 the previous month.  The Caixin survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms which are believed to be more export-oriented.  While the official data pointed to a wobble in production, it also showed a pickup in overseas orders which should help support China\u2019s exporters in the next few months.  However, despite the increase in new work, the Caixin survey indicated manufacturers continued to shed staff in December and input costs continued to rise sharply, largely due to higher prices for raw materials.  Companies were able to pass on some of those cost increases to customers, suggesting broader inflationary pressures may intensify in China this year. The official data pointed to even stronger price rises.    China\u2019s vast industrial sector has reported strong earnings growth this year thanks to a year-long construction boom that has fueled demand and prices for building materials.  But government measures to tame rising housing prices and high debt levels are starting to weigh on property investment, while the boost from a massive infrastructure spree is starting to fade.   Beijing\u2019s war on winter smog has also disrupted manufacturing activity.  Some steel mills, smelters and factories in the north have been forced to curtail or halt production, though plants in other parts of the country may be ramping up production to fill the shortfall and gain more market share.   Despite the pickups in output and new orders, however, the Caixin survey showed business confidence in the 12-month outlook remained weak by historical standards. Respondents cited forecasts of relatively subdued client demand and changes to national policies, though no more details were provided.         \u201cManufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,\u201d Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.  \u201cHowever, we should not underestimate downward pressure on growth due to tightening monetary policy and strengthening oversight on local government financing.\u201d  Analysts have widely expected China will report slightly cooler economic growth in the fourth quarter after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion in the first nine months of the year, supported by the construction boom and robust exports.   Sources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilizing build-up of debt.

          "title": "Shunned and homeless LGBT Ukrainians find shelter in Kiev",
          "body": "KIEV (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Staring at the Berlin Wall mural of Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev kissing East German leader Erich Honecker on the mouth,  Yevhenii Kalashnyk knew it was time to come out as gay.  The 20-year-old Ukrainian kissed a friend in front of the graffiti painting in September and posted the photo on Instagram. The decision changed his life.       \u201cI was emotionally full,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview.  He said he had only kissed another man for the first time a few months earlier and had arrived in the German capital about 60-days into his first trip to western Europe where he hoped to find some peace of mind after a difficult period.  For while gay sex has been legal in Ukraine since 1991, it remains socially taboo with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people facing stigma, discrimination and sometimes violent attacks, rights groups say.  Ukrainian authorities have increased their support for gay rights since a pro-Western government took power following the Maidan protests in 2014 and in 2015 passed a law banning workplace discrimination against the LGBT community.  But critics say homophobic attitudes remain widespread. The country scored 19 out of 100 points in a 2016 survey by EU-funded Rainbow Europe ranking LGBT people\u2019s rights in Europe.   Shortly after posting the kiss photo, Kalashnyk received a call from his mother.   \u201cShe asked: \u2018Are you gay?\u2019. I said \u2018yes\u2019 ... Then she started saying very bad things,\u201d he said, adding that his father also threatened him.  Too afraid to go home to Nikopol, Kalashnyk headed to Kiev when he returned to Ukraine about a month later where he found accommodation with Insight, a local gay rights group.  The organization runs Ukraine\u2019s first and only LGBT shelter - a four-room flat, with bunk beds, a kitchen and communal area, in an old apartment block outside Kiev\u2019s city center.  Up to eight guests at a time can receive food, clothing, medicines, a travel card, as well as legal and psychological help, and can stay up to three months, extendable on an ad hoc basis, Insight says.  \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for people to adapt and start a new life. You don\u2019t have to worry about finding work without knowing where to sleep,\u201d said Pavel, a 48-year-old resident from Donetsk, who declined to give his real name.   The facility was launched in June 2014 to help LGBT people fleeing the conflict in the country\u2019s east but has since opened its doors to those from other regions.   More than 10,000 people have been killed and 1.6 million forced from their homes since pro-Russian separatists in the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk rebelled against Kiev\u2019s pro-western government in 2014.  Members of the LGBT community were also affected by the violence with many losing their jobs, having their houses damaged or suffered homophobic attacks amid the upheaval, said Olga Olshanskaya, the Insight shelter coordinator.  She said transgender people were particularly vulnerable to abuse as they had to show ID documents that did not reflect their appearance or sex at checkpoints in conflict-hit areas.  \u201cNo one wants to leave their home, but (for many) coming to Kiev was the only hope,\u201d said Olshanskaya in a room adorned by rainbow flags at Insight\u2019s headquarters in central Kiev.   Oksana, a 35-year-old transgender woman from Donetsk, said a militiaman manning a checkpoint pointed a gun at her head because of her looks weeks before she left for Kiev in 2014.   She had started undergoing hormone treatment two years earlier after another weapon - a hunting rifle she held against her head - misfired in a failed suicide attempt. Until then she had kept her sexuality quiet, fearing the wrath of her family.  \u201cI was born with all the right organs, two legs, two feet but ... not in the right body,\u201d she said. \u201cTo live life as some else is very difficult\u201d.  Oksana, who preferred not to use her full name, spent just over a month at the Insight shelter in Kiev, long enough to find work at a law firm, and has since founded an advocacy group for transgender rights called T-ema.   But life in Kiev can also be difficult.    Kalashnyk said he sometimes suffers verbal abuse and always carries pepper spray to fight off potential assailants.  In 2015 several dozen protesters attacked a gay pride march, throwing flares and clashing with police.   In June this year, the same event went ahead largely without incident under heavy security following threats from ultra-nationalist groups supporting what they say are traditional Ukrainian values.     Pavel, who works in the pharmaceutical sector, decided against attending the rally in case colleagues recognized him.  \u201cIt could have been the end of my career,\u201d he said.  Some supporters of LGBT rights see progress in Ukraine as symptomatic of the country\u2019s closer integration with the European Union and rejecting its ties with neighboring Russia.  But change is happening too slowly for Kalashnyk.  \u201cI don\u2019t see how I can realize myself here. I don\u2019t see my future in Ukraine,\u201d he said.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A 2.3 percent tax on the sale of medical devices went back into effect on Monday after a two-year suspension, despite opposition by U.S. lawmakers and the medical manufacturing industry.   The excise tax on catheters, pacemakers and other healthcare products was among several fees and taxes imposed in January 2013 to help fund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. It was projected to raise roughly $30 billion over a decade.  After drawing harsh criticism from both political parties as well as medical industry lobbying groups, the U.S. Congress approved a suspension of the levy in 2015.

The excise tax on catheters, pacemakers and other healthcare products was among several fees and taxes imposed in January 2013 to help fund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. It was projected to raise roughly $30 billion over a decade.

          "body": "SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A family of five from the New York City suburb of Scarsdale was aboard a plane that crashed and exploded minutes after takeoff from a popular beach resort in Costa Rica on Sunday, killing all 12 people aboard, a relative and the family\u2019s rabbi said.  Ten U.S. citizens and two Costa Rican pilots were killed when the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft crashed into a mountainous area off the beach town of Punta Islita, the Costa Rican government said. The town is in the province of Guanacaste, about 230 km (140 miles) west of the capital of San Jose.  Forensic workers recovered badly burned bodies from the crash site on Sunday and took the remains to San Jose on Monday, where family members and friends of the Costa Rican pilots gathered outside the morgue.  Autopsies were to begin on Tuesday, a local police official told reporters. He would not specify when bodies would be returned to relatives.   \u201cDue to the state they are in, a little more time is required to identify them. We have to wait,\u201d the country\u2019s security minister, Gustavo Mata, told Reuters Monday in a brief telephone interview.   The dead included the Steinberg family, consisting of a couple and their three sons.  \u201cWe are in utter shock and disbelief right now,\u201d Tamara Steinberg Jacobsen, sister of the father, Bruce Steinberg, said on Facebook, where she posted pictures of the family and thanked people for their condolences.  She also asked for privacy.  Rabbi Jonathan Blake of the Westchester Reform Temple identified the family as Bruce and Irene Steinberg and their sons William, Zachary and Matthew.  \u201cThis tragedy hits our community very hard,\u201d Blake said on Facebook, saying the family had belonged to the temple since 2001 and were active in philanthropic organizations.  Nature Air, the Costa Rican company that operated the flight, identified the five Steinbergs and five other passengers: Thibault Astruc, Amanda Geissler, Charles Palmer, Leslie Weiss and Sherry Wuu.   All 10 passengers were U.S. citizens, the State Department confirmed on Monday.  They died along with Costa Rican pilots Juan Manuel Retana and Emma Ramos, Nature Air said.  Costa Rican civil aviation authorities noted Sunday there were strong winds in the area but said officials had not yet determined the cause of the crash. The flight was part of a special charter of two planes. The other took off 20 minutes earlier and arrived safely in San Jose.  Punta Islita, on Costa Rica\u2019s Pacific Coast, is popular among North American and European tourists for its pristine beaches and lush landscape.

          "body": "* Brent, WTI crude begin year above $60, 1st time since 2014  * Ongoing OPEC supply cuts have lifted crude prices  * Strong demand also supports, despite rising U.S. output  * U.S. production capacity has reached 10 mln bpd - Rystad  By Henning Gloystein  SINGAPORE, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices had their highest January opening since 2014 on Tuesday, supported by ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia as well as strong demand.  Only rising U.S. production, which is on the verge of breaking through 10 million barrels per day (bpd), is somewhat hampering the outlook into 2018.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $60.29 a barrel at 0119 GMT, down 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement of 2017, but starting the year above $60 a barrel for the first time since 2014.  Brent crude futures - the international benchmark for oil prices - were at $66.79 a barrel, down 8 cents, or 0.1 percent, since their last close of 2017. It is also the first time since 2014 that Brent opened a year above $60 a barrel.  Traders said Tuesday\u2019s prices dips were due to the full return of the 450,000 bpd capacity Forties pipeline system in the North Sea, as well as ongoing repairs at a Libyan pipeline, which had cut output there by 70,000 bpd to 100,000 bpd.  Global oil markets have been supported by a year of production cuts led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. The cuts started in January 2017 and are scheduled to cover all of 2018.  Strong demand growth, especially from China, has also been supporting crude.  \u201cOil inventories have been declining since March 2017 and OPEC have agreed to extend production cuts until the end of 2018 so it is probably uncontroversial to say that the fundamental outlook for oil has improved since the beginning of 2017,\u201d said William O\u2019Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia\u2019s Rivkin Securities.  \u201cOn the other hand, the higher prices are expected to stoke U.S. shale output,\u201d he said.  U.S. commercial crude oil inventories have fallen by almost 20 percent from their historic highs last March, to 431.9 million barrels.  U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has risen by almost 16 percent since mid-2016, to 9.75 million bpd at the end of last year.  However, consultancy Rystad Energy said \u201cU.S. crude oil production capacity has reached 10 million barrels per day.\u201d  Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin"

          "body": "Jan 2 (Reuters) - Australian shares were little changed on their first day of trade in 2018 on Tuesday, struggling for cues as major financial markets worldwide remained shut for the New Year\u2019s holiday.  The S&P/ASX 200 index was marginally higher at 0028 GMT. The benchmark fell 0.4 percent on the last trading day of 2017, but logged a 7 percent gain for the year.  \u201cWe had anticipated the market to be down a bit more than where we are...there\u2019s a bit of buying coming back in, but the volumes are non-existent,\u201d said Chris Weston, institutional dealer at IG Markets.  \u201cEveryone\u2019s looking ahead and trying to find out what the trends are going to be... the immediate catalysts are probably going to come from European and U.S. data.\u201d  Material stocks accounted for most the gains on the index, with iron ore miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto edging up 0.4 percent each.  Rio touched its highest since Aug. 2011, and was set for its 10th straight session of gains, while BHP headed for its sixth session on top.  \u201cIf you look at the last three months or so, materials and energy stocks were the place to be, and it looks like that\u2019s spilling over into the new year,\u201d said Weston.  Chinese iron ore futures jumped nearly 3 percent on Friday as investors bet steel mills in the world\u2019s top buyer of the ore will restock the raw material ahead of an expected end in March to steel production curbs imposed to cut pollution.  Gold miners also enjoyed modest gains as the metal touched a three-month high on Friday thanks to a weak dollar, political tensions and receding concerns over the impact of U.S. interest rate hikes.  Newcrest Mining was among the best performers on the index, climbing as much as 1.5 percent.  Shares of Brambles rose 1.8 percent in their biggest single-day spike in almost six weeks after the pallets and container company said it estimates a $125 million to $155 million one-time benefit due to the passing of new U.S. tax laws.  New Zealand is closed for a public holiday, with the financial market reopening for trade on Wednesday. The NZ benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index gained 22 percent in 2017 and extended its annual winning streak to a sixth consecutive year.  Reporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru; Editing by Sam Holmes"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stanley Cup winner Brian Gionta will captain a U.S. men\u2019s Olympic ice hockey team made up of players from European leagues or the North American development ranks at next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.  Gionta, who has played 15 years in the NHL, was named on Monday amongst more than a dozen little-known Americans playing professionally in Europe, along with a hodgepodge of minor leaguers and ex-NHL players for the Feb. 9-25 Olympics.  He is the only player in the squad to have previous Olympic experience, having played for the U.S. at the 2006 Games in Turin and is well aware the team has precious little time together to try and challenge for a medal in Pyeongchang.  \u201cThe biggest challenge is getting the team to gel together as quick as possible,\u201d Gionta, who won a Stanley Cup in 2003 with the New Jersey Devils, told reporters on Monday.  \u201cWe have four practices or so before we come together and start competing in games.\u201d   Next month\u2019s Olympics are the first since 1994 not to include players from the National Hockey League.  The league said last April it would not release players after failing to reach a deal with the International Olympic Committee to cover players\u2019 travel and insurance costs.  The NHL also were unhappy with the prospect of a nearly three-week interruption to the regular season schedule.  USA Hockey named the bulk of their squad during the NHL\u2019s Winter Classic New Year\u2019s Day game between the New York Rangers and Buffalo Sabres.  Most are drawn from leagues around Europe, with a few playing in the U.S. minors and former NHL players like Gionta.  Only four come from the college ranks, ensuring the team does not mark a full return to the pre-NHL era when the last American team to win gold at the Lake Placid Games in 1980 in the \u2018Miracle on Ice\u2019 were predominantly collegiate players.     The 2018 team features many of the players who went to the Deutschland Cup in Germany in October in what amounted to both a trial and their only warm-up games ahead of Pyeongchang.   They lost all of their games against Slovakia, Russia and Germany and were outscored 12-4.  \u201cObviously from a selection process it\u2019s been a real battle for us,\u201d coach Tony Granato said.   \u201cI think we\u2019ve put together an outstanding group of players that will represent us well come February and give us a great chance to ... compete for a medal.\u201d  The team\u2019s first group game is on Feb. 14 against Slovenia before they face Slovakia on Feb. 16. They also face a stiff challenge on Feb. 17 from an unknown collection of Russians, who will play under the Olympic flag.  The IOC has banned Russia from formal participation for doping violations, but Russian athletes deemed to be drug-free can compete independently.  \u201cAny time you play a Russian team you expect high skill and expect to see extremely talented players,\u201d Granato said.   \u201cHow they put it together and what they do in the next few weeks, we\u2019ll have to keep an eye on, but we\u2019re not going to do anything different as we get ready for the Olympics.\u201d  Editing by Greg Stutchbury"

          "title": "Chicago homicides fall 16 percent in 2017",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Homicides in Chicago fell 16 percent in 2017 while shootings were down and firearms arrests were up, police said on Monday, marking a reduction in bloodshed that made the city a symbol of U.S. gun violence and an object of criticism for President Donald Trump.  Police reported 650 homicides in an annual report on crime statistics, down from 771 in 2016. Shooting incidents fell 22 percent and the number of shooting victims fell by 892 people, a 21 percent drop. Meanwhile, gun arrests increased 27 percent and police reported seizing more than 8,600 illegal weapons.  Police attributed the drop to putting more officers on the streets, investing in new technology and a smarter policing strategy.  The city was also coming off a high baseline after the number of homicides in 2016, which represented a nearly 60 percent spike from the previous year.  The United States\u2019 third largest city still ranks No. 1 in murders, with more than the two largest cities combined. New York and Los Angles each had fewer than 300 homicides in 2017.  Overall crime for other offenses - including sexual assault, robbery, aggravated battery, burglary and vehicle theft - was down 2 percent, police said.  \u201cI am proud of the progress our officers made in reducing gun violence all across the city in 2017, but none of us are satisfied,\u201d Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in the report. \u201cIn 2018, we are going to work to build on the progress we made last year - to reduce gun violence, to save lives and to find justice for victims.\u201d  Chicago initiated police reforms in 2017 after a federal investigation found officers routinely violated people\u2019s civil rights, citing excessive force and racially discriminatory conduct.  The city hired more than 1,100 new police officers in 2017, and the department issued a new policy on use of force.  Crime fell by 43 percent in Englewood district and 26 percent in Harrison, the first two districts to employ so-called Strategic Decision Support Centers, police said.  The centers use predictive crime software to enable a more efficient deployment of officers, install more cameras, set up gunshot detection systems and send real-time notifications and intelligence data to officers on their smartphones, the department said.  The deployment of more than 7,000 body cameras was the largest of its kind in the United States, the report said.  Trump made Chicago crime a theme of his 2016 campaign and kept criticizing the city in 2017 even as crime fell.  \u201cCrime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help. 1714 shootings in Chicago this year!\u201d the Republican president wrote on Twitter in June.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Trump\u2019s tweet referred  to sending more federal agents to Chicago and plans to prosecute firearms cases aggressively.  A spokesman for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat, thanked the U.S. government for 20 additional agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives but said the progress was made before those agents had arrived.

          "title": "Darts: No fairytale finish for Taylor as Cross wins world title",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The great Phil Taylor bowed out of professional darts after the 16-time champion lost 7-2 to debutant Rob Cross in the final of the PDC World Championship at Alexandra Palace in London on Monday.  The 27-year-old Cross, who turned professional at the start of last year, was soon three sets ahead of fellow Englishman Taylor, who is 30 years older and won his last title in 2013.  Taylor who battled to stay in the contest, won 10 legs and had 12 180s, one more than Cross, but could not stop the sparkling former electrician who triumphed with a 140 finish.  Cross is the first man to win the tournament on his debut since Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld in 2007. Taylor won his first final on debut 28 years ago by beating Eric Bristow.  Taylor jokingly lifted the trophy and said of his career: \u201cIt\u2019s been marvellous. I\u2019ve had a fantastic career, (with) the youngsters coming through I just can\u2019t do it anymore.  \u201cI tried my best but he was like me 25 years ago, he was relentless and didn\u2019t stop putting me under pressure.  \u201cIt was like an old man against a young man. It was a mis-match. That\u2019s it for me because I haven\u2019t got the energy or interest to beat Michael van Gerwen or him (Cross).\u201d  Cross had already beaten Dutch defending champion Van Gerwen 6-5 in one of the most thrilling semi-finals in years.  Taylor, nicknamed \u2018The Power\u2019, said before the tournament that it would be his last professional event before retirement. It was his 13th defeat in his 29 world championships.  Taylor was playing in his 21st final and Cross joins Dennis Priestley, John Part, Van Barneveld and Gary Anderson as the only men to defeat \u2018The Power\u2019 in a World Championship final.  \u201cI feel great but I\u2019ve got to say it\u2019s Phil\u2019s last year, I\u2019ve won my first world trophy but it\u2019s about him departing and that\u2019s why I let him lift the trophy with me,\u201d said Cross.  \u201cIt was my dream 15 years ago to play this guy and now I\u2019ve played him, it\u2019s absolutely phenomenal. I was actually born in 1990 when he won his first title.  \u201cWatching him with his dominance over the years he has been excellent and you won\u2019t see another sportsman like him, you definitely won\u2019t.\u201d  Writing by Ken Ferris; Editing by Andrew Both"

          "title": "North Korea's Kim 'open to dialogue' with South Korea, will only use nukes if threatened",
          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Kim Jong Un warned the United States on Monday he had a \u201cnuclear button\u201d on his desk ready for use if North Korea was threatened, but offered an olive branch to South Korea, saying he was \u201copen to dialogue\u201d with Seoul.  After a year dominated by fiery rhetoric and escalating tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program, the North Korean leader used his televised New Year\u2019s Day speech to declare his country \u201ca peace-loving and responsible nuclear power\u201d and call for lower military tensions and improved ties with the South.  \u201cWhen it comes to North-South relations, we should lower the military tensions on the Korean Peninsula to create a peaceful environment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cBoth the North and the South should make efforts.\u201d  Kim said he would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in February.  \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to showcase the national pride and we wish the Games will be a success. Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility,\u201d Kim said.  South Korea said it welcomed Kim\u2019s offer. But U.S.-based experts saw Kim\u2019s speech as a clear attempt to divide Seoul from its main ally, Washington, which has led an international campaign to pressure North Korea through sanctions to give up weapons programs aimed at developing nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States.  \u201cWe have always stated our willingness to talk with North Korea anytime and anywhere if that would help restore inter-Korean relations and lead to peace on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d a spokesman for the South Korean presidency said.  Lee Hee-beom, president of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee, said it welcomed North Korean participation and would \u201cdiscuss relevant matters with the South Korean government as well as the International Olympic Committee.\u201d  South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said North Korea\u2019s participation would ensure the safety of the Olympics and proposed last month that Seoul and Washington postpone large military drills that the North denounces as a rehearsal for war until after the Games.  Asked to comment on Kim\u2019s speech, U.S. President Donald Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201d as he walked into a New Year\u2019s Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.  The U.S. State Department did not respond to a requests for comment on Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s address, but analysts said it was an attempt to weaken the U.S.-South Korean alliance.  \u201cThis speech pokes at the fissure that has lain below the surface in U.S.-South Korean relations, and seems designed to drive a wedge there,\u201d said Douglas Paal, a former senior U.S. diplomat who heads the Asia program at Washington\u2019s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.   \u201cPresident Moon needs a successful Olympics and the U.S. drive to increase pressure fits poorly with the Southern agenda.\u201d  Evans Revere, another former senior U.S. diplomat who took part in unofficial talks with North Korean officials last year, said Pyongyang would likely try to extract concessions as a \u201cprice\u201d for Olympics participation.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Seoul falling for this,\u201d he said, adding that Seoul and Washington had so far stayed in synch in the pressure and isolation campaign.  Revere said Kim\u2019s speech contained the strongest defense yet of North Korea\u2019s status as a permanently nuclear-armed country.  \u201cImplicit in Kim Jong Un\u2019s speech is a willingness to engage with others, including the United States, on the basis of their acceptance of the \u2018reality\u2019 of North Korea\u2019s permanent nuclear status. That\u2019s not a basis on which the United States is prepared to engage,\u201d he said.    Moon took office last May pledging to engage Pyongyang in dialogue. But North Korea snubbed his overtures, including an offer to hold inter-Korean military talks about ceasing hostile activities along the border, as it tested missiles at an unprecedented pace.  Kim said that rather than encouraging U.S. measures that \u201cthreaten the security and peace of the Korean peninsula,\u201d Seoul should instead respond to overtures from the North, and \u201cstop nuclear war exercises with foreign forces.\u201d  North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September in defiance of international sanctions, raising fears of a new conflict on the Korean peninsula.  After North Korea tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead to anywhere in the United States, Kim declared his nuclear force complete.  He continued that theme in his New Year\u2019s address, announcing that North Korea would focus in 2018 on \u201cmass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment\u201d.  That, Kim said, was \u201cirreversible with any force\u201d, making it impossible for the United States to start a war against North Korea.  \u201cThe whole territory of the U.S. is within the range of our nuclear strike and a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office and this is just a reality, not a threat,\u201d he said, while emphasizing that the weapons would only be used if North Korea was threatened.  Kim\u2019s customary New Year\u2019s speech is closely watched for indications of the policy direction the unpredictable and reclusive leader is likely to pursue in the coming year.  Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until last April and now at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said there was an argument to be made to encourage North Korea\u2019s Olympic participation but that it should not be taken too far.  \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly legitimate to dial down some of the signaling and the rhetoric ... but not to load up their tray with concessions in advance. We should reward responsible behavior, but not try to bribe North Korea into behaving; that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said.  Nam Sung-wook, a North Korea expert at Korea University in Seoul said Kim was likely to tone down his weapons testing - at least ahead of the Olympics.   \u201cWhat North Korea is most afraid of is being forgotten in the international arena,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout launching missiles and conducting a nuclear test, North Korea will be in the spotlight just by attending the Winter Olympics.\u201d  Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at Washington\u2019s conservative Center for the National Interest, said that if North Korea did participate in the Olympics, there could be a lull in tensions, but only a brief one.  \u201cAs we move into the spring, Pyongyang will once again test all different types of missiles and weapons,\u201d he said.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Home prices across Australia\u2019s major cities fell in December as the once red-hot Sydney market continued to cool in the face of tighter rules on investment lending, a relief to regulators but a potential drag on consumer spending power.  Property consultant CoreLogic said its index of home prices for the combined capital cities dipped 0.4 percent in December from November.  Annual growth in prices slowed to 4.3 percent, from 5.2 percent in November and 10.5 percent in the middle of 2017.  Prices in Sydney slipped 0.9 percent in December and pulled annual growth down to just 3.1 percent, a far cry from the peak of 17 percent seen early in the year. Sydney dwelling values are still up 71 percent on the cyclical low hit in February 2012.  Melbourne fared somewhat better, thanks in part to rapid population growth, with prices easing 0.2 percent in December to be 8.9 percent higher for the year.  Home prices outside the major cities edged up 0.2 percent in December to be 3.8 percent higher on the year.  A slowdown has been much desired by the country\u2019s bank watchdog which tightened standards on investment and interest-only loans, leading banks to raise rates on some mortgage products.  The Reserve Bank of Australia has also been concerned that debt-fuelled speculation in property could ultimately hurt both consumers and banks.  The inexorable rise of prices in the major cities had put homes out of the reach of many first-time buyers and had become a political hot potato.  Yet the boom has also been a boon for household wealth with the government statistician estimating the housing stock was worth a cool A$6.8 trillion ($5.3 trillion) at the end of the third quarter - four times the size of annual gross domestic product.

          "body": "(Repeats story from Friday with no changes to text)  * Chongqing to launch trade of pipeline gas, LNG in H1 2018  * Chongqing exchange rivals Shanghai hub, Japan Korean Marker  * Govt price regulation, lack of infrastructures are barriers  By Chen Aizhu and Henning Gloystein  CHONGQING, China/SINGAPORE, Dec 29 (Reuters) - China plans to launch a natural gas exchange in Chongqing in early 2018, aiming to create an Asian price benchmark as the nation\u2019s use of the fuel surges amid its shift away from coal.  China is the world\u2019s third-biggest consumer of natural gas behind the United States and Russia. An exchange in its fast-growing market would be a strong contender for an Asian gas marker off which other supplies in the region could be priced.  The Chongqing Oil and Gas Exchange - supported by state energy majors, and private and local government-backed gas distributors - would provide a trading platform for domestic output, pipeline imports from Central Asia and Myanmar, and imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).  Chongqing is China\u2019s second attempt to develop a traded gas market, having set up a similar exchange in 2015 in Shanghai.  An Asian gas price benchmark to stand next to those of the United States and Europe is seen as a key missing piece in establishing a truly global market for natural gas.  \u201cThe exchange is a product of the government\u2019s reform push - to hand the pricing power to the market,\u201d Exchange Chairman Zhang Bowen told Reuters.  \u201cThe long-term goal is to build the exchange into a benchmark for Asia and to win China its deserved pricing power,\u201d said Zhang, who was previously president of PetroChina Kunlun Energy.  The exchange, led by a board of nine directors including a former PetroChina executive and an ex-senior state planning official, expects to launch electronically-based spot trading of pipeline gas and LNG imports in the first half of next year.  Registered in Chongqing municipality in July with 1 billion yuan ($150 million) in capital, the exchange has a team of 30, including former market developers at state-owned energy giants CNOOC and Sinopec.  \u201cA China gas hub certainly looks attractive from a supply/demand and infrastructure perspective,\u201d said Jeff Brown, president of consultancy Facts Global Energy (FGE).  Chongqing exchange is appraising around 200 potential members, mostly from the consuming hub of eastern China, and will be open to foreign participation in the longer run, said exchange executives.  Still, there are several challenges to overcome, for Chongqing or any other exchanges hoping to establish an active gas trading platform.  \u201cThe biggest would be that the government is still heavily involved in \u2018guiding\u2019 prices. Access to pipelines and import terminals can also be difficult,\u201d said Brown.  China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) currently sets wholesale or city-gate gas prices by linking them to alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and fuel oil.  Investors fear China could be as heavy-handed with gas as it has been with coal. Authorities have repeatedly intervened whenever coal prices have risen sharply, contributing to the virtual death of coal futures in Asia.  China is also struggling to build the infrastructure needed to freely distribute gas supplies. An inadequate pipeline grid and insufficient storage helped to trigger a supply crunch this winter after millions of households were switched from using coal to gas for heating.  \u201cPipelines need to be more connected and greater access allowed for third parties to the grid and terminals. More investments are needed to boost gas storage,\u201d Song Dacai, chairman of the Chongqing exchange\u2019s supervision committee and formerly a pricing official with the NDRC.  The exchange, though, is confident rising demand and slowly expanding gas infrastructure will help it succeed.  Chongqing, with its population of more than 30 million and proximity to Sichuan province\u2019s large gas basin, already has a relatively well-developed gas grid, and distributors there are keen to participate on the exchange.  \u201cAs an investor, we are keen to become a market maker, provided that suppliers are ready to post meaningful volumes for us to trade,\u201d said Luo Jing, deputy head of gas development at China Gas Holdings, a piped gas distributor.  State majors are expected to nominate available volumes on the exchange annually or bi-annually, said Zhang, the exchange chairman.  Others that are trying to develop regional gas exchanges as the basis for an Asian benchmark include Shanghai Petroleum and Gas Exchange and the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) by S&P Global Platts.  The Shanghai exchange, launched in 2015, has so far failed to attract much trading interest. China\u2019s financial hub, though, is seen as a potential oil and gas trading centre and likely home of China\u2019s long delayed crude oil derivatives contract.  In many way, the JKM, an LNG price assessment, is seen as the strongest contender to become a regional gas benchmark.  \u201cJKM seems to be gaining steam as an Asian gas price ... Since LNG is the most commoditised gas in Asia, it seems best placed to emerge as the Asia price marker,\u201d FGE\u2019s Brown said.

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian protesters attacked police stations late into the night on Monday, news agency and social media reports said, as security forces struggled to contain the boldest challenge to the clerical leadership since unrest in 2009.  Videos on social media showed an intense clash in the central town of Qahderijan between security forces and protesters who were trying to occupy a police station, which was partially set ablaze. There were unconfirmed reports of several casualties among demonstrators.  In the western city of Kermanshah, protesters set fire to a traffic police post, but no one was hurt in the incident, Mehr news agency said.  Demonstrations continued for a fifth day. Some 13 people were reported killed on Sunday in the worst wave of unrest since crowds took to the streets in 2009 to condemn the re-election of then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  The protests have put pressure on the clerical leaders in power since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. President Hassan Rouhani made a televised call for calm on Sunday, saying Iranians had the right to criticize but must not cause unrest.  In the central city of Najafabad, a demonstrator opened fire on police with a hunting rifle, killing one and wounding three others, state television said.    Earlier, state TV said armed demonstrators on Sunday had tried to seize police and military bases but were stopped by \u201cstrong resistance from security forces.\u201d It gave no further details and there was no independent confirmation.  State TV had reported that 10 people were killed in protests on Sunday. On Monday, that death toll rose when the deputy governor of the western Hamadan Province, Saeed Shahrokhi, told ISNA news agency that another three protesters were killed on Sunday in the city of Tuyserkan.  Hundreds have been arrested, according to officials and social media. Online video showed police in the capital Tehran firing water cannon to disperse demonstrators, in footage said to have been filmed on Sunday.       Protests against economic hardships and alleged corruption erupted in Iran\u2019s second city of Mashhad on Thursday and escalated across the country into calls for the religious establishment to step down.     Some of the anger was directed at Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, breaking a taboo surrounding the man who has been supreme leader of Iran since 1989.  Video posted on social media showed crowds of people walking through the streets, some chanting \u201cDeath to the dictator!\u201d Reuters was not immediately able to verify the footage. The Fars news agency reported \u201cscattered groups\u201d of protesters in Tehran on Monday and said a ringleader had been arrested.   \u201cThe government will show no tolerance for those who damage public property, violate public order and create unrest in society,\u201d Rouhani said in his address on Sunday.   Unsigned statements on social media urged Iranians to continue to demonstrate in 50 towns and cities.  The government said it was temporarily restricting access to the Telegram messaging app and Instagram. There were reports that internet mobile access was blocked in some areas.         Iran is a major OPEC oil producer and regional power deeply involved in Syria and Iraq as part of a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia. Many Iranians resent those foreign interventions, and want their leaders to create jobs at home, where youth unemployment reached 28.8 percent last year.  Among reported fatalities, two people were shot dead in the southwestern town of Izeh on Sunday and several others were injured, ILNA news agency quoted a member of parliament as saying.   \u201cI do not know whether yesterday\u2019s shooting was done by rally participants or the police and this issue is being investigated,\u201d Hedayatollah Khademi was quoted as saying.  Regional governor Mostafa Samali told Fars that only one person was killed in an incident unrelated to the protests, and the suspected shooter had been arrested.  Almost nine years since the \u201cGreen movement\u201d reformist protests were crushed by the state, Iran\u2019s adversaries voiced their support for the resurgence of anti-government sentiment.   U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cThe great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!\u201d   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the \u201cbrave Iranians\u201d taking to streets to protest a regime that \u201cwastes tens of billions of dollars spreading hate\u201d.   \u201cI wish the Iranian people success in their noble quest for freedom,\u201d he said in a video posted on his Facebook page.

          "body": "(Reuters) - The Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions rang in the New Year by firing their head coaches, while Arizona Cardinals\u2019 Bruce Arians ended a stellar career when he announced his retirement on Monday after five years at the helm.  However, on what traditionally has become known as \u2018Black Monday\u2019, the carnage was relatively light in the National Football League.  John Fox was sent packing following three seasons at the Bears, while Detroit sacked Jim Caldwell after four campaigns, bringing to six the number of teams publicly searching for a new head coach.  The New York Giants ditched head coach Ben McAdoo four weeks ago and on Sunday the Indianapolis Colts dumped head coach Chuck Pagano after six seasons and the Oakland Raiders dispensed with Jack Del Rio following three campaigns.  Del Rio\u2019s departure was perhaps the only surprise, with the others widely expected.  But it was not one-way traffic to the exit door on Monday, with Hue Jackson retaining his position at the Cleveland Browns despite presiding over a winless season.  An emotional Arians announced his retirement after compiling a 49-30-1 record at Arizona.  \u201cThe tears you see are really tears of joy, peace,\u201d said the 65-year-old, who has suffered some health problems recently, including a kidney cancer scare.  \u201cI\u2019ll miss the players. I\u2019ll miss coming out of the locker room, hearing the national anthem because it still gets me.\u201d  Before becoming a head coach, Arians built a strong resume as an assistant coach, including two Super Bowl rings during his time with the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he helped develop Ben Roethlisberger into a champion quarterback.  Fox, meanwhile, departs Chicago after a 5-11 season, and a 14-34 overall record.  \u201cToday is the tough part of our results-oriented business but I wish the Bears organization the best for years to come,\u201d he said in a statement released by the team.  Fox previously spent four seasons in Denver, guiding the team to a losing Super Bowl appearance in the 2013 season.  Caldwell leaves Detroit after compiling a 36-28 record, the first head coach at the franchise to compile a winning record since the early 1970s.

Milton threw touchdown passes to Dredrick Snelson and Otis Anderson in the second half, and Chequan Burkett returned an interception 45 yards for a score midway through the fourth quarter.  UCF finishes the season 13-0, the only undefeated team in the FBS, just two years after going winless in 2015.  Frost accepted the head coaching job at Nebraska in December, but hung around to coach the Knights in the bowl game.  \u201cThis team had nowhere to go but up,\u201d Frost said in a post-game interview on the field. \u201cBut I can\u2019t believe how far they went up.\u201d  Milton got off to a rough start. The sophomore completed just 3 of his first 17 pass attempts, but did do damage with his legs. He scored on an 18-yard run, and Matthew Wright kicked two field goals, including a 45-yarder on the last play of the first half to send the Knights into the locker room with a 13-6 lead.  Auburn opened the second half with two quick scores to take the lead. Jarrett Stidham threw a touchdown pass to Will Hastings, and Kerryon Johnson scored on a 4-yard run that put the Tigers in front 20-13 with 7:55 left in the third quarter.  Trailing 27-20 in the fourth quarter, Auburn was driving before Burkett picked off Stidham and raced into the end zone to give UCF a 14-point lead with six minutes to play.  Auburn\u2019s Eli Stove scored on a 7-yard reverse to cut the UCF lead to 34-27 with 4:12 remaining in the fourth quarter.  Down seven, the Tigers (10-4) marched to the UCF 21-yard line, but Stidham threw his second interception with just seconds left to seal the upset for the Knights.  Milton completed 16 of 35 passes for 242 yards with two touchdowns. He also had 116 yards rushing.  Stidham, who was under constant pressure, completed 28 of 43 passes for 331 with a touchdown and two interceptions.  \u2014Field Level Media"

That was awesome.\u201d  The Fighting Irish, who had lost two of their final three regular-season games, finished 10-3. LSU, which had won six of its last seven regular-season games, finished 9-4.  Book, a sophomore who relieved Brandon Wimbush, completed 14-of-19 passes for 164 yards and was intercepted once. Boykin was named the game\u2019s Most Valuable Player after making three catches for 102 yards.  \u201cWe prepared so well and we stayed positive,\u201d Book said. \u201cMy hat\u2019s off to the other 10 guys (on offense).

Five plays later Danny Etling threw a 20-yard touchdown to running back Derrius Guice to give LSU its first lead.  It was the first touchdown reception of the season for Guice, a junior who is projected to be a first-round pick if he enters the 2018 NFL Draft. Guice rushed 21 times for 98 yards.

Richard Cousins, 58, chief of the world\u2019s biggest catering firm, died together with Emma Bowden, 48, Heather Bowden, 11, Edward Cousins, 23, and William Cousins, 25, according to Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings of the New South Wales Police.  Australian media identified the dead as the CEO\u2019s two sons, his fiancee and her daughter. The pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, also died.  Cousins had been due to retire on March 31.  Compass said the new chief executive, Dominic Blakemore, would now start on Jan. 1 instead of April 1 as originally planned.  Compass, with annual turnover of almost 23 billion pounds ($31 billion), employs around 550,000 people around the world providing food services to schools, the armed forces and office workers.  Blakemore, who has worked at Compass since 2012 with roles as both finance director and head of the group\u2019s European operations, has a background in accounting. He has also held senior financial roles at British food groups Cadbury and Birds Eye Iglo.  Compass Chairman Paul Walsh said in a statement: \u201cThe thoughts of everyone at Compass are with Richard\u2019s family and friends, and we extend our deepest sympathies to them.\u201d  \u201cRichard was known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain\u2019s leading companies,\u201d he added.  Cousins led Compass over the past 11 years. He was widely credited with turning the company\u2019s business around and making Compass into one of the FTSE 100\u2019s best-performing firms, and had also been named as one of the world\u2019s best-performing CEOs by Harvard Business Review.  He joined Tesco as an independent director in 2014 at the height of the British supermarket chain\u2019s accounting scandal, stepping down from that role at the start of 2017.  The family are believed to have been flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay when the plane crashed, the BBC reported.  Police are working with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to recover the wreckage of the plane, which is submerged in 13 metres of water near Cowan, north of Sydney.  A probe into the cause of the crash has begun, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days. Authorities have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened.  The seaplane was part of the Sydney Seaplanes business that offers sight-seeing trips and has operated since 2005 with no previous record of mishap. Seaplane flights have been cancelled until further notice.  Cousins\u2019 son William worked at Open Britain, a group campaigning to keep Britain in the European Union single market, and directors and co-workers praised him as an enthusiastic and talented team member.

          "body": "(Repeats to widen distribution)  By David Shepardson  WASHINGTON, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Airlines recorded zero accident deaths in commercial passenger jets last year, according to a Dutch consulting firm and an aviation safety group that tracks crashes, making 2017 the safest year on record for commercial air travel.  Dutch aviation consulting firm To70 and the Aviation Safety Network both reported Monday there were no commercial passenger jet fatalities in 2017. \u201c2017 was the safest year for aviation ever,\u201d said Adrian Young of To70.  To70 estimated that the fatal accident rate for large commercial passenger flights is 0.06 per million flights, or one fatal accident for every 16 million flights.  The Aviation Safety Network also reported there were no commercial passenger jet deaths in 2017, but 10 fatal airliner accidents resulting in 44 fatalities onboard and 35 persons on the ground, including cargo planes and commercial passenger turbo prop aircraft.  That figure includes 12 people killed on Dec. 31 when a Nature Air Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft crashed minutes after takeoff into a mountainous area off the beach town of Punta Islita, Costa Rica.  In comparison, there were 16 accidents and 303 deaths in 2016 among airliners.  The deadliest incident last year occurred in January when a Turkish cargo jet smashed into a village in Kyrgyzstan as it tried to land at a nearby airport in dense fog, killing 35 on the ground and all four onboard.  The Aviation Safety Network said 2017 was \u201cthe safest year ever, both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in terms of fatalities.\u201d  Over the last two decades aviation deaths around the world have been steadily falling. As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said.  The United States last recorded a fatal airline passenger jet crash in February 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed short of the runway in Clarence Center, New York, killing 49 onboard and one person on the ground.  In 2016, 412 people were killed in the United States in aviation accidents - nearly all in general aviation accidents and none on commercial passenger airlines.  The last fatal passenger jet airliner accident worldwide took place in November 2016 near Medellin, Colombia and the last commercial passenger aircraft crash to kill more than 100 people occurred in October 2015 in Egypt.

Trond Giske, 51, who held several Cabinet posts in Labour governments, recently apologized for what he said was unsuitable behavior but has rejected the most severe allegations as false and unfounded.  \u201cIn light of the demanding situation for the party, and the nature of the case, Trond Giske and I have agreed that he will be relieved of his duty as deputy leader for an indefinite period,\u201d Labour leader Jonas Gahr Stoere said in a statement.

Giske, who is currently on sick leave, confirmed on Monday he had agreed to step aside temporarily from his leadership post, writing on his Facebook page that he hoped it would allow him to respond further to the accusations.  Giske, a former industry minister, culture minister and education minister, remains a member of Norway\u2019s parliament where he is also Labour\u2019s chief spokesman on economic policy.  A number of political, corporate and other leaders in several countries have quit or been fired in recent weeks as women have come forward with accusations of abuse and harassment.  In neighboring Finland, the deputy head of the nationalist Finns Party quit his post on Dec. 19 after harassing a lawmaker in parliament.

In his annual year-end report on the federal judiciary, Roberts said the judicial branch of government was not immune to incidents of sexual harassment and addressing it would be a new challenge in the coming year.   Allegations of systematic sexual harassment and assault  that surfaced against movie producer Harvey Weinstein earlier this year galvanized women to speak out about instances of sexual harassment in the media, government and workplaces across the country.  Earlier this month, renowned San Francisco-based federal appeals judge Alex Kozinski, 67, retired from his lifetime appointment after over a dozen women came forward to accuse him of inappropriate sexual conduct or comments.  In a statement announcing his resignation, Kozinski said that while friends and family had urged him to stay on and defend himself, he could not \u201cbe an effective judge and simultaneously fight this battle.\u201d Reuters has not verified any of the accusations.  \u201cThe judiciary will begin 2018 by undertaking a careful evaluation of whether its standards of conduct and its procedures for investigating and correcting inappropriate behavior are adequate to ensure an exemplary workplace for every judge and every court employee,\u201d Roberts wrote in his report.   Roberts said he asked the federal judiciary\u2019s director of the administrative office to form a working group to examine the courts\u2019 practices and recommend necessary changes to codes of conduct, employee guidance on reporting misconduct and its own rules for investigating complaints.  \u201cI am sure that the overwhelming number have no tolerance for harassment and share the view that victims must have clear and immediate recourse to effective remedies,\u201d he wrote.

New York (21-13-5) notched at least one point for the third game in a row and the seventh time in the past eight contests.  Sam Reinhart and Rasmus Ristolainen scored for Buffalo (10-20-9).  Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist stopped 31 shots to improve to 18-9-4. Sabres goaltender Robin Lehner made 39 saves but fell to 9-14-6.  Miller stood in front of the crease and punched in the game-winner for his eighth goal of the season. A tripping penalty by Sabres center Jacob Josefson set up the 4-on-3 man advantage for New York.  The teams played under clear skies with occasional sunshine and temperatures in the teens. The wind chill dipped to single digits at the stadium, which is home to the New York Mets.  New York opened the scoring 4:09 into the first period on a wrist shot by Carey. The shot marked the Boston College product\u2019s fifth goal of the season and his third in the past six games.  Less than five minutes later, Grabner increased New York\u2019s lead to 2-0 with his team-leading 18th goal.

Bryan Edwards caught five passes for 88 yards and a touchdown for the Gamecocks (9-4).  Wolverines quarterback Brandon Peters completed 20 of 44 passes for 186 yards, but was picked off twice in the fourth quarter.

No more!\u201d\u00a0Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.\u201d  A National Security Council official on Monday said the White House does not plan to send $255 million in aid to Pakistan \u201cat this time\u201d and said \u201cthe administration continues to review Pakistan\u2019s level of cooperation.\u201d In August, the administration had said it was delaying the payment.  Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister, Khawaja M. Asif, wrote on Twitter \u201cWe will respond to President Trump\u2019s tweet shortly inshallah...Will let the world know the truth..difference between facts & fiction.\u201d  It was not immediately clear what prompted Trump\u2019s criticism of Pakistan but he has long complained that\u00a0Islamabad is not doing enough to tackle Islamist militants.  The\u00a0New York Times reported on Dec. 29 that U.S. officials had sought but been denied access to a member of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network captured in Pakistan who potentially could provide information about at least one American hostage.  In countering U.S. criticism, Pakistan says it has\u00a0launched military operations to push out militants from its soil and that\u00a017,000 Pakistanis have died fighting militants or in bombings and other attacks since 2001.  Michael Kugelman, senior associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson Center, cautioned that people should not \u201coverstate the significance of Trump\u2019s tweet for policy.\u201d   Kugelman noted Trump tweeted in October that relations with Pakistan were improving, when some experts suggested they were not.  \u201cStill, this is an administration that has repeatedly vowed to take a harder line and has strongly considered an aid cut. So was Trump\u2019s tweet meant to preview a coming shift in policy? I\u2019d certainly bet on the possibility,\u201d Kugelman said.  In a speech last month in Afghanistan to U.S. troops, Vice President Mike Pence said \u201cfor too long Pakistan has provided safe haven to the Taliban and many terrorist organizations, but those days are over. President Trump has put Pakistan on notice.\u201d  Hamdullah Mohib, Afghanistan\u2019s ambassador in Washington, said in a Twitter posting that Trump\u2019s tweet was a \u201cpromising message to Afghans who have suffered at the hands of terrorists based in Pakistan for far too long.\u201d  U.S. Senator Rand Paul said on Twitter he would lead the charge in the Senate to end aid to Pakistan. \u201cLet\u2019s make this happen,\u201d he said.  The Pakistan embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Austrian top seed Dominic Thiem started his season with a hard-fought 7-6(3) 6-3 victory over Russian Evgeny Donskoy in the first round of the Qatar Open in Doha on Monday.  The world number 5 won a staggering 92 percent of his first serve points to hold off a battling Donskoy, who pushed the 24-year-old to the brink in the opening set, and regained control in the second set to charge to victory.  \u201cIt was a good victory because (of a) tough opponent... after a pretty long period without any matches,\u201d Thiem said. \u201cAfter a good start, it got pretty close in the first set... at the end I\u2019m satisfied with most parts of my game.\u201d  Thiem will play either Slovenia\u2019s Aljaz Bedene or Tunisian wildcard Malek Jaziri in the second round.

Verdasco will face Andrey Rublev in the second round after the Russian was handed a win as German Cedrik-Marcel Stebe retired with the score at 6-1 in the 20-year-old\u2019s favor.

          "title": "As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip their fiscal script",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a \u201cfiscal conservative\u201d on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018.  In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January.  When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress.  President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense \u201cdiscretionary\u201d spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection.  \u201cThe (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: \u2018We\u2019re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,\u2019\u201d Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program.  \u201cNow, Democrats are saying that\u2019s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don\u2019t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people\u2019s money,\u201d he said.  Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party\u2019s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt.  \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,\u201d Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS.  Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich.  \u201cThis is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we\u2019ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we\u2019re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,\u201d Crowley said.  Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or \u201centitlement reform,\u201d as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018.  In Republican parlance, \u201centitlement\u201d programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy.  Democrats seized on Ryan\u2019s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs.  But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown.  Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the \u201cDreamers,\u201d people brought illegally to the country as children.  Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits.  The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers.  Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. \u201cWe need to do DACA clean,\u201d she said.   On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said.  Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.

          "title": "U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump\u2019s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban.  Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration\u2019s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1.  A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings.  \u201cThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD\u2019s study and will continue to defend the president\u2019s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump.  Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen.  Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: \u201cAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.\u201d  Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal \u201cgreat news.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it\u2019s not good for the military or our country,\u201d Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration.  In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military \u201ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\u201d  Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump\u2019s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president\u2019s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law.  The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants\u2019 sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear.  The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept \u201csome individuals who are not medically fit for service.\u201d  The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump\u2019s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president\u2019s ban then put off indefinitely.  Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.

          "body": "ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia is likely to post its first general budget surplus in 2017, Finance Minister Zdravko Maric said on Monday.  \u201cThe official statistical data will be released later on, in the spring but, according to our current data, Croatia has recorded a general budget surplus for last year,\u201d Maric said in an interview for the state television.  The government\u2019s previous forecast was for a deficit of 0.6 percent of gross domestic product.  \u201cIt is certainly the first time that we have ever had a general budget surplus since we have used European Union methodology, but to my knowledge it is also the first such case since Croatia became independent (in 1991),\u201d Maric said.  Croatia joined the EU in 2013.  Maric said the surplus was the result of higher revenues from an excellent tourist season and improved tax collection.  He said public debt at the end of 2017 was now forecast to be 78 percent of GDP instead of 80 percent.  At the end of 2016, public debt was close to 83 percent of GDP, and reducing it is a priority for Croatia as it wants to adopt the euro within seven or eight years.  The budget plan approved in November foresees a budget deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2018, a balanced budget in 2019 and a surplus of 0.8 percent in 2020.  Strong fiscal consolidation in the last three years has helped to reduce the fiscal gap from more than 5 percent of GDP.  However, some analysts say the budget is still overly reliant on better revenues, and that expenditure needs to be cut harder.  Many cite the need to slim down a costly public sector as a key to improving the investment climate and growth prospects.  Economic growth is currently around 3 percent, but many analysts say that, without reforms, it will be hard to maintain growth above 2 percent in the longer term.

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s Bavarian conservatives are pressing for corporate tax cuts and cuts to welfare payments for asylum seekers, which could complicate talks with the Social Democrats (SPD) on forming a new government.  Chancellor Angela Merkel hopes to secure a fourth term in office by persuading the center-left SPD to extend the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that ruled Germany for the past four years, even though both blocs suffered big losses in September\u2019s election.  Exploratory talks are scheduled from Jan. 7 to Jan 12.  The SPD, which initially wanted to stay in opposition, has agreed to explore the possibility in the interest of political stability after Merkel\u2019s coalition talks with two smaller parties collapsed in November. But SPD officials have made no promises.  Policy papers prepared by Bavaria\u2019s CSU, sister party to Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, point to difficult negotiations ahead at a time when Merkel and others are calling for quick work to form a stable new government.   The CSU, historically more conservative than Merkel\u2019s larger party, will play a key role in the coalition talks. The two conservative parties have presented a more unified front in recent months after prolonged conflict over Merkel\u2019s decision in 2015 to welcome more than one million migrants to Germany.   In a paper leaked last week, the CSU said it wanted military spending to reach NATO\u2019s target of 2 percent of national output, called for a hardline position on immigration, and rejected closer European integration, charting a collision course with the SPD.  Now, draft policy papers prepared for a CSU party meeting this week set up further conflicts.  In one paper, first reported by German magazine Focus, the CSU calls for cuts in corporate tax rates, given U.S. tax cuts and similar moves afoot in Britain and France.  \u201cIf Germany does not act, it will in the near future have one of the highest corporate tax rates in international comparison,\u201d the paper said.  SPD parliamentary group leader Andrea Nahles has called for increasing taxes on the wealthy. Her party is pressing for more spending on infrastructure, education, health care and other social priorities.   Another CSU paper called for cuts in benefits for asylum seekers to discourage more migrants from coming to Germany, the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper reported late on Monday.  Instead of transitioning to higher regular welfare payments after 15 months, asylum-seekers would continue to receive the lower basic aid for 36 months.  \u201cWe want to reduce social welfare payments for asylum seekers so that Germany does not remain the main magnet for refugees from the whole world,\u201d Alexander Dobrindt, a top CSU official told the newspaper.  Pressure is mounting on Merkel to form a new government three months after the election.  Former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, now president of the lower house of parliament, said on Saturday he could not rule out a minority government if no deal emerged.  Another alternative would be a new election, but political experts say that could result in further gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which parlayed concerns about migration to enter parliament for the first time in September.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Airlines recorded zero accident deaths in commercial passenger jets last year, according to a Dutch consulting firm and an aviation safety group that tracks crashes, making 2017 the safest year on record for commercial air travel.  Dutch aviation consulting firm To70 and the Aviation Safety Network both reported Monday there were no commercial passenger jet fatalities in 2017. \u201c2017 was the safest year for aviation ever,\u201d said Adrian Young of To70.  To70 estimated that the fatal accident rate for large commercial passenger flights is 0.06 per million flights, or one fatal accident for every 16 million flights.  The Aviation Safety Network also reported there were no commercial passenger jet deaths in 2017, but 10 fatal airliner accidents resulting in 44 fatalities onboard and 35 persons on the ground, including cargo planes and commercial passenger turbo prop aircraft.  That figure includes 12 people killed on Dec. 31 when a  Nature Air Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft crashed minutes after takeoff into a mountainous area off the beach town of Punta Islita, Costa Rica. [nL1N1OW0A3]   In comparison, there were 16 accidents and 303 deaths in 2016 among airliners.  The deadliest incident last year occurred in January when a  Turkish cargo jet smashed into a village in Kyrgyzstan as it tried to land at a nearby airport in dense fog, killing 35 on the ground and all four onboard.  The Aviation Safety Network said 2017 was \u201cthe safest year ever, both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in terms of fatalities.\u201d  Over the last two decades aviation deaths around the world have been steadily falling. As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said.  The United States last recorded a fatal airline passenger jet crash in February 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed short of the runway in Clarence Center, New York, killing 49 onboard and one person on the ground.  In 2016, 412 people were killed in the United States in aviation accidents - nearly all in general aviation accidents and none on commercial passenger airlines.  The last fatal passenger jet airliner accident worldwide took place in November 2016 near Medellin, Colombia and the last commercial passenger aircraft crash to kill more than 100 people occurred in October 2015 in Egypt.

          "title": "Drinking hot tea linked to lowered glaucoma risk",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - People who drink hot tea daily may be less likely than others to develop glaucoma symptoms, U.S. researchers say.  Compared to coffee, soft drink and iced tea drinkers, study participants who consumed a cup or more of hot caffeinated tea daily had 74 percent lower odds of having glaucoma, the study authors report in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.  \u201cGlaucoma can lead to blindness, and it would be great if it could be prevented because there is no cure,\u201d said lead author Dr. Anne Coleman of the University of California, Los Angeles.   \u201cThe best way to prevent it is to get your eyes checked,\u201d Coleman told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. \u201cBut we are also interested in lifestyle habits and what we can do to make a difference.\u201d  Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, affecting an estimated 58 million people. That includes more than three million Americans, only half of whom are aware they have the disease, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation.   Coffee, or caffeine in general have previously been linked to increased glaucoma risk, although recent studies don\u2019t agree, Coleman and her colleagues write.   To evaluate the relationship between specific caffeinated drinks and glaucoma, Coleman and colleagues analyzed data on a sample of more than 10,000 people in the U.S. who were representative of the entire population. Participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2005-2006 answered questions about their diets and lifestyles, had medical exams and blood tests and also underwent eye examinations.  About 1,700 participants were over age 40, had no other known eye diseases and had full eye examination results from the survey. In this group, Coleman\u2019s team found that just over 5 percent, 82 people, had glaucoma.   Almost half of participants reported drinking coffee often, but less than 10 percent drank hot tea daily. The research team found no associations between coffee, iced tea, decaffeinated tea or soft drink consumption and the likelihood of having glaucoma.   \u201cTea drinkers should keep drinking and don\u2019t need to stop because of a fear of glaucoma,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThis makes sense, but we\u2019ll see if it holds up in future studies.\u201d  Future studies should look at the habits, activities and nutrition that affect lifestyle and glaucoma risks, said Idan Hecht of Tel-Aviv University in Israel, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.   \u201cIn the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in interest, and subsequently research, into the ways lifestyle changes can influence diseases,\u201d Hecht told Reuters Health by email.  Recent research indicates that vitamins C, E and zinc can help vision. Other studies indicate that antioxidants in tea could have similar effects, he noted.  \u201cPatients can and should be involved and take an active role in the management of their ailments,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cExercising, eating healthy and trying novel ways to improve your health is something you should definitely explore and bring up with your physician.\u201d  Environmental factors could play a role in glaucoma risk as well, said Dr. Ahmad Aref at the University of Illinois at Chicago.   \u201cAs our population grows older, we need to think about the other factors that could help, particularly when it comes to the health benefits of physical activity,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone.  Overall, both medical and non-medical approaches are key to treating the disease in the future, Aref added.  \u201cIt\u2019s a tough disease because we don\u2019t have a way to bring vision back once it\u2019s lost,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we can do is prevent it from getting worse, and we want to help patients do that.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2Bszp7c British Journal of Ophthalmology, online December 14, 2017."

In the study of 9- and 10-year-olds, the kids who ate carry-out most often also consumed more calories but fewer vitamins and minerals compared with kids who rarely or never ate carry-out food, the authors report in Archives of Disease in Childhood.  \u201cFrequent consumption of takeaway foods could potentially be increasing children\u2019s risk of future coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes by increasing their LDL cholesterol and body fat,\u201d lead author Angela Donin told Reuters Health in an email.  \u201cTakeaway outlets are increasing, as is consumption with more than half of teenagers reporting eating takeaways at least twice a week,\u201d said Donin, a researcher at St. George\u2019s, University of London.  In adults, regular consumption of carry-out meals is associated with higher risk of obesity, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but little is known about the effects it may be having on children\u2019s health, Donin said.   \u201cWe, therefore, wanted to see how much takeaway food children were eating and if there were any effects on their health.\u201d  The researchers analyzed data from the Child Heart and Health Study in England, which looked at potential risk factors for heart disease and diabetes in pre-teens. Participants included about 2,000 kids aged 9 and 10 years at 85 primary schools in three cities: London, Birmingham and Leicester.  The children answered questions about their usual diets, including how often they ate carry-out meals purchased from restaurants. Foods purchased at convenience stores or grocery stores were not included in the category. Photos of common foods were provided to help the kids recall and estimate portion sizes.   About one quarter of the children said they never or rarely ate carry-out meals and nearly half said they ate carry-out less than once per week. Just over one quarter said they ate these kinds of meals at least once per week.  Boys were more frequent consumers of carry-out meals than girls, as were children from less affluent backgrounds.   The study team used the kids\u2019 dietary responses to calculate calorie counts and nutrient intake. Among regular consumers of carry-out meals, the foods eaten were higher-calorie and higher-fat, while protein and starch intake was lower and intake of vitamin C, iron, calcium and folate was also lower compared with kids who didn\u2019t eat these types of meals.   Researchers also measured the children\u2019s height, weight, waist circumference, skinfold thickness and body-fat composition. In addition, they measured blood pressure and took blood samples for cholesterol levels.   There were no differences in blood pressure or how well the kids\u2019 bodies used insulin based on who regularly ate carry-out meals. But skinfold thickness, body fat composition and blood fats like LDL (bad) cholesterol all tended to be higher in regular consumers of carry-out meals.  \u201cChildren who ate more takeaway meals had higher total and LDL cholesterol (both important risk factors for coronary heart disease) and body fat.,\u201d Donin said.  \u201cMost people who order takeout usually purchase fast food, which is high in sodium, fat, and calories,\u201d noted Sandra Arevalo, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   \u201cFast-food also has low nutritional value, which means it is low in vitamins, minerals, fiber and sometimes protein,\u201d said Arevalo, a registered dietician who directs Nutrition Services and Community Outreach at Community Pediatrics, a program of Montefiore and The Children\u2019s Health Fund, in New York. \u201cIf you eat these meals over a long period of time you can start seeing the health consequences associated with it.\u201d  Arevalo recommends parents who need to bring home a meal, call the restaurant ahead of time to order salads, vegetables, brown rice, grilled meats and to provide a healthier meal for their children.   \u201cThe price might be a deterrent but you can cut portions in half and get two meals out of one large one,\u201d she said by email. Another idea is to learn to prepare quick and healthy meals.  \u201cFor example, hummus, carrots, and crackers make a great lunch, as well as a tuna or turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes. Eggs are an excellent source of protein, you can scramble an egg with spinach, onions, and tomatoes and have it with a toast,\u201d she said.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Airlines recorded zero accident deaths in commercial passenger jets last year, according to a Dutch consulting firm and an aviation safety group that tracks crashes, making 2017 the safest year on record for commercial air travel.  Dutch aviation consulting firm To70 and the Aviation Safety Network both reported Monday there were no commercial passenger jet fatalities in 2017. \u201c2017 was the safest year for aviation ever,\u201d said Adrian Young of To70.  To70 estimated that the fatal accident rate for large commercial passenger flights is 0.06 per million flights, or one fatal accident for every 16 million flights.  The Aviation Safety Network also reported there were no commercial passenger jet deaths in 2017, but 10 fatal airliner accidents resulting in 44 fatalities onboard and 35 persons on the ground, including cargo planes and commercial passenger turbo prop aircraft.  That figure includes 12 people killed on Dec. 31 when a  Nature Air Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft crashed minutes after takeoff into a mountainous area off the beach town of Punta Islita, Costa Rica. [nL1N1OW0A3]   In comparison, there were 16 accidents and 303 deaths in 2016 among airliners.  The deadliest incident last year occurred in January when a  Turkish cargo jet smashed into a village in Kyrgyzstan as it tried to land at a nearby airport in dense fog, killing 35 on the ground and all four onboard.  The Aviation Safety Network said 2017 was \u201cthe safest year ever, both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in terms of fatalities.\u201d  Over the last two decades aviation deaths around the world have been steadily falling. As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said.  The United States last recorded a fatal airline passenger jet crash in February 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed short of the runway in Clarence Center, New York, killing 49 onboard and one person on the ground.  In 2016, 412 people were killed in the United States in aviation accidents - nearly all in general aviation accidents and none on commercial passenger airlines.  The last fatal passenger jet airliner accident worldwide took place in November 2016 near Medellin, Colombia and the last commercial passenger aircraft crash to kill more than 100 people occurred in October 2015 in Egypt.

          "title": "Medical jargon may cloud doctor-patient communication",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - When patients misunderstand commonly used medical terms, communication and decision-making may suffer, UK researchers say.  In a survey of London oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic patients, more than a third of participants did not know the meaning of terms like \u201cbenign\u201d or \u201clesion\u201d and more than half could not define \u201cmetastasis\u201d or \u201clymph node,\u201d the study team reports in the British Dental Journal.   Communication between patient and practitioner is essential, the researchers write, but it may not be happening as often as doctors think it is.    \u201cAs a result, ill-informed patients tend to neglect timely treatment which can lead to very bad - sometimes disastrous - outcomes,\u201d said Dr. Sidney Eisig of Columbia University\u2019s College of Dental Medicine in New York, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.  \u201cI\u2019ve seen patients with premalignant lesions turn to cancer that otherwise might not have occurred had surgical treatment not been so delayed,\u201d he told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.  Emma Hayes of King\u2019s College Hospital, London, and her colleagues recruited 123 patients waiting for their appointments at the hospital\u2019s outpatient clinic to anonymously answer questionnaires about the meanings of several medical terms. Participants also provided background information about themselves, including education level and whether English was their first language.   In a multiple-choice section of the questionnaire, they were asked to define: blister, ulcer, malignant, lesion and benign. In a free-written answer section, they were also asked to describe in their own words the meanings of: biopsy, tumor, lymph node, pre-malignant and metastasis.   Hayes\u2019 team found that 90 percent of respondents correctly defined blister as a bubble of fluid under the skin. Ulcer came in at a distant second with just 70 percent choosing the appropriate definition as an open sore or break in the skin.  \u201cThe words blister and ulcer are frequently used in medical areas unrelated to dental care, which may explain why the two are the most recognized medical lexicon,\u201d Eisig noted. \u201cFor example, a patient experienced foot or hand blisters in the past. A friend or family member once had a stomach ulcer.\u201d  Forty-five percent of patients were able to define a biopsy as a test involving taking a sample, but 30 percent wrongly defined it as a test specifically for cancer.    Benign and metastasis were the least understood terms, with 33 percent of patients responding \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d  for the meaning of benign and just 6 percent correctly defining metastasis as the spread of a cancer to other areas of the body. Many patients also seemed to mistake \u201cmetastasis\u201d for other words, offering responses such as \u201cfoot bone\u201d (metatarsal) or \u201cbreast condition, very painful\u201d (mastitis).  The researchers found that nearly 27 percent of participants did not speak English as a first language, which is a higher rate than London as a whole, at 22 percent, they note. But when the researchers looked just at those whose first language was English, they saw no differences in the number of correct answers based on educational level.  The study authors did not respond to a request for comments.  According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providers in many fields, including  emergency room settings, surgery requiring anesthetics and breast cancer clinics, grapple with how best to effectively communicate with patients.    Efforts to bridge this gap include encouraging the use of plainer language in written materials and providing interpreting services for non-English speakers.    Eisig notes that some of the biggest challenges to effectively communicating with patients stem from growing bureaucracy within healthcare and are not so easily remedied.   \u201cOver the past decade or so there have been many changes to healthcare, many of which are driven by finances. Some of these changes aren\u2019t always beneficial,\u201d he said.   \u201cFrequently the doctor\u2019s back may be to the patient as entries are being made into the electronic health record. Doctor-patient communication is now being done increasingly through email. These are just two examples that may lead to communication failures because practitioners are spending less time with patients, which results in diminished relationships thus increasing the likelihood for patient misinterpretation.\u201d  SOURCE: go.nature.com/2zMEzbt British Dental Journal, online December 1, 2017."

          "body": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis described migrants and refugees as the world\u2019s \u201cweakest and most needy\u201d on Monday, using his traditional New Year\u2019s address to \u201cgive voice\u201d to people he has urged leaders to do more to help.  Francis reminded some 40,000 people who gathered in St. Peter\u2019s Square at the Vatican that he had chosen the plight of migrants and refugees as the theme for the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s World Day of Peace, which is celebrated every January 1.  \u201cFor this peace, to which everyone has a right, many of them are willing to risk their lives in a journey which is often long and dangerous, they are willing to face strain and suffering.\u201d  \u201cPlease, let us not extinguish the hope in their hearts, let us not suffocate their hopes for peace!\u201d  Across the world, the mass movement of people has shot to the top of the political agenda, and Francis has made defending those who migrate a central theme of his papacy.   During a trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh last year, he met Muslim refugees and called for decisive measures to solve the political problems that caused many to flee.   He has also criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s stated intention to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants.  In a homily earlier on Monday, Francis said everyone should look after their soul by taking a moment of silence every day, \u201cto keep our freedom from being corroded by the banality of consumerism, the blare of commercials, the stream of empty words and the overpowering waves of empty chatter and loud shouting\u201d.  In a message released in November ahead of the World Day of Peace, Francis said politicians who stoke fear of migrants were sowing violence and racism. He acknowledged that the presence of immigrants can compound existing problems in a country, but appealed for practical ways to be found to welcome newcomers.   On Monday, he said: \u201cIt is important that there is a commitment from everyone, from civil institutions, and those in education, welfare and church organizations, to ensure a peaceful future for refugees, migrants, everyone.\u201d      Reporting by Isla Binnie; editing by Jason Neely"

          "title": "California launches legal sale of cannabis for recreational use",
          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California will launch the world\u2019s largest regulated commercial market for recreational marijuana on Monday, as dozens of newly licensed stores catering to adults who enjoy the drug for its psychoactive effects open for business up and down the state.  It becomes the sixth U.S. state, and by far the most populous, venturing beyond legalized medical marijuana to permit the sale of cannabis products of all types to customers at least 21 years old.  Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Nevada were the first to introduce recreational pot sales on a state-regulated, licensed and taxed basis. Massachusetts and Maine are on track to follow suit later this year.  With California and its 39.5 million residents officially joining the pack, more than one-in-five Americans now live in states where recreational marijuana is legal for purchase, even though cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under U.S. law.  The marijuana market in California alone, which boasts the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy, is valued by most experts at several billion dollars annually and is expected to generate at least a $1 billion a year in tax revenue.  \u201cAdding California to the regulated [recreational] market for cannabis is a really big deal,\u201d said Heather Azzi, a senior attorney for the Marijuana Policy Project, an advocacy group working to liberalize marijuana laws.  Uruguay became the first and only country to legalize recreational marijuana sales nationally, permitted through its pharmacies starting in July 2017, but is far smaller in comparison, with a population of just 3.4 million.  Still, most California jurisdictions are sitting out the highly anticipated New Year\u2019s Day inauguration of recreational cannabis sales.  Many, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, will not be ready for days or weeks because of additional red tape required by city and county governments before would-be retailers can obtain their state licenses.  But business will almost certainly be brisk at newly permitted shops ready on Day One. They number about four-dozen outlets across California, according to an authoritative guide to the cannabis market, GreenState, published by the San Francisco Chronicle.  Stores authorized to carry recreational weed were set to go on New Year\u2019s Day in San Diego, San Jose, Santa Cruz, Oakland, Berkeley, Eureka and Desert Hot Springs, among other locales. Hundreds more are expected to open throughout the state as the year progresses.  Many previously operated strictly as medical cannabis dispensaries under a patchwork of local regulations, and will now be licensed by the state for recreational merchandise as well.  Among the very first will be the Oakland-based Harborside dispensary, which has long ranked as the largest U.S. medical marijuana outlet. It planned to opens its doors at 6 a.m. local time on Monday.  Customers in the recreational sector - which state regulators prefer to call the \u201cadult use\u201d market - are only permitted to buy an ounce (28 grams) of raw cannabis or its equivalent at a time.  Medical patients can buy unlimited quantities, but must present a doctor\u2019s note and have purchased a medical ID card.  The stage for Monday\u2019s grand opening was set when voters passed a ballot measure in November 2016, Proposition 64, immediately legalizing personal possession and use of recreational pot by adults 21 and over.  But it has taken California lawmakers and bureaucrats over a year to devise a licensing, regulatory and tax structure for all phases of the commercial distribution chain.  California in 1996 became the first state to legalize marijuana for medical use, and more than 30 states have since done likewise.   Reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Kim Coghill"

The incident took place just days after attacks on a Coptic church and another Christian-owned shop also south of the Egyptian capital that killed more than 10 people, as security forces brace for attacks against the Arab world\u2019s largest Christian minority ahead of Orthodox Christmas celebrations.  The gunman used a rifle in the attack, shooting at the shop from outside after pulling up on a motorcycle, two security sources said. The attacker fled the scene afterwards.

          "title": "Informal caregiving linked to sleep problems",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - For people who are in the workforce already, the added burden of unpaid caregiving for a family member or loved one may lead to insomnia and other sleep issues, according to a large study from Sweden.  Researchers found that the likelihood of sleep problems rose with the number of hours spent in unpaid caregiving, and when caregiving stopped, sleep disturbances were reduced.  \u201cInformal caregiving is common, and the need for carers is expected to grow due to population aging and cuts to social care services in various countries,\u201d said lead study author Lawrence Sacco of the Institute of Gerontology at King\u2019s College London in the UK.  Caregivers often face conflicting schedules and feel a sense of obligation, leaving some with little or no choice about when and how to help loved ones, he noted.  \u201cSleeping problems are common and deserve attention because people with insomnia are more likely to suffer from other physical illnesses,\u201d Sacco told Reuters Health by email. \u201cSleep disturbance and tiredness are also symptoms of depression and other mood disorders.\u201d  Sacco and his colleagues at the Stress Research Institute at Stockholm University analyzed responses from 12,200 participants in the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health, a questionnaire mailed every two years to employed residents of Sweden aged 16 to 64. The researchers focused on surveys in 2010 through 2016.   They defined informal caregivers as those who, without pay, help or care for an elderly, ill or disabled relative other than a child or grandchild. Participants were asked how many hours they typically spend on this caregiving each week.  They were also asked how often in the prior three months they had difficulties falling asleep, repeated awakenings, premature awakenings or restless sleep.   About 85 percent of the survey participants were not caregivers, while 12 percent spent 1 to 5 hours providing care each week and 2 percent spent anywhere from 6 to 15 hours caregiving.    After adjusting for social and economic factors, as well as the caregiver\u2019s own health status, the researchers found that sleep problems were more common among caregivers overall, and most common among those who provided more than five hours a week.   When caregiving ceased from one survey year to the following one, researchers saw a drop in reported sleep troubles.  Caregivers were more likely to be female and older, to have less education, to work less than 20 paid hours per week and to report physical pain, chronic illness, poor health and depression.   \u201cThis means that increases in informal caregiving that are expected in the years ahead as a result of population aging may hit those who are already struggling the hardest,\u201d Sacco said.  The study team saw no difference in sleep problems between men who provided no care versus those who provided up to five hours of caregiving, but women reported sleep problems at all levels of caregiving. That could be related to the different tasks that men and women perform as caregivers, the authors write in the journal Sleep.  Future studies should look at working people in various countries, Sacco added, since Sweden uses a welfare model aimed at minimizing conflict between paid work and caregiving commitments.   \u201cThis is a wake-up call to governments and employers that they should be supporting informal caregivers better,\u201d he said.  In addition, future research should examine what types and aspects of caregiving affect sleep the most, said Dr. Barry Oken of Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.  \u201cCaregiving at home for someone with dementia or chronic pain may cause more problems with the care recipient\u2019s sleep and perhaps then the caregiver\u2019s sleep,\u201d he told Reuters Health by email.  Oken said he is interested in finding ways to help caregivers improve their sleep. In recent studies, he and colleagues have found that mind-body practices, such as mindfulness meditation, can improve mental health in caregivers and stressed older adults.  \u201cBe aware that sleeping may be impacted by caregiving and explore with health providers what you can do to minimize it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat society can do to help minimize this is alluded to here but is a bigger question.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2CmAT5X Sleep, online December 8, 2017."

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - In a battle of box office heavyweights, Luke Skywalker just managed to hold off Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson as the world rang in another year.  Disney and LucasFilm\u2019s \u201c\u201dStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d retained first place for the four-day New Year\u2019s holiday weekend despite steep competition from Sony\u2019s \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.\u201d \u201cLast Jedi\u201d picked up an estimated $68.4 million, bringing its domestic haul to $533.1 million.  Don\u2019t weep for \u201cJumanji,\u201d however. The fantasy reboot, which finds Johnson, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart transported into a video game world, has outperformed expectations, picking up a lordly $66.5 million over the holiday weekend. It now has a hefty $185.7 million domestic gross and should continue to draw crowds in 2018. The \u201cJumanji\u201d sequel has also done well internationally, racking up $350 million worldwide, and has provided a much-needed hit for a studio that has struggled to keep pace with the Disney\u2019s and Warner Bros.\u2019s of the world. Sony claims the film has a $90 million budget. Those alleged production costs have raised eyebrows around town as to their veracity given the film\u2019s Hawaii location and starry cast, but regardless of creative accounting and aggressive spinning, the result is impressive. A sequel seems preordained.  \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d closed 2017 as the year\u2019s highest-grossing release and the seventh highest-grossing domestic movie of all time with $517.1 million. It will bypass its fellow franchisee \u201cRogue One\u201d at some point on New Year\u2019s Day to take the seventh spot on the stateside charts and has already blown past the $1 billion mark globally. The film carries a $200 million price tag, and has generated controversy for a series of creative decisions by director and writer Rian Johnson that have, depending on your perspective, either infused new energy into decades-old series or deviated dangerously from the Jedi canon.  It\u2019s been a dismal year for the domestic box office, which ends 2017 with $11.12 billion in sales, down 2.3% from last year\u2019s $11.38 billion and off slightly from 2015\u2019s $11.14 billion, according to comScore. After a bruising summer, when revenues plummeted more than 6% in the wake of costly flops such as \u201cThe Mummy\u201d and \u201cTransformer: The Last Knight,\u201d the gap did narrow. Fall and winter hits such as \u201cIt,\u201d \u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d \u201cCoco,\u201d and \u201cMurder on the Orient Express,\u201d helped make up the difference. The industry was also aided by record ticket prices. Empirically, fewer people made it to the multiplexes. Attendance is expected to hit a 27-year low when official numbers are tallied.  Universal\u2019s \u201cPitch Perfect 3\u201d took third place on the stateside charts, grossing $22.7 million for the four-day period and pushing its domestic total to just under $70 million. The a Cappella comedy carries a $45 million production budget and has been billed as the final installment in the franchise.  Hugh Jackman\u2019s musical drama \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d is finishing a close fourth with $20.7 million. The Fox-Chernin Entertainment production chronicles the rise of circus impresario P.T. Barnum. It got a boost from the holidays, and showed the biggest gain in the top 10 movies from the Christmas Eve weekend with an impressive 73% surge. The domestic total should hit $54.3 million through Monday. It\u2019s a pricey movie, though. All that singing and dancing didn\u2019t come cheap and \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d cost $84 million to make.  Fox\u2019s second weekend of \u201cFerdinand\u201d rounded out the top five with $14.6 million, giving the animated comedy $56.8 million domestically.  Not every film was feeling the holiday spirit. Paramount\u2019s \u201cDownsizing\u201d is a costly bomb. The comedy about a man (Matt Damon) who shrinks to the size of thimble in order to live in a materialistic utopia collapsed at the box office, eking out $6.1 million over the long weekend. Its total stands at $18.5 million \u2014 a paltry result given its $65 million budget. It also prolongs a box office losing streak for Damon. The actor also struck out with \u201cSuburbicon\u201d and \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d both of which opened during and flopped in 2017.  Warner Bros. and Alcon\u2019s comedy \u201cFather Figures\u201d was another casualty of the Christmas crunch. The story of two twin brothers (Ed Helms and Owen Wilson) on a quest to find their biological father netted $5.1 million over the four-day weekend. Its total tops out at $14.1 million, making it unlikely that it will recoup its $25 million production budget as well its marketing costs.  And Sony\u2019s \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d struggled to appeal to older audiences. The drama about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III attracted lots of attention for the filmmakers\u2019 last minute decision to re-cast a key role played by disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. The breakneck reshoots took place in a matter of weeks, with Christopher Plummer assuming the Spacey part as parsimonious billionaire J. Paul Getty, and added $10 million to the film\u2019s $40 million budget. Alas, audiences failed to show up. The movie grossed $7.5 million over the holiday weekend, bringing its domestic total to $14.7 million.  Foreign audiences picked up the slack as domestic attendance sputtered in 2017. The global box office is projected to hit $40 billion for the first time in history, propelled by the return of China. Total ticket sales in the Middle Kingdom grew by 22.3%, ending the year with $8.6 billion in revenues. That, at least, gives a beleaguered movie business some cause for celebration."

          "title": "Crisis of expectations: Iran protests mean economic dilemma for government",
          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani may have to step back from some of his core economic policies in the face of nationwide protests by tens of thousands of people frustrated by high unemployment and stagnant living standards.  The protests, during which at least 10 people have been killed, are fueled by disappointment that the lifting of sanctions on Iran in January 2016 has failed to deliver an economic boom.  Instead, the non-oil part of the economy has continued to struggle, with unemployment officially put at around 12.5 percent - in reality, much higher for Iran\u2019s millions of young people - and inflation running at nearly 10 percent.  \u201cThere is a crisis of expectations in Iran,\u201d said Tamer Badawi, a research fellow at the Istanbul-based Al-Sharq Forum.     \u201cIt is a deep sense of economic frustration.\u201d  To ease that discontent, Rouhani may need to spend more government money on creating jobs, restrain inflation by supporting the rial exchange rate and do more to eradicate the widespread corruption which angers the protesters.  But all of those actions would involve policy change. Rouhani has been pursuing a conservative budget policy to bring Iran\u2019s volatile state finances under control, part of his effort to create an attractive environment for foreign investors. Meanwhile, fighting corruption would risk a backlash from powerful interests hurt by a crackdown.  Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian economist who is head of energy risk analysis at the Betamatrix consultancy in London, said Rouhani faced a \u201cHerculean challenge\u201d fighting corruption in particular. But he suggested Rouhani might have no choice.  \u201cPeople are more and more desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this situation, there will be periodic outbreaks of dissent.\u201d  After taking power in 2013, Rouhani quickly reversed the spendthrift fiscal and monetary policies of his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, curbing a system of cash handouts for lower- and middle-income Iranians.   Last month he proposed another conservative budget to parliament for the Iranian year starting next March 21. The  $104 billion budget was up about 6 percent from the plan for the current year - a cut in real terms at current inflation rates.  Such austerity has become increasingly unpopular among the public as the economy has struggled despite the end of sanctions. Many foreign banks and companies remain reluctant to do business with Iran, partly because U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s hard line on Tehran has deterred trade and investment.  Emadi said a study to which he contributed found Iranians were dissatisfied with the economy for five main reasons: unemployment, weak purchasing power, corruption, a weak rial, and unequal distribution of wealth among Iran\u2019s regions.  The study showed their perceptions of the first three areas have worsened this year, he said. In some areas of southeast Iran, unemployment among young people has reached 45 percent and the job market is shrinking, he added.  The rial has sunk to 42,900 against the U.S. dollar from 36,000\u00a0a year ago. Rouhani\u2019s administration might support the currency by spending more of Iran\u2019s foreign reserves, but this would risk deterring foreign investment; the International Monetary Fund warned against such a policy last month.  Emadi blamed much of the economy\u2019s poor performance on a deep-rooted structural issue: the influence of paramilitary bodies such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as well as religious institutions on business.  Those interests, which according to some estimates control over 60 percent of assets in Iran, generally do not pay taxes and stifle competition from small private companies, blocking job creation, he said.  Emadi said Rouhani\u2019s administration was addressing this problem, pressing institutions to open their books to tax audits and demanding more transparency in the business world.  But Badawi predicted the government would find it hard to secure any quick improvement in the economy.  While it may announce a stimulus package to create jobs, it is unlikely to backtrack on cash handouts, and problems such as diversifying the economy and repairing a debt-burdened banking system can only be solved in the long term, he said.  \u201cMy guess is that nothing significant will change. The government will try to be open with people, to propose initiatives, but there are structural problems - diversification, the banking problem and relations with the rest of world, especially Trump.\u201d    Reporting by Andrew Torchia; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"

          "body": "OFER PRISON, West Bank (Reuters) - Israel indicted a 16-year-old Palestinian girl on Monday on charges including assault for punching an Israeli soldier in the face two weeks ago, an incident which made her into a hero for Palestinians and was seen as humiliating by right-wing Israelis.  Israel has held Ahed Tamimi since arresting her three days after she was filmed punching the soldier at the entrance to her family home in a village in the occupied West Bank. The confrontation took place after what Israel says was a stone-throwing assault on its troops.  The case has made her into such a potent symbol for Palestinians that a commentator in Israeli left-wing newspaper Haaretz said Israel risked turning her into the \u201cPalestinian Joan of Arc\u201d.  Right-wing Israelis, meanwhile, have debated whether the soldier had appeared weak by opting not to strike back. The Israeli army said he \u201cacted professionally\u201d by showing restraint.  The charge sheet against Tamimi, seen by Reuters, included counts of aggravated assault against a soldier, who the army said was bruised on his brow by her punch, obstructing a soldier in the performance of his duty and throwing stones at troops.   \u201cTamimi threw stones at them (the soldiers), threatened them, obstructed them in fulfilling their duty, took part in riots and incited others to take part in them,\u201d the military said on its public affairs Twitter account.  Qadoura Fares, chairman of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which advocates on behalf of Palestinians in Israeli jails, said the charges were false.  \u201cTheir aim is to terrorize people, and they are trying to deter children and others,\u201d he said.  Tamimi\u2019s lawyer, Gaby Lasky, said she was certain some of the charges would eventually be dismissed, but nonetheless prosecutors may seek the maximum penalty for other counts.   \u201cI am sure they want to keep her as long as possible because they don\u2019t want the voice of resistance outside prison,\u201d Lasky told Reuters at the military courtroom in Ofer prison near the Palestinian city of Ramallah.    Tamimi was not asked to enter a plea at this stage. The military court gave her lawyer more time to study the charges.  An adult found guilty of assaulting a soldier could be jailed for up to 10 years, but such an outcome would be unlikely for Tamimi as a minor.     The incident occurred at the entrance to Tamimi\u2019s family home in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh, where weekly protests against Israeli settlement policy have been held for years. Tamimi\u2019s father is a prominent Palestinian activist.   Tamimi made news two years ago when she was pictured biting a soldier who tried to arrest her younger brother. In 2012 she was presented with an award in Turkey and met its president,  Tayyip Erdogan, after images of her confronting an Israeli soldier went viral.

          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Iranian anti-government protesters on Monday, while denying as \u201claughable\u201d Tehran\u2019s apparent accusations that Israel was behind the demonstrations.  Five days of protests in Iran have posed the boldest challenge to its clerical leadership since pro-reform unrest in 2009. At least ten people have been reported killed as some confrontations with police turned violent.  \u201cI wish the Iranian people success in their noble quest for freedom,\u201d Netanyahu said in a video posted on his Facebook page.  \u201cBrave Iranians are pouring into the streets. They seek freedom. They seek justice. They seek the basic liberties that have been denied them for decades. Iran\u2019s cruel regime wastes tens of billions of dollars spreading hate,\u201d he said in remarks that echoed similar praise from U.S. President Donald Trump.   On Monday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was quoted by state media as apparently blaming Iran\u2019s arch enemies, the United States and Israel, for provoking unrest.   \u201cOur success in the political arena against the United States and the Zionist regime was unbearable to (Iran\u2019s enemies).

Netanyahu said Rouhani\u2019s suggestion that Israel was involved was \u201cnot only false \u2014 it\u2019s laughable\u201d.  Netanyahu added that more Western countries should condemn Tehran for trying to put down the protests.  \u201cSadly many European governments watch in silence as young heroic Iranians are beaten in the streets.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - In a battle of box office heavyweights, Luke Skywalker just managed to hold off Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson as the world rang in another year.  Disney and LucasFilm\u2019s \u201c\u201dStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d retained first place for the four-day New Year\u2019s holiday weekend despite steep competition from Sony\u2019s \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.\u201d \u201cLast Jedi\u201d picked up an estimated $68.4 million, bringing its domestic haul to $533.1 million.  Don\u2019t weep for \u201cJumanji,\u201d however. The fantasy reboot, which finds Johnson, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart transported into a video game world, has outperformed expectations, picking up a lordly $66.5 million over the holiday weekend. It now has a hefty $185.7 million domestic gross and should continue to draw crowds in 2018. The \u201cJumanji\u201d sequel has also done well internationally, racking up $350 million worldwide, and has provided a much-needed hit for a studio that has struggled to keep pace with the Disney\u2019s and Warner Bros.\u2019s of the world. Sony claims the film has a $90 million budget. Those alleged production costs have raised eyebrows around town as to their veracity given the film\u2019s Hawaii location and starry cast, but regardless of creative accounting and aggressive spinning, the result is impressive. A sequel seems preordained.  \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d closed 2017 as the year\u2019s highest-grossing release and the seventh highest-grossing domestic movie of all time with $517.1 million. It will bypass its fellow franchisee \u201cRogue One\u201d at some point on New Year\u2019s Day to take the seventh spot on the stateside charts and has already blown past the $1 billion mark globally. The film carries a $200 million price tag, and has generated controversy for a series of creative decisions by director and writer Rian Johnson that have, depending on your perspective, either infused new energy into decades-old series or deviated dangerously from the Jedi canon.  It\u2019s been a dismal year for the domestic box office, which ends 2017 with $11.12 billion in sales, down 2.3% from last year\u2019s $11.38 billion and off slightly from 2015\u2019s $11.14 billion, according to comScore. After a bruising summer, when revenues plummeted more than 6% in the wake of costly flops such as \u201cThe Mummy\u201d and \u201cTransformer: The Last Knight,\u201d the gap did narrow. Fall and winter hits such as \u201cIt,\u201d \u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d \u201cCoco,\u201d and \u201cMurder on the Orient Express,\u201d helped make up the difference. The industry was also aided by record ticket prices. Empirically, fewer people made it to the multiplexes. Attendance is expected to hit a 27-year low when official numbers are tallied.  Universal\u2019s \u201cPitch Perfect 3\u201d took third place on the stateside charts, grossing $22.7 million for the four-day period and pushing its domestic total to just under $70 million. The a Cappella comedy carries a $45 million production budget and has been billed as the final installment in the franchise.  Hugh Jackman\u2019s musical drama \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d is finishing a close fourth with $20.7 million. The Fox-Chernin Entertainment production chronicles the rise of circus impresario P.T. Barnum. It got a boost from the holidays, and showed the biggest gain in the top 10 movies from the Christmas Eve weekend with an impressive 73% surge. The domestic total should hit $54.3 million through Monday. It\u2019s a pricey movie, though. All that singing and dancing didn\u2019t come cheap and \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d cost $84 million to make.  Fox\u2019s second weekend of \u201cFerdinand\u201d rounded out the top five with $14.6 million, giving the animated comedy $56.8 million domestically.  Not every film was feeling the holiday spirit. Paramount\u2019s \u201cDownsizing\u201d is a costly bomb. The comedy about a man (Matt Damon) who shrinks to the size of thimble in order to live in a materialistic utopia collapsed at the box office, eking out $6.1 million over the long weekend. Its total stands at $18.5 million \u2014 a paltry result given its $65 million budget. It also prolongs a box office losing streak for Damon. The actor also struck out with \u201cSuburbicon\u201d and \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d both of which opened during and flopped in 2017.  Warner Bros. and Alcon\u2019s comedy \u201cFather Figures\u201d was another casualty of the Christmas crunch. The story of two twin brothers (Ed Helms and Owen Wilson) on a quest to find their biological father netted $5.1 million over the four-day weekend. Its total tops out at $14.1 million, making it unlikely that it will recoup its $25 million production budget as well its marketing costs.  And Sony\u2019s \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d struggled to appeal to older audiences. The drama about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III attracted lots of attention for the filmmakers\u2019 last minute decision to re-cast a key role played by disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. The breakneck reshoots took place in a matter of weeks, with Christopher Plummer assuming the Spacey part as parsimonious billionaire J. Paul Getty, and added $10 million to the film\u2019s $40 million budget. Alas, audiences failed to show up. The movie grossed $7.5 million over the holiday weekend, bringing its domestic total to $14.7 million.  Foreign audiences picked up the slack as domestic attendance sputtered in 2017. The global box office is projected to hit $40 billion for the first time in history, propelled by the return of China. Total ticket sales in the Middle Kingdom grew by 22.3%, ending the year with $8.6 billion in revenues. That, at least, gives a beleaguered movie business some cause for celebration."

On Monday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was quoted by state media as apparently blaming Iran\u2019s arch enemies, the United States and Israel, for provoking unrest.  \u201cOur success in the political arena against the United States and the Zionist regime was unbearable to (Iran\u2019s enemies). Iran\u2019s success in the region was unbearable to them. Don\u2019t you expect that they would seek revenge? Don\u2019t you think they would provoke some people?\u201d Rouhani was quoted as saying in a meeting with lawmakers.  Netanyahu said Rouhani\u2019s suggestion that Israel was involved was \u201cnot only false \u2014 it\u2019s laughable\u201d.  Netanyahu added that more Western countries should condemn Tehran for trying to put down the protests.  \u201cSadly many European governments watch in silence as young heroic Iranians are beaten in the streets. That\u2019s just not right. And I, for one, will not stay silent,\u201d he said. (Reporting by Maayan Lubell and Dan Williams; Additional reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Peter Graff)"

          "body": "Jan 1 (Reuters) - A family of five from the New York City suburb of Scarsdale was aboard a plane that crashed into woodland off a popular tourist beach in Costa Rica on Sunday, killing all 12 people aboard, a family relative said.  Ten U.S. citizens and two Costa Rican pilots were killed when the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft crashed minutes after takeoff into a mountainous area off the beach town of Punta Islita, the Costa Rican government said. The town is in the province of Guanacaste, about 230 km (140 miles) west of the capital of San Jose.  The dead included the Steinberg family, consisting of a couple and their three sons.  \u201cWe are in utter shock and disbelief right now,\u201d Tamara Steinberg Jacobsen, the sister of the father, Bruce Steinberg, said on Facebook, where she posted pictures of the family and thanked people for their condolences.  \u201cThis will be our last post until we know further details. At this time we ask for privacy other than from immediate family and closest friends,\u201d she said in a subsequent post.  The family was identified as Bruce and Irene Steinberg and their sons William, Zachary and Matthew, The New York Times reported, citing relatives and a family friend.  Nature Air, the Costa Rican company that operated the flight, identified the five Steinbergs and five other passengers: Thibault Astruc, Amanda Geissler, Charles Palmer, Leslie Weiss and Sherry Wuu.  All 10 passengers were U.S. citizens, the State Department confirmed on Monday.  They all died along with Costa Rican pilots Juan Manuel Retana and Emma Ramos, Nature Air said.  Bruce Steinberg worked in investment banking and Irene Steinberg volunteered for many nonprofit groups, The Times said, citing a family friend, Lyn Kaller.  Matthew was an eighth-grader at a private school, William attended the University of Pennsylvania and Zachary was at Johns Hopkins University, the Times reported.  \u201cThey were a very loving, close family. They were devoted to their children. Any picture you see of them, it was full of smiles,\u201d Kaller was quoted as saying by The Journal News, which covers the Lower Hudson Valley area of New York state.  Reached by Reuters on Sunday, Kaller declined to comment.  Officials as of Sunday had yet to determine the cause of the crash, said Enio Cubillo, director of Costa Rica\u2019s civil aviation agency.  Punta Islita, on Costa Rica\u2019s Pacific Coast, is popular among North American and European tourists for its pristine beaches and lush landscape.

          "body": "* Palestinians hail teenager as hero  * Israelis differ on soldier\u2019s reaction  By Ali Sawafta  OFER PRISON, West Bank, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Israel indicted a 16-year-old Palestinian girl on Monday on charges including assault for punching an Israeli soldier in the face two weeks ago, an incident which made her into a hero for Palestinians and was seen as humiliating by right-wing Israelis.  Israel has held Ahed Tamimi since arresting her three days after she was filmed punching the soldier at the entrance to her family home in a village in the occupied West Bank. The confrontation took place after what Israel says was a stone-throwing assault on its troops.  The case has made her into such a symbol for Palestinians that a commentator in Israeli left-wing newspaper Haaretz said Israel risked turning her into the \u201cPalestinian Joan of Arc\u201d.  Right-wing Israelis, meanwhile, have debated whether the soldier had appeared weak by opting not to strike back. The Israeli army said he \u201cacted professionally\u201d by showing restraint.  The charge sheet against Tamimi, seen by Reuters, included counts of aggravated assault against a soldier, who the army said was bruised on his brow by her punch, obstructing a soldier in the performance of his duty and throwing stones at troops.  \u201cTamimi threw stones at them (the soldiers), threatened them, obstructed them in fulfilling their duty, took part in riots and incited others to take part in them,\u201d the military said on its public affairs Twitter account.  Tamimi\u2019s lawyer, Gaby Lasky, said she was certain some of the charges would eventually be dismissed, but nonetheless prosecutors may seek the maximum penalty for other counts.  \u201cI am sure they want to keep her as long as possible because they don\u2019t want the voice of resistance outside prison,\u201d Lasky told Reuters at the military courtroom in Ofer prison near the Palestinian city of Ramallah.  Tamimi was not asked to enter a plea at this stage. The military court gave her lawyer more time to study the charges.  An adult found guilty of assaulting a soldier could be jailed for up to 10 years, but such an outcome would be unlikely for Tamimi as a minor.  The incident occurred at the entrance to Tamimi\u2019s family home in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh, where weekly protests against Israeli settlement policy have been held for years. Tamimi\u2019s father is a prominent Palestinian activist.  Tamimi made news two years ago when she was pictured biting a soldier who tried to arrest her younger brother. In 2012 she was presented with an award in Turkey and met its president, Tayyip Erdogan, after images of her confronting an Israeli soldier went viral.

          "body": "BENGHAZI, Libya, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Libya\u2019s Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO) is hoping to resolve power problems by the end of March that are keeping production well below potential, its chairman said on Monday.  In recent weeks, AGOCO\u2019s production has been fluctuating between around 150,000 and 230,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to an oil source who asked not to be named. On Monday, production stood at 140,000 bpd, well below the more than 320,000 bpd AGOCO was producing in October.  AGOCO, a subsidiary of the National Oil Corporation (NOC), has continued to produce at a high rate from fields in eastern Libya while output from elsewhere in Libya has been hit by years of political turmoil and armed conflict.  But it has suffered from power supply problems and \u2014 like other operators in the North African OPEC member \u2014 funding shortfalls for its operating budget and a lack of investment.  Libya\u2019s national output has been hovering around 1 million bpd since June, about four times mid-2016 levels. Along with Nigeria, Libya was exempted from OPEC-led output cuts that were extended in November.  AGOCO Chairman Mohamed Shatwan said many wells were shut because of ageing infrastructure and a lack of power in a number of fields, including the giant Sarir field.  \u201cSarir field covers an area of more than 500 sq km so it needs converter stations and transformers,\u201d to ensure power supply, Shatwan told Reuters in an interview.  Two new fixed turbines were brought to Sarir in 2014 to replace turbines from the 1960s but are still awaiting assembly, a process that will take up to a year and a half, he said.  \u201cWe bought three other mobile turbines of 5 megawatts each, so 15 MW, in order to resolve the power problem until the others are installed.\u201d  He declined to specify AGOCO\u2019s current or future output levels.  Another major problem for AGOCO is its gas compressors in Nafoura field, which also date from the 1960s. \u201cSome of them are no longer manufactured and spare parts are not available,\u201d Shatwan said.  \u201cThe ageing equipment and lack of spare parts of course contributes to stoppages at existing power plants in the fields, and the power plant stoppages lower production.  \u201cBut from the plan we have been putting in place for years, we expect to overcome our electricity problems in the first quarter of 2018, by the end of March.\u201d (Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Kevin Liffey)"

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian authorities are treading cautiously in the face of mass protests, eager to take control but worried a crackdown could plunge the country into a crisis similar to the pro-reform unrest of 2009.  In June that year as Iranians seethed across the nation, a video showing protester Neda Agha-Soltan\u2019s last moments after being shot in the chest made her an icon of the opposition movement.  This time, Iranian moderates are appealing for caution even though some hardliners are calling for an iron fist to crush one of the gravest threats to Iran\u2019s clerical leaders, who came to power in the 1979 Islamic revolution.  Those divisions are making it hard for the authorities to defuse spontaneous demonstration, especially as there are no apparent protest leaders who can be identified and rounded up.  Videos on the internet showed the difficulties the Iranian authorities are facing in controlling the protests, in contrast to 2009 when the opposition had a clear hierarchy.  Footage carried on several semi-official websites showed men in white hooded coats who were described as the protest leaders. Red arrows on the screen identified them as they led attacks on police and buildings.  In 2009, the \u201cGreen Movement\u201d accused of stoking months of mass protests had two clear figureheads. Both have been under house arrest since 2011 though neither has been formally charged or appeared in court.  The latest unrest began on Thursday when hundreds of people took to the streets of Iran\u2019s second city Mashhad to protest against economic hardships and alleged corruption.  But in a rare political challenge, they were soon calling for clerical leaders including the ultimate authority in Iran\u2019s cumbersome system of dual clerical and republican rule - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - to step down.  Since Thursday, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets across Iran, alarming the government and the clerical leadership.  Ten people were killed during protests on Sunday, state television reported, as unsigned statements posted on social media sites called for new demonstrations in the capital Tehran and 50 other cities.  In a ratcheting up of tensions, protesters tried to take over some military bases and police stations but were pushed back by security forces, state TV said without elaborating.   President Hassan Rouhani struck a conciliatory tone as demonstrators widened their targets from police vehicles and banks to seminaries in a direct challenge to the country\u2019s religious establishment.   \u201cWhat has happened in the past few days may appear as a threat but we have to turn it into an opportunity and see what the problem is,\u201d ISNA news agency quoted Rouhani as saying on Sunday.  He even contradicted the usual conspiracy theories that blame Western powers and Israel for Iran\u2019s woes, stressing the need to get to the root causes of the problem.  \u201cAll these people are not getting orders from abroad, and some have gone out to the streets because of their feelings and problems,\u201d he said.  Lawmaker Jorjik Abramian was also measured in his response to growing frustrations with unemployment that hit 28.8 percent last year and alleged graft that prompted some Iranians to describe their government as thieves.  \u201cThe recent events are due to an accumulation of people\u2019s demands that have been ignored,\u201d ILNA news agency quoted him as saying. \u201cWe must restore the trust of the people in the authorities. If this happens, no foreign agent can carry out his aims in the country.\u201d  The 2009 protests following the disputed re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were eventually crushed by the state security apparatus, headed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its affiliated Basij militia volunteers.  ILNA said Abramian warned against any \u201crepeat of Kahrizak\u201d -a reference to an infamous detention center outside Tehran where three detainees were killed and many tortured in 2009, according to human rights campaigners.  Protesters, for their part, also don\u2019t seem to have a clear plan, other than defying the security forces and even the elite Revolutionary Guards.  The security forces may be showing restraint this time to avoid bloodshed that could galvanize and embolden protesters. But that has not stopped leading conservatives calling for tough measures.   \u201cThose who commit sabotage and spread unrest should be dealt with and dealt with firmly,\u201d judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani said in remarks carried on state television.  With few options at hand, some Iranian leaders lashed out again at the United States. A top military official said support for the protesters expressed by U.S. President Trump and other U.S. officials showed Washington had ulterior motives.  \u201cThe involvement of top U.S. leaders along with other states and media outlets ... suggest that America is planning to launch a new sedition in Iran,\u201d armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, was quoted as saying by the state broadcaster IRIB\u2019s website.  But that has failed so far to divert the attention of Iranians away from their problems at home.  Iran\u2019s leaders believe they can count on support from many of the generation that took part in the 1979 revolution because of their ideological commitment and the economic gains they have made under the Islamic government, analysts say.  But the growing number of youths taking to the streets suggests the old guard may have to compromise and give in to some of their demands, analysts say.

In March, the U.S. government awarded a contract to AT&T to build the network, years after a federal commission recommended setting up such a system following the 9/11 attacks.  The No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier will receive 20 megahertz of wireless airwaves and success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years as part of the project known as FirstNet. AT&T expects to spend about $40 billion over 25 years to build and maintain the network.  States had until Thursday to opt out of AT&T\u2019s network and build their own public safety networks. In addition to the states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands also opted for FirstNet, AT&T said. Decisions from the three Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam and Northern Mariana Islands are not due until March 12, 2018.   Wall Street analysts have said FirstNet is a way for AT&T to add to its portfolio of wireless airwaves, or spectrum, at a time when consumers are using more data on their cell phones.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intrepid revelers from around the world endured hours of waiting in a frigid Times Square on Sunday to witness the glittering  New Year\u2019s Eve ball make its annual descent at midnight, undeterred and perhaps reassured by a massive police presence.  With New York City in the grip of a bitterly cold Arctic air mass, the experience was made particularly memorable this year for hundreds of thousands of people who braved the bone-chilling conditions to witness a century-old tradition.    In the waning hours of 2017, the mercury had plunged to 10 Fahrenheit, with a \u201cReal Feel\u201d of 7F, according to AccuWeather.com. That made it the city\u2019s second-coldest New Year\u2019s Eve on record after 1917, when the mercury in Times Square dropped to 1F (-17C).  Jaden Hunter, a 13-year-old from southern New Jersey, arrived at around 6 p.m., protected by a face mask and geared up for a good time.  \u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty chilly, but we\u2019ve got hand-warmers and all kinds of thermal technology.\u201d  About 2 million people were expected in the vicinity of Times Square, the bow-tie-shaped plaza formed by the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue in midtown Manhattan. That was roughly same number as last year, when the temperature at midnight was a comfortable 44F (7C).  Still, the weather was severe enough to test the mettle of even the hardiest of partygoers.  Alejandro Garcia, 32, of Barcelona, Spain, said the only thing that stood between him and leaving early for a warm hotel room was his girlfriend, graduate student Gamma Elias, 28.  \u201cI\u2019m freezing to death out here!\u201d Garcia said, a few hours before midnight, wrapping his arms around Elias. \u201cBut she wants to stay.\u201d  Like tens of thousands of others, the couple stood in one of dozens of fenced-in enclosures set up for blocks along the square. After hours of waiting, they were rewarded with a spectacular view of the giant ball as it made its annual, one-minute descent on the southern end of the plaza.   Greg Packer, 54, a retired highway maintenance manager from Huntington, New York, had a prime spot on West 43rd Street after arriving at 7 a.m.  \u201cIt feels more like Antarctica than New York. But everybody in the world is here,\u201d he marveled, glancing around at the crowds in nearly every direction. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here.\u201d  The crowds counted down the final hours of 2017 with a lineup of live musical acts including Nick Jonas, Neil Diamond and Andy Grammer.  Mariah Carey returned to the Times Square stage as well, pulling off a smooth performance after the embarrassment of last year\u2019s technical difficulties.  Then came the long-awaited ball drop, a tradition that dates to 1907, three years after New Yorkers started gathering en masse in Times Square to usher in the new year.   Thousands of police were on hand, some heavily armed, others undercover. The show of force is part of a beefed-up security plan that follows a spate of attacks in the city and around the world that authorities have labeled as terrorist.   The NYPD provided officers with specialized training to stop any suicide bombers in response to an attempted bombing in a Times Square subway station walkway on Dec. 11.  Police deployed observation teams trained to spot snipers. There were also more explosive-detecting dogs and more officers positioned throughout the area this year.  People hoping to see musical acts and other entertainment up close in Times Square had to pass by heavily armed officers and dogs. They went through a magnetometer to check for weapons, had their bags inspected, then repeated all those steps a second time.  Police cars, dump trucks filled with sand and cement blocks were used to close streets, starting Sunday morning. About 125 parking garages in the area were emptied of all cars and sealed.  Brynn Hansen, 14, from Longmont, Colorado, appeared unfazed by the heightened security and the trying conditions. She said she was living a dream.  \u201cIt\u2019s been on my bucket list, and now I can cross it off. It\u2019s exciting to be here.\u201d  Additional reporting by Gina Cherelus; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by Dave Gregorio and Michael Perry"

Ayoub, who was previously chief of staff in the army, is a member of Assad\u2019s Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi\u2019ite Islam. He replaces Fahad Jassim al-Freij.   The new information minister, Sarah, was previously the head of Syria radio and television.   Changes of senior ministers are not unusual in Syria. The shake-up of senior military positions comes after a year of battlefield victories against anti-Assad rebels and Islamic State.   Assad now appears militarily unassailable, but relies heavily on his allies Russia and Iran, as well as regional militias backed by Iran. Some important parts of Syria remain out of his hands and the economy has been crippled by sanctions.   Russia is pushing a diplomatic track to seek a political settlement to the war.

          "body": "PARIS, Jan 1 (Reuters) - New passenger car registrations in France rose 4.74 percent to more than two million vehicles in 2017 but the share of new diesel cars fell below 50 percent for the first time since 2000, industry data showed on Monday.  December registrations fell 0.51 percent to 193,375 vehicles and total 2017 registrations added up to 2,110,751 passenger cars, back to the level of about two million new cars that was usual before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, French car makers\u2019 association CCFA said in a statement.  In 2008, 2.05 million new cars were registered.  Registrations jumped to about 2.2 million units per year in the three years following the crisis due to government incentives for car purchases, but fell back to less than 1.8 million units as the incentives were dropped.  The number of new registrations grew by 5.1 percent in 2016 and by 6.8 percent in 2015, ending five years of flat or lower car sales. For 2018, analysts at L\u2019Observatoire de l\u2019Automobile expect registrations to grow 3.8 percent to 2.2 million.  Diesel-engine cars - which made up three quarters of all French car sales five years ago - made up just 47.29 percent of new registrations last year, from 52 percent in 2016.  Following the Volkswagen \u201cdieselgate\u201d emissions scandal in 2015, many cities and countries have imposed limits or bans on polluting diesel engines.  Electric vehicles made up 1.18 percent of new registrations in France last year, hybrids 3.8 percent.  French car manufacturers had a 54.5 percent market share last year, up from 53.5 percent in 2016. The PSA group (Peugeot, Citroen) had 29.2 percent share and the Renault group a 25.3 percent share.  Among foreign brands, the Volkswagen group (Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche and other brands) had a 12.4 percent market share, followed by Toyota-Lexus with 4.46 percent and the Fiat group (Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Jeep) with 4.23 percent.

Murray, who has struggled with a persistent hip injury since a quarter-final exit at Wimbledon in July last year, pulled out of the U.S. Open and dropped to 16th in the world rankings.  \u201cI\u2019ll probably make some changes to my schedule this year,\u201d Murray, who will participate in the Brisbane International, told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly play less than I have in the past to give my body time to rest and recover.  \u201cI would want to play as long as I could physically do it, and most of the players would feel the same way... giving yourself breaks, especially as you get older, is very important and something that I\u2019ll certainly be looking to do.\u201d  Murray returned to action in an exhibition match against Roberto Bautista Agut last Friday and is confident his hip has healed sufficiently to allow him to compete at the top level.  \u201cMy hip feels way better than it did at Wimbledon,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Wimbledon, I almost made the semi-finals... So if it\u2019s better than that, then that\u2019s positive.  \u201cBut playing the matches and getting used to that intensity again and how you recover from a match is what is important.

Kerber put Germany ahead with a hard-fought 7-6(6) 7-6(1) victory over Mertens in the round robin stage of the eight-nation mixed team event.  David Goffin helped Belgium get back into the contest with a clinical 6-3 6-3 win over world number four Zverev to leave the tie at 1-1. But Kerber and Zverev were too strong for their rivals in the deciding mixed doubles rubber, winning 4-2 4-3.  Kerber started her singles match slowly, conceded an early break but fought back to claim three games in a row. She saved a set point at 5-6 and then forced a tiebreak which she won with a crisp backhand winner.

          "body": "(Adds details, analysis)  By Andrew Torchia  DUBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Oman\u2019s state budget for 2018, approved by ruler Sultan Qaboos on Monday, boosts spending at the expense of running a large deficit, despite increasing concern among credit rating agencies about the health of the country\u2019s finances.  The budget projects spending of 12.5 billion rials ($32.5 billion) this year, up from 11.7 billion in the original budget for 2017, local media quoted a Finance Ministry statement as saying.  Revenue are projected at 9.5 billion rials, up from 8.7 billion in the 2017 budget. That leaves a planned deficit of 3 billion rials this year, the same as last year\u2019s projected deficit.  The 2018 budget assumes an average oil price of $50 per barrel, up from an assumption of $45 for 2017. The Brent oil price is now above $65, so Oman\u2019s revenue is likely to be significantly higher than expected if oil prices stay flat.  Nevertheless, the budget projects a deficit of 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2018, well above levels which economists consider sustainable in the long run and higher than 12 percent planned for 2017.  The finance ministry said on Monday that it needed to continue raising expenditure to boost economic growth and living standards, while building social housing and providing other assistance to lower-income citizens.  With smaller oil and financial reserves than its wealthy neighbours, Oman has been spending heavily on industrial and infrastructure projects in an attempt to diversify its economy beyond oil exports.  That strategy has not reassured rating agencies. Last month, Fitch Ratings cut Oman by one notch to BBB-minus - just above junk territory - with a negative outlook, citing the budget deficit. Standard & Poor\u2019s already rates Omani debt as junk.  Of the projected 3 billion rial deficit in 2018, 500 million rials is to be covered by withdrawals from financial reserves and the rest through external and domestic borrowing.  Oman\u2019s actual state budget deficit for the first 10 months of 2017 narrowed to 3.20 billion rials from 4.81 billion rials a year earlier, the latest finance ministry data showed.  Finance ministry sources told local media last week that Oman would delay the introduction of a 5 percent value-added tax until 2019, instead of imposing it in 2018 as originally planned, to give tax administrators and companies more time to prepare. However, Oman will impose a new tax on sugary drinks and tobacco products by mid-2018.  The ministry said on Monday that it would proceed with a privatisation programme and was working to sell some state companies in 2018.  The government announced several years ago that it would launch a major privatisation scheme but there has been little progress since.

          "body": "* Gasoline hike came sooner than some had expected  * May combine with VAT introduction to hit consumption  * Saudi Public Transport shares rise, Budget Saudi falls  * Telecommunications firm Mobily jumps  * Other major regional bourses closed for holidays  By Andrew Torchia  DUBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia\u2019s stock market fell on Monday after the government sharply raised domestic gasoline prices, a step that will help to cut its budget deficit but will also crimp consumers\u2019 purchasing power.  The Saudi stock index dropped 0.5 percent in active trade as real estate firm Dar Al Arkan, the most heavily traded stock, plunged 10 percent. It had more than doubled in price in the last quarter of 2017.  Bus operator Saudi Public Transport Co, which could benefit if driving of private cars is curbed by higher gasoline prices, gained 3.6 percent. Car rental company Budget Saudi fell 2.6 percent.  Telecommunications firm Mobily was a big gainer, jumping 8.6 percent in its heaviest trade since October 2015.  The energy ministry had already indicated that it would announce in the first quarter of this year a rise in gasoline prices, but the rise came earlier than some people had expected.  Some had expected authorities to wait to gauge the blow to consumption from the introduction of a 5 percent value-added tax at the start of this year. Together, the tax and higher gasoline prices could affect consumption significantly, although Riyadh is also introducing a system of cash handouts to lower- and middle-income households to soften the pain of reforms.  The price of Octane 91 gasoline rose to 1.37 riyals (37 U.S. cents) a litre from 0.75 riyal, while Octane 95 rose to 2.04 riyals from 0.90 riyal. Diesel rates for trucks were left unchanged. Saudi Arabia\u2019s gasoline prices will still be among the lowest in the world.  Other major Middle Eastern stock markets were closed for New Year holidays on Monday. (Editing by Peter Graff)"

          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - After a year that saw democracy advocates in Hong Kong jailed and ousted from public office, thousands marched through the streets of Hong Kong on New Year\u2019s Day to warn China not to meddle further in the city\u2019s affairs and undermine its autonomy.  Over the past year, Hong Kong, a former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, has experienced what critics and pro-democracy activists describe as an intensifying assault on its autonomy by China\u2019s Communist Party leaders.  This is despite Beijing\u2019s promises to grant the city wide-ranging freedoms including an independent judiciary, under a so-called \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework.  Besides the controversial jailing of several prominent young activists for unlawful assembly over the massive 2014 \u201cOccupy\u201d pro-democracy protests, authorities also ejected six pro-democracy lawmakers from the legislature for failing to take proper oaths of office.  The city\u2019s reputation as one of Asia\u2019s most robust legal jurisdictions has also come under a cloud amidst accusations of a politicization of certain legal cases.   The protesters, who included many middle-aged and elderly citizens, held up banners and chanted the march\u2019s main theme to \u201cProtect Hong Kong\u201d during a walk of several kilometers to the city\u2019s government headquarters.   Others decried an unprecedented move by China\u2019s parliament last week that said part of a high-speed railway station being built in Hong Kong would be regarded as mainland territory governed by mainland laws.  \u201cWe are here to tell the government that we will not give up,\u201d said Joshua Wong, one of the democracy activists jailed last year, but who is now out on bail pending an appeal.  \u201cWe have encountered many difficulties last year, including some of us being sued and jailed, but we will stand with Hong Kong people. We will fight for the rule of law, fight for Hong Kong, fight for the future, fight for the next generations.\u201d  Two protesters who dressed up as People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers said they were concerned about the reach of China\u2019s security apparatus. Others called for full democracy as the only lasting means to safeguard the city\u2019s way of life.   The organizers of the march said some 10,000 people had showed up. Police, however, put the figure at 6,200.  The demonstration was largely peaceful, though some protesters who tried to later gather in a forecourt of the government\u2019s headquarters skirmished briefly with security guards.  The so-called \u201cCivic Square\u201d was where the 2014 pro-democracy protests first kicked off when a group of protesters stormed over a fence and faced off with local police.  Despite the defiance on show, some said they feared Hong Kong would continue to be squeezed by Beijing.  \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing what they can,\u201d said Andy Lau who was among the marchers. \u201cIf we have the right to demonstrate then we should. But I\u2019m not feeling positive. I think things will get worse.\u201d   The Hong Kong government, in a statement, said it \u201cfully respects the right of Hong Kong people to take part in processions and their freedom of expression\u201d.  China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping has said that while Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy under \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, Beijing still holds supreme authority over the city and won\u2019t tolerate any challenge to its authority.

Richard Cousins, 58, chief of the world\u2019s biggest catering firm, died together with Emma Bowden, 48, Heather Bowden, 11, Edward Cousins, 23, and William Cousins, 25, according to Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings of the New South Wales Police.  Australian media identified the dead as the CEO\u2019s two sons, his fiancee and her daughter. The pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, also died.   Cousins had been due to retire on March 31.   Compass said the new chief executive, Dominic Blakemore, would now start on Jan. 1 instead of April 1 as originally planned.     Compass, with annual turnover of almost 23 billion pounds  ($31 billion), employs around 550,000 people around the world providing food services to schools, the armed forces and office workers.  Blakemore, who has worked at Compass since 2012 with roles as both finance director and head of the group\u2019s European operations, has a background in accounting. He has also held senior financial roles at British food groups Cadbury and Birds Eye Iglo.   Compass Chairman Paul Walsh said in a statement: \u201cThe thoughts of everyone at Compass are with Richard\u2019s family and friends, and we extend our deepest sympathies to them.\u201d   \u201cRichard was known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain\u2019s leading companies,\u201d he added.

He joined Tesco (TSCO.L) as an independent director in 2014 at the height of the British supermarket chain\u2019s accounting scandal, stepping down from that role at the start of 2017.  The family are believed to have been flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay when the plane crashed, the BBC reported.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California will launch the world\u2019s largest regulated commercial market for recreational marijuana on Monday, as dozens of newly licensed stores catering to adults who enjoy the drug for its psychoactive effects open for business up and down the state.  It becomes the sixth U.S. state, and by far the most populous, venturing beyond legalized medical marijuana to permit the sale of cannabis products of all types to customers at least 21 years old.  Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Nevada were the first to introduce recreational pot sales on a state-regulated, licensed and taxed basis. Massachusetts and Maine are on track to follow suit later this year.  With California and its 39.5 million residents officially joining the pack, more than one-in-five Americans now live in states where recreational marijuana is legal for purchase, even though cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under U.S. law.  The marijuana market in California alone, which boasts the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy, is valued by most experts at several billion dollars annually and is expected to generate at least a $1 billion a year in tax revenue.  \u201cAdding California to the regulated [recreational] market for cannabis is a really big deal,\u201d said Heather Azzi, a senior attorney for the Marijuana Policy Project, an advocacy group working to liberalize marijuana laws.  Uruguay became the first and only country to legalize recreational marijuana sales nationally, permitted through its pharmacies starting in July 2017, but is far smaller in comparison, with a population of just 3.4 million.  Still, most California jurisdictions are sitting out the highly anticipated New Year\u2019s Day inauguration of recreational cannabis sales.  Many, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, will not be ready for days or weeks because of additional red tape required by city and county governments before would-be retailers can obtain their state licenses.  But business will almost certainly be brisk at newly permitted shops ready on Day One. They number about four-dozen outlets across California, according to an authoritative guide to the cannabis market, GreenState, published by the San Francisco Chronicle.  Stores authorized to carry recreational weed were set to go on New Year\u2019s Day in San Diego, San Jose, Santa Cruz, Oakland, Berkeley, Eureka and Desert Hot Springs, among other locales. Hundreds more are expected to open throughout the state as the year progresses.  Many previously operated strictly as medical cannabis dispensaries under a patchwork of local regulations, and will now be licensed by the state for recreational merchandise as well.  Among the very first will be the Oakland-based Harborside dispensary, which has long ranked as the largest U.S. medical marijuana outlet. It planned to opens its doors at 6 a.m. local time on Monday.  Customers in the recreational sector - which state regulators prefer to call the \u201cadult use\u201d market - are only permitted to buy an ounce (28 grams) of raw cannabis or its equivalent at a time.  Medical patients can buy unlimited quantities, but must present a doctor\u2019s note and have purchased a medical ID card.  The stage for Monday\u2019s grand opening was set when voters passed a ballot measure in November 2016, Proposition 64, immediately legalizing personal possession and use of recreational pot by adults 21 and over.  But it has taken California lawmakers and bureaucrats over a year to devise a licensing, regulatory and tax structure for all phases of the commercial distribution chain.  California in 1996 became the first state to legalize marijuana for medical use, and more than 30 states have since done likewise.   Reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Kim Coghill"

          "body": "MANILA (Reuters) - Five fire officials being questioned over a blaze that led to the deaths of 37 staff at the southern Philippines offices of an American market research firm have been relieved of their duties, a government investigator said on Monday.   The Dec. 23 blaze in Davao City broke out at a furniture and fabric store on the third level of a mall, the New City Commercial Center (NCCC), and then engulfed the offices of the U.S. firm, Research Now SSI, on the fourth floor of the same building in choking smoke.  The only person among the 38 killed in the fire who did not work at the firm was a mall security officer. More than 100 SSI employees who were on duty that day managed to escape, of whom six were injured.  Initial findings from a probe showed Leo Lauzon, fire safety inspector of SSI Office, Joel Quizmundo, fire safety inspector of the NCCC Mall, Roger Dumag, chief of the fire safety section of SIR fire station, and Renero Jimenez, station commander of SIR fire station have \u201csome liabilities\u201d, said Senior Superintendent Jerry Candido, one of the lead investigators.  SIR fire station has jurisdiction over the NCCC mall.  All four were relieved of their duties, Candido told Reuters over phone. A fifth official, Honee Fritz Alagano - Davao City fire marshal and spokeswoman for the Bureau of Fire Protection in the city - has also been relieved of command, he added.  \u201cThey were relieved because they are the subject of an investigation and of course to avoid influencing any witnesses in the investigation and possible tampering of documents within their custody,\u201d said Candido, who is also director of logistics at the Philippines\u2019 Bureau of Fire Protection.  Candido earlier said there were indications of fire safety lapses that may have contributed to the tragedy.  The NCCC mall had been issued a fire safety inspection certificate in April 2017, a requirement for its yearly business permit renewal, Candido said, adding investigators would look into whether any questions were raised when it was granted the certificate last year and in previous years.   \u201cWhen we conducted a verification inspection (after the fire), we found out there exists several violations of the fire code in the building,\u201d he said. There are problems with \u201cexits, sprinkler systems and alarm systems\u201d.   Darry Gallego, assistant vice president of corporate services at the NCCC, has said the mall could not comment on an ongoing investigation, but stressed that safety requirements had been met, including having a sprinkler system.  Barbara Palmer, SSI\u2019s senior vice president for global marketing, said in an email response to a series of Reuters\u2019 questions about fire safety at its Davao offices that the firm could not address them specifically while the probe was ongoing.

The Dec. 23 blaze in Davao City broke out at a furniture and fabric store on the third level of a mall, the New City Commercial Center (NCCC), and then engulfed the offices of the U.S. firm, Research Now SSI, on the fourth floor of the same building in choking smoke.  The only person among the 38 killed in the fire who did not work at the firm was a mall security officer. More than 100 SSI employees who were on duty that day managed to escape, of whom six were injured.  Initial findings from a probe showed Leo Lauzon, fire safety inspector of SSI Office, Joel Quizmundo, fire safety inspector of the NCCC Mall, Roger Dumag, chief of the fire safety section of SIR fire station, and Renero Jimenez, station commander of SIR fire station have \u201csome liabilities\u201d, said Senior Superintendent Jerry Candido, one of the lead investigators.  SIR fire station has jurisdiction over the NCCC mall.  All four were relieved of their duties, Candido told Reuters over phone. A fifth official, Honee Fritz Alagano - Davao City fire marshal and spokeswoman for the Bureau of Fire Protection in the city - has also been relieved of command, he added.  \u201cThey were relieved because they are the subject of an investigation and of course to avoid influencing any witnesses in the investigation and possible tampering of documents within their custody,\u201d said Candido, who is also director of logistics at the Philippines\u2019 Bureau of Fire Protection.  Candido earlier said there were indications of fire safety lapses that may have contributed to the tragedy.  The NCCC mall had been issued a fire safety inspection certificate in April 2017, a requirement for its yearly business permit renewal, Candido said, adding investigators would look into whether any questions were raised when it was granted the certificate last year and in previous years.   \u201cWhen we conducted a verification inspection (after the fire), we found out there exists several violations of the fire code in the building,\u201d he said. There are problems with \u201cexits, sprinkler systems and alarm systems\u201d.   Darry Gallego, assistant vice president of corporate services at the NCCC, has said the mall could not comment on an ongoing investigation, but stressed that safety requirements had been met, including having a sprinkler system.  Barbara Palmer, SSI\u2019s senior vice president for global marketing, said in an email response to a series of Reuters\u2019 questions about fire safety at its Davao offices that the firm could not address them specifically while the probe was ongoing.

Four days of demonstrations in Iran have posed the boldest challenge to its clerical leadership since pro-reform unrest in 2009. At least four people have been killed as some confrontations with police turned violent.  \u201cI can only wish success to the Iranian people in the struggle for freedom and democracy,\u201d Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said in an Army Radio interview.  \u201cIf the people succeed in achieving freedom and democracy, many of the threats on Israel and the entire region today will disappear.\u201d  Israel has long voiced alarm over the Shi\u2019ite power\u2019s nuclear programme and its support for Islamist guerrillas in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories - concerns shared by Sunni Arab states.  Asked why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s example in offering more open endorsement for the protesters, Katz said: \u201cIsrael has undertaken not to get involved in this internal affair\u201d.  Trump\u2019s tough approach to Tehran, which has included the threat of U.S. sanctions, had disrupted the Iranian government\u2019s \u201cillusion of economic betterment\u201d, he said.  On Sunday, an Iranian official blamed \u201cforeign agents\u201d for a clash in which two protesters were killed.

The two were killed on Sunday in the southwestern town of Izeh and several others were injured, ILNA news agency quoted local member of parliament Hedayatollah Khademi as saying.  \u201cI do not know whether yesterday\u2019s shooting was done by rally participants or the police and this issue is being investigated,\u201d Khademi was quoted as saying.  Messages on social media urged Iranians to hold rallies in the capital Tehran and 50 other urban centres, many of which have already seen four days of unrest since price protests in the second largest city Mashhad on Thursday turned political.  Protests continued overnight even though President Hassan Rouhani appealed for calm. He said Iranians had the right to criticise authorities but warned of a crackdown against unrest.  \u201cThe government will show no tolerance for those who damage public properties, violate public order and create unrest in the society,\u201d Rouhani said in remarks carried by state TV.  Tens of thousands of people have protested across the country against the Islamic Republic\u2019s government and clerical elite, prompting authorities to warn of a tough crackdown.  Security forces have showed restraint, hoping to avoid and escalation of the crisis triggered by economic hardships and corruption. Anger soon turned to Iran\u2019s clerical establishment in power since the 1979 revolution.

Figures from Macau\u2019s Gaming Inspection and Coordination bureau on Monday showed revenues rose 19 percent for 2017 to 265.7 billion patacas ($33.13 billion).  Analysts had expected 2017 full-year growth of 18-20 percent to $33 billion to $34 billion.  The former Portuguese colony and now special administrative region is clambering back after revenue plunged to five-year lows in 2014.  But revenue is still far off the highs hit ahead of 2014, hovering only around monthly tolls seen in 2011, data from Thomson Reuters Datastream showed.  Monthly gambling revenue in December was up 15 percent to 22.7 billion patacas, slightly lower than analysts\u2019 expectations for growth of 17-20 percent.  Winnings have been higher for operators such as Sands China Ltd (1928.HK), Wynn Macau Ltd (1128.HK), Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd (0027.HK) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd (MLCO.O) which have casinos on the Cotai strip - a stretch of reclaimed land which now boasts some of Macau\u2019s most opulent properties.  SJM Holdings Ltd (0880.HK) and MGM China Holdings Ltd (2282.HK), which do not yet have a presence on Cotai, have seen market share erode ahead of new openings along the strip.

          "body": "SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A Costa Rican plane crashed into woodland off a popular tourist beach on Sunday, killing 10 U.S. citizens and two local pilots, the Costa Rican government said.  The accident occurred in the mountainous area off the Punta Islita beach town in the province of Guanacaste, about 230 km (140 miles) west of the capital of San Jose.   Enio Cubillo, director of Costa Rica\u2019s civil aviation agency, said the Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft operated by local company Nature Air had crashed minutes after take-off, but that officials had not yet determined the cause of the crash.  The plane had passed a safety inspection about a month ago and was authorized to fly, Cubillo said. Although strong winds in the morning had forced the pilots to alter their itinerary, they had flown safely to Punto Islita to pick up passengers headed to San Jose.  Nature Air said in a statement that it lamented the accident, without explaining the cause. The flight was part of a special charter service for 20 people, relying on two planes. The first plane, carrying 10 passengers, arrived safely in San Jose at 11:40 a.m. The second, with 10 passengers and two pilots, departed 20 minutes later.    \u201cRegrettably this plane crashed a few minutes after taking off,\u201d Nature Air said.   A video of the crash site obtained from Costa Rica\u2019s Security Ministry shows orange flames consuming a pile of blackened ruins, with plane parts scattered in an area thick with trees.  Laura Chinchilla, who was president of Costa Rica from 2010 to 2014, said on Twitter that her cousin, one of the pilots, had died in the accident.   A U.S. State Department official confirmed that multiple U.S. citizens had died, but said the agency would not provide further details out of respect for the affected families.   \u201cThere are no people alive,\u201d Costa Rica\u2019s Security Minister Gustavo Mata said, adding that autopsies would be needed to confirm the total number and identities of victims because their remains were badly burned.   Punta Islita, on Costa Rica\u2019s Pacific Coast, is popular among North American and European tourists for its pristine beaches and lush landscape.

          "body": "Gaming revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau rose for the first time in three years in 2017 as high-end punters\u2019 appetite  for gambling recovers after a protracted government campaign against shows of wealth among public officials and slowing economic growth.  Figures from Macau\u2019s Gaming Inspection and Coordination bureau on Monday showed revenues rose 19 percent for 2017 to 265.7 billion patacas ($33.13 billion).  Analysts had expected 2017 full-year growth of 18-20 percent to $33 billion to $34 billion.  The former Portuguese colony and now special administrative region is clambering back after revenue plunged to five-year lows in 2014.  But revenue is still far off the highs hit ahead of 2014, hovering only around monthly tolls seen in 2011, data from Thomson Reuters Datastream showed.  Monthly gambling revenue in December was up 15 percent to 22.7 billion patacas, slightly lower than analysts\u2019 expectations for growth of 17-20 percent.  Winnings have been higher for operators such as Sands China Ltd (1928.HK), Wynn Macau Ltd (1128.HK), Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd (0027.HK) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd (MLCO.O) which have casinos on the Cotai strip - a stretch of reclaimed land which now boasts some of Macau\u2019s most opulent properties.  SJM Holdings Ltd (0880.HK) and MGM China Holdings Ltd (2282.HK), which do not yet have a presence on Cotai, have seen market share erode ahead of new openings along the strip.  MGM is due to open its new resort in January 2018 while SJM is not expected to open until closer to 2019, analysts said.  Reporting by Farah Master; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Kim Coghill"

The 27-year-old Czech was unable to take the court in her first round match against Estonian Anett Kontaveit and was replaced in the draw by lucky loser Heather Watson.  \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed to withdraw from the Brisbane International,\u201d Kvitova was quoted as saying on the WTA website.  \u201cUnfortunately I picked up a virus on the flight to Australia and I haven\u2019t been able to get healthy in time to play here.   \u201cIt\u2019s always a fantastic and competitive place to start the year so I\u2019m sorry not to be in the draw.\u201d  The former world number two required four hours of surgery on her left hand in December 2016 after being attacked by a man wielding a knife who had gained access to her apartment by posing as a utility worker.  Kvitova returned to action, after months of rehabilitation, during the French Open in May and went on to win the Aegon Classic in June.

Simmons scored nine straight points for Philadelphia during a stretch in the fourth quarter, and JJ Redick hit a 3-pointer off an assist from Simmons that gave the 76ers a 119-108 lead with 1:31 to play.  Simmons finished with 21 points, nine rebounds and six assists, and Joel Embiid added 22 points, nine rebounds and five assists for Philadelphia. Embiid was injured in the fourth quarter and left the arena with his hand iced and bandaged.  \u201cThey said it wasn\u2019t broken. They think it was sprained, so I guess that\u2019s good news,\u201d Embiid said.  Saric made 9 of 13 shots and four of his five 3-point tries.  The 76ers (17-19) built a big first-half lead and withstood a second-half barrage from the Suns\u2019 Devin Booker and T.J. Warren to survive. The win caps a 3-2 road trip for the Sixers, who will return home for first time since Dec. 15 to host the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.  Booker, in his second game back after missing three weeks with a strained left adductor, scored 32 points for the Suns (14-24). Warren finished with 28 points.  The 76ers separated themselves from the Suns in the second quarter. They led by 18, 53-35, after Jerryd Bayless\u2019 layup with six minutes left in the first half.  Redick hit a pull-up jumper, and Simmons had a dunk in the final two minutes, sending Philadelphia to halftime with a comfortable 63-49 lead.  Booker got hot in the third quarter, scoring 11 points in the first five minutes after halftime and getting the Suns back in the game. He had 16 in the quarter to fuel the Phoenix comeback.  Warren also got going in the third quarter. He completed a three-point play on a dunk and free throw that capped a 20-5 run and trimmed the 76ers\u2019 lead to 81-76.  Embiid converted a three-point play, and T.J. McConnell had a bucket in the final seconds of the period to give Philadelphia a 94-92 lead heading into the fourth quarter.  The Suns will look to bounce back against the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday. "

          "body": "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia\u2019s detained opposition leader Kem Sokha called for free and fair elections in the Southeast Asian country in a New Year\u2019s message on Monday.  Kem Sokha, head of the banned opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was arrested in September.  He is accused of trying to overthrow the government of strongman Prime Minister Hun Sen with American help and of espionage - charges he denies and says are politically motivated.  In a two-page letter read by his daughter Kem Monovithya and posted on Facebook on Monday, Kem Sokha said Cambodia faces losing aid and its export markets abroad as well as condemnation by the international community after the CNRP\u2019s dissolution.  \u201cLeave an opportunity for people to choose leadership representatives through an election that is free and fair,\u201d Kem Sokha said, calling for national unity and non-violence to solve the political crisis.  His message comes amid an ongoing crackdown by Cambodia\u2019s government on critics, civil society groups and independent media that rights group say amounts to the destruction of democracy.  Kem Sokha\u2019s CNRP was dissolved by the Supreme Court in November at the request of the government. The decision also banned more than 100 opposition lawmakers from politics.  That prompted the European Union and the United States to withdraw their support of the 2018 election.  Cambodia will hold a general election on July 29. Hun Sen has vowed to extend his more than 30 years in power by at least another decade.  Kem Sokha said 2017 was marked by big political crises that led to a \u201cdemocracy walked backward.\u201d   A spokesman from Hun Sen\u2019s ruling party, Sok Eysan said there was little interest in Kem Sokha\u2019s new year message, adding that opposition politicians could create a new party.  \u201cThey have the political rights as citizens ... to create a new party to compete,\u201d Sok Eysan told Reuters.

The advertisement, which read \u201cPhilippe Coutinho is ready to light up Camp Nou\u201d, was deleted shortly after it appeared and it was unclear if the advertisement was genuine or the website had been hacked, the BBC and other British media reported.  The Catalan side, however, made several attempts at signing the Brazilian last year but could not reach the 200 million euros ($240.04 million) Liverpool wanted for the midfielder, local media reported at the time.  Barcelona said in October they were ready to mount a new bid for the 25-year-old in the January transfer window.  Coutinho missed the start of the Premier League season with injury but has been in strong form, scoring seven times in the league for the Merseyside club.

Landeskog\u2019s two-goal night increased his season total to 16, tying him with Nathan MacKinnon for the team lead. MacKinnon collected three assists, including both of Landeskog\u2019s goals.  Carl Soderberg supplied a goal and an assist for the Avalanche (19-16-3) while winning goalie Jonathan Bernier turned aside 27 of 28 shots to improve his season record to 6-7-1. Patrik Nemeth, Matt Nieto and Erik Johnson also scored for Colorado. Samuel Girard also recorded assists on both of Landeskog\u2019s goals.  Johnson, Alexander Kerfoot and Colin Wilson each chipped in an assist during the victory.  Josh Bailey scored for the Islanders (20-15-4). Jaroslav Halak allowed five goals before he was pulled. He was peppered with 35 shots. Replacement Thomas Greiss stopped 12 of 13 shots.  Nemeth\u2019s second goal of the season midway through the first period put the Avalanche on top.  Colorado made it 2-0 at the 5:25 mark of the second period after Blake Comeau stole the puck from behind the Islanders\u2019 goal. He fed the puck to Soderberg, who dished it to Nieto for his sixth goal of the season.  Soderberg\u2019s seventh goal of the season preceded Landeskog\u2019s power-play tallies. Landeskog\u2019s goals came less than two minutes apart, leading to Halak\u2019s benching.  Bailey averted the Islanders\u2019 first shutout since Nov. 10 with a third-period goal, his 12th of the season. Brock Nelson and Scott Mayfield were credited with assists.  The Avalanche answered 40 seconds later with Johnson\u2019s fifth goal. He was set up by Landeskog and MacKinnon.  The Islanders won the previous meeting, 6-4, on Nov. 5.

Domestic films recorded ticket sales of 30.1 billion yuan in 2017, accounting for 54 percent of total box office, Xinhua reported on Sunday, citing data from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television. Domestic films in 2016 accounted for 58 percent of total box office.  China is the second-largest movie market globally after the United States, though it already has more total movie screens after years of rapid expansion in theater networks.   China added 9,597 screens last year to reach 50,776 in total, the media regulator said. That compares to just over 40,000 screens in the United States, according to data from U.S.-based National Association of Theatre Owners.   The movie \u201cWolf Warrior 2\u201d was China\u2019s highest-grossing film last year, raking in 5.68 billion yuan in ticket sales.  After disappointing box office growth in 2016, regulators announced that all sales grosses would include service fees for each ticket purchased online. This boosted last year\u2019s growth, although moviemakers see little of the additional revenue.   Reporting by Elias Glenn; Editing by Michael Perry"

Matthew Tkachuk added two goals for the Flames, who jumped to a 3-0 lead before Chicago regrouped to force overtime. Calgary (19-16-4) snapped a three-game winless streak and improved to 10-11-0 on its home ice.  \u201cWe can build off this,\u201d Tkachuk said.  Jordan Oesterle, Jonathan Toews and Brandon Saad scored for the Blackhawks. Chicago (18-14-6) earned at least one point against Calgary for the 16th consecutive meeting (10-0-6), a streak that dates to Feb. 2, 2013.  Flames goaltender Mike Smith stopped 34 shots to improve to 15-13-3. On the opposite side of the rink, Blackhawks goaltender Jeff Glass turned aside 35 shots but drew his first career loss two days after earning his first career victory.  Chicago trailed 3-2 late in the third period when coach Joel Quenneville pulled Glass in exchange for an extra attacker. The move paid off as Saad scored with 1:46 remaining in regulation to even the score at 3.  Giordano ensured two points for Calgary when he surprised Glass with a high wrist shot in overtime. The goal marked Giordano\u2019s seventh of the season, three of which have been game winners.  Calgary opened the scoring on a power-play goal by Tkachuk with less than two seconds left in the first period. The second-year left winger struck again on the power play early in the second period with his second goal of the game and 10th of the season.  Monahan increased the Flames\u2019 lead to 3-0 at the 5:47 mark of the second period. He beat Glass with a slap shot that marked his team-leading 18th goal.  Chicago broke through with 11:23 to go in the second period when Oesterle scored his second goal in as many games. Less than a minute later, Toews notched his 10th goal to cut the deficit to 3-2.  Center Mikael Backlund skated in his 500th career game, all of which he has played for the Flames. The 28-year-old Swede already ranks 17th in team history in games played.  \u2014By Field Level Media "
