The Chinese company bought out investors such as Riverwood Capital, Monashees Inc, Qualcomm Ventures, Tiger Global Management LLC and SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), said one of the people.

Didi\u2019s Mexico entry represents the 4-year-old firm\u2019s first move to deploy drivers under its own brand outside of China.

          "body": "Isaiah Thomas has a knack for big performances in Boston, and Cleveland certainly could have used one from him on Wednesday night.  However, Thomas was resting on the second night of a back-to-back after making his season and Cavaliers debut Tuesday, so Cleveland had to fend without him and came up short in a 102-88 loss to the Celtics at TD Garden.  Thomas, who rose to stardom during his three seasons with Boston before the Celtics traded him to the Cavaliers in a deal that netted Kyrie Irving last offseason, sat on the bench as his teammates struggled to find answers for his old squad.  Terry Rozier paced the Celtics with 20 points off the bench. Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart each scored 15 and Jaylen Brown 14 as Boston (31-10) won its fourth straight. Irving finished with 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists.  LeBron James finished with 19 points, seven rebounds and six assists for Cleveland. Kyle Korver hit five 3-pointers for 15 points, and former Celtic Jeff Green scored 13.  The Cavaliers (25-13) have dropped four of their past five.  Cleveland\u2019s Kevin Love left the game with 1:08 to play in the second quarter after injuring his right ankle in a fall earlier in the period. Love finished with two points in 21 minutes.  Boston expanded its 55-47 halftime lead to as many as 20 points in the third quarter before taking an 81-68 advantage into the fourth. The Cavs were outscored 21-20 in the final 12 minutes.  Cleveland shot just 29.2 percent in the opening quarter as Boston jumped ahead 32-21.  During the quarter break, Thomas was shown on the video board and greeted with a booming standing ovation from the Boston fans.  Thomas, who had asked the team not to play a video tribute for him until he is healthy enough to play in Boston, pounded his chest in acknowledgement of the crowd.  The 5-foot-9 guard scored 18 points in his season debut Tuesday against the Portland Trail Blazers after missing the Cavaliers\u2019 first 36 games recovering from a hip injury.  \u201cI was out for seven months. There was no way I was going to (make my return) against Boston (until I\u2019m fully healthy),\u201d Thomas said.  Cleveland beat Boston 102-99 in the season opener in a rematch of last year\u2019s Eastern Conference finals.  Boston ends a four-game homestand Friday against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Cleveland is off until Saturday, when it visits the Orlando Magic for the second contest of its five-game road trip.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "* Dollar held up after strong US manufacturing, construction data  * Fed minutes, more hawkish than expected, also support dollar Dollar index pulls away from 3-1/2-month low  * Greenback gains against safe-havens as risk assets rally (Adds quotes, updates prices)  By Shinichi Saoshiro  TOKYO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Thursday after upbeat U.S. data and supportive minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy meeting helped it shake off recent weakness.  The dollar index, measuring it against a basket of six major currencies, extended the previous day\u2019s bounce to stand 0.02 percent higher at 92.183 . It had declined to 91.751 on Tuesday, its lowest since Sept. 20.  The dollar bounced after Wednesday\u2019s strong U.S. manufacturing and construction data.  It gained further support as the minutes from the Fed\u2019s Dec. 12-13 meeting were more hawkish than anticipated, indicating the central bank is still poised to raise interest rates several times this year.  Fed policymakers acknowledged the U.S. labour market\u2019s solid gains and the expansion in economic activity, even as they affirmed worries about persistently low inflation.  That suggested the central bank will continue to pursue a gradual approach in raising rates but could hasten the pace if inflation accelerates.  \u201cThe dollar did feel downward pressure at the turn of the year, but the selling was not based on very strong factors,\u201d said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  Rebalancing of positions caused by investors closing their books towards the turn of each year can lead to dollar selling.  \u201cAs such, strong U.S. data and the Fed\u2019s minutes, which suggested board members were not as pessimistic towards the potential economic impact of U.S. tax cuts as many in the market expected, helped the dollar get back on course,\u201d Yamamoto said.  The euro was little changed at $1.2016 after losing roughly 0.4 percent overnight. The common currency had surged to a three-month high of $1.2081 on Tuesday against a broadly weaker dollar.  The U.S. currency was 0.15 percent higher at 112.655 yen . It touched a 2-1/2-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday after declining steadily from a high above 113.750, scaled in December.  Increasing investor risk appetite in broader markets also supported the dollar, notably against perceived safe-havens such as the yen and Swiss franc. The latter was at 0.9778 franc per dollar after sliding 0.6 percent the previous day to pull back from a three-month peak of 0.9699.  Buoyed by overnight gains on Wall Street, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei began the first day of trading in 2018 by rallying 2.5 percent. Crude oil prices were at 2-1/2-year highs, helping fuel inflation expectations.  Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, expects dollar/yen to stay around 110 yen in the medium term.  \u201cYen demand stemming from Japan\u2019s current account surplus will be checked by yen selling pressure stemming from \u2018risk on\u2019 generated by global economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cDollar/yen is likely to remain in range around 110 yen amid this tug-of-war.\u201d  The pound was steady at $1.3515, following overnight losses of 0.6 percent, when it fell back from a 3-1/2-month high of $1.3614 against a rebounding dollar.  The Australian dollar was a shade lower at $0.7832 and the New Zealand dollar added 0.1 percent to $0.7098 . (Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro; Editing by Richard Pullin and Richard Borsuk)"

Malaysia\u2019s IPO market saw a revival in 2017 after poor investment conditions, weak oil prices and a volatile ringgit cast a shadow over equity markets in recent years. Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd (LOTT.KL) raised over $850 million in Malaysia\u2019s biggest IPO in five years in July.  IPOs in the pipeline include fast food operator QSR Brands Bhd, which is looking to raise about $500 million, Edra Energy Sdn Bhd, which is targeting $500 million to $1 billion, and Bank Islam Brunei Darussalam Bhd, which is looking to raise as much as $500 million, sources have said.  Samling Group has hired Credit Suisse, Maybank and OCBC to arrange an IPO for its automobile business that could raise up to 1 billion ringgit, IFR - a Thomson Reuters publication - reported on Wednesday.  \u201cWe do expect the first half should see more than 10 billion ringgit raised (from jumbo IPOs),\u201d Derek Lim, CIMB\u2019s head of Equity Capital Markets and Syndicate Asia said at a conference.    \u201cSmall and mid-cap should continue to be quite robust as well,\u201d he said, adding that CIMB does not foresee any impact from a general election that has to called by August.  CIMB Chief Executive Zafrul Aziz said he expects bond and sukuk issues in Malaysia to reach 90 billion ringgit this year, supported by infrastructure projects.   Infrastructure spending in Malaysia has increased over the last year as Prime Minister Najib Razak aims to build momentum and boost the economy ahead of the general election.  Zafrul also said he expects Malaysian banks to see loan growth of 4 to 5 percent, higher than last year.   Malaysian banks are benefiting from a growing domestic economy and firm consumer spending, while improving optimism among businesses versus a year ago is supporting loan growth.  CIMB, Malaysia\u2019s second-largest lender, reported a 10.7 percent rise in quarterly profit in November, driven by higher net interest income, lower provisions and a more robust capital market.  Zafrul did not provide any 2018 financial forecasts for CIMB, but said the group\u2019s provisions for the year will be lower as Thailand and Indonesian markets are expected to improve.

DeMarcus Cousins added 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Rajon Rando chipped in 12 points for the Pelicans. New Orleans (19-18) snapped a two-game losing streak and also ended a five-game skid to the Jazz.  Donovan Mitchell scored 24 points and Joe Johnson added a season-high 20 points to lead Utah. The Jazz (16-22) forced 20 turnovers but could not overcome poor perimeter shooting. Utah made just 7 of 32 (21.9 percent) from 3-point range while losing for the fourth time in five games.  New Orleans had no trouble finding its shot. The Pelicans went 41 of 82 from the field. They made 14 of 30 3-point tries and finished with a 17-4 edge in second-chance points despite collecting just seven offensive rebounds.  Utah opened up a 22-16 lead in the first quarter behind back-to-back baskets from Derrick Favors (11 points, nine rebounds). The Jazz didn\u2019t stay in front for long after Holiday got cooking on offense.  Holiday knocked down seven consecutive baskets without missing a shot over much of the first half. He capped off a 10-0 run with a layup to give the Pelicans a 43-36 lead. Holiday drove for another later in the second quarter to cap off his string of baskets and put New Orleans up 51-44.  Utah rallied and took a 71-69 lead in the third quarter behind back-to-back corner 3-pointers from Johnson and Mitchell. The Pelicans answered with a 15-1 run extending into the fourth quarter, highlighted by back-to-back 3-pointers from Dante Cunningham and Davis, to take an 84-72 lead.  The Jazz made another rally in the fourth quarter to get back into it. Alec Burks made back-to-back baskets to fuel a 9-0 run to cut the deficit to three. New Orleans weathered the storm and pushed the lead back to double-digits when Davis converted a three-point play to make it 91-81 with 5:45 left.  New Orleans concludes it brief two-game road trip against the Timberwolves in Minnesota on Saturday. Utah begins a five-game road trip in Denver against the Nuggets on Friday.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two top law enforcement officials met U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday to discuss demands by congressional supporters of President Donald Trump that the Justice Department hand over  files relevant to investigations of possible Trump 2016 campaign ties to Russia, a source familiar with the meeting said.  FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met Ryan, said AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman who declined to comment on the subject of the meeting.  A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.   Reuters reported in September that the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee had issued subpoenas to Wray and Rosenstein demanding that they surrender their agencies\u2019 files on former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, his  \u201cdossier\u201d on suspected Trump team contacts with Russia and inquiries being made by the FBI and the Justice Department into the dossier\u2019s contents.  Officials said at the time the agencies were reluctant to comply with the subpoenas, backed by House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a Trump supporter, because the FBI was conducting its own probe. That investigation is supervised by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into U.S. allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election campaign to tilt the election in Trump\u2019s favor.      Moscow has denied any effort to influence the election and Trump denies any campaign collusion. Trump supporters have said the \u201cdossier\u201d and other allegations of Trump involvement with Russia are smears concocted by Trump\u2019s political enemies.  News outlets reported in December that Nunes would ask his committee to vote to hold the Justice Department and FBI in contempt of Congress if they did not turn over the material sought by the committee.   Nunes said in a statement he spoke with Rosenstein on Wednesday evening and he now believes his committee has reached an agreement with the Department of Justice that will provide the committee with access to all the documents and witnesses it requested.  \u201cThe committee looks forward to receiving access to the documents over the coming days,\u201d he said.

Asking rents for retail neighborhood and community centers rose 1.8 percent, while effective rent edged 1.9 percent higher, the real estate research firm said.  On an annual basis, 38 metros have a higher vacancy rate but only seven post a decline in asking or effective rent, the report said.

Net absorption for retail neighborhood and community centers, measured in terms of available retail space sold in the market during a certain time period, fell 49.7 percent to 1.85 million square feet.  Mall vacancies have been climbing as retailers, hurt by competition from online retail, have been closing stores and filing for bankruptcy.  Retailer Kmart, a unit of Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O), saw the most closings in the quarter, according to the report.  More companies including Walgreens Boot Alliance Inc (WBA.O), Toys R Us and GAP Inc (GPS.N) would downsize and/or close stores in 2018 while other retailers, gyms and service providers expand, offsetting the vacancies in some metros, the Reis report said.

The Fighting Irish (12-3, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) played for the first time since All-American forward Bonzie Colson sustained an injury in practice that could cost him about eight weeks after undergoing scheduled foot surgery Thursday. He\u2019s the team leader in every major statistical category.

Matt Farrell scored nine points on three 3s.  The Irish shot 11-for-25 from 3-point range (with starters checking in at 11-for-21). Overall, they were at 51.8 percent from the field, helping them eclipse their season scoring average that had been 81.3 points per outing.  Allerik Freeman posted 13 points and Lennard Freeman had 10 points for N.C. State (10-5, 0-2), which opened ACC play with two road games for the first time in 10 years.

State, which committed 15 turnovers in the game and shot 36.7 percent from the field, struggled on offense in several stretches. Allerik Freeman made a 3-point basket on his first shot and then missed his next eight attempts.  Notre Dame leads the series with N.C. State 8-4, including 4-1 in league matchups.

          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. retail real estate vacancies inched up to 10 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, Reis Inc (REIS.O) said in a report released on Wednesday.  Asking rents for retail neighborhood and community centers rose 1.8 percent, while effective rent edged 1.9 percent higher, the real estate research firm said.  On an annual basis, 38 metros have a higher vacancy rate but only seven post a decline in asking or effective rent, the report said.  Construction activity fell 53.4 percent, with 1.48 million square feet of new construction completed, according to the report.  Net absorption for retail neighborhood and community centers, measured in terms of available retail space sold in the market during a certain time period, fell 49.7 percent to 1.85 million square feet.  Mall vacancies have been climbing as retailers, hurt by competition from online retail, have been closing stores and filing for bankruptcy.  Retailer Kmart, a unit of Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O), saw the most closings in the quarter, according to the report.  More companies including Walgreens Boot Alliance Inc (WBA.O), Toys R Us and GAP Inc (GPS.N) would downsize and/or close stores in 2018 while other retailers, gyms and service providers expand, offsetting the vacancies in some metros, the Reis report said.

The source confirmed a report on the rejection by Czech news website www.echo24.cz. The website said the central bank made the initial ruling, which could be appealed, in November.  CEFC, a privately held Chinese group focused on energy and other investments abroad, has spearheaded Chinese investments in the Czech Republic, backed by political support from Czech and Chinese presidents.  It took an initial small stake in JTFG, a banking and investment group operating in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Barbados and Croatia, in 2015.  Other regulators including the European Central Bank have approved the increase of its holding via an acquisition from JTFG founders, Slovak businessmen Ivan Jakabovic and Josef Tkac.  Website www.echo24.cz quoted what it said was the central bank decision as saying the regulator lacked sufficient information on the origin of most of the funding for the deal, or 728 million euros ($874.91 million) out of a deal value of 980.6 million euros.  \u201cThe Czech Republic\u2019s clearance will be the last required for the deal to be closed, and CEFC actually paid around 300 million euros last year (to the sellers),\u201d a CEFC executive with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.   The executive added that the company has secured the rest of the funding from Chinese banks and expected the deal to be closed soon. He did not elaborate further.   CEFC said in a statement on its website on Wednesday it was seeking Czech central bank approval of the deal and believed it had supplied all necessary documents by the end of 2017, but was ready to provide more information if required.  It did not directly confirm the central bank had made an initial negative decision, and a spokesman declined further comment.  A spokeswoman for the Czech central bank declined to comment. A spokeswoman for J&T Finance Group also declined to comment.  CEFC China Energy has emerged from a niche fuel trader to become a rapidly growing oil and finance conglomerate with assets across the world and an ambition to become one of China\u2019s energy giants.  It agreed in September to buy a 14.16 percent stake in Russian oil major Rosneft for $9.1 billion.  Czech President Milos Zeman, who has made closer business ties with China one of his priorities, has appointed CEFC\u2019s founder and Chairman Ye Jianming as an economic policy advisor.  CEFC\u2019s other investments in the Czech Republic include real estate, a brewing group, a football stadium and an airline. It has also been interested in central European television stations group CME (CETV.O).

The seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD UAE Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, which covers manufacturing and services, rose to 57.7 last month from 57.0 in November. Above 50 indicates expansion and below shows a contraction.  Output growth fell sharply last month to 60.7 from 64.3 but remained strong by historical standards, while growth in new orders rose sharply to a 35-month high of 64.8 from 60.1.  Employment continued to grow at the same moderate pace.  \u201cThe UAE\u2019s non-oil sector expanded sharply in the last two months of the year, largely due to a strong rise in output and new orders,\u201d said Khatija Haque, head of regional research at Emirates NBD.  \u201cIt is likely that the introduction of VAT in January has spurred activity and purchasing in the fourth quarter of 2017,  which is in line with our expectations. Nevertheless, employment and wage growth have been relatively muted, not just in December but for 2017 as a whole.\u201d  Output price inflation was negative for a fourth straight month in December, while input price inflation slowed slightly.

          "body": "DUBAI  (Reuters) - Growth of Saudi Arabia\u2019s non-oil private sector slowed slightly in December but remained high compared to levels seen in the past two years, a corporate survey showed on Thursday.  The seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index edged down to 57.3 last month from a two-year high of 57.5 in November. A level above 50 means business is expanding.  Budget data released by the government in mid-December showed that after more than two years of austerity, state spending jumped in the fourth quarter of 2017 as authorities sought to strengthen weak economic growth.  Spending in the fourth quarter was about 354 billion riyals ($94 billion), by far the largest amount in any quarter of 2017 and accounting for 38 percent of all state spending for the entire year. Much of the government money eventually flowed into the private sector, boosting activity.  \u201cThe December PMI survey continued to show a strong rate of expansion in December, and the data suggests that non-oil growth accelerated in the final quarter of 2017, as well as for the year as a whole compared to 2016,\u201d said Khatija Haque, head of regional research at Emirates NBD.  \u201cNevertheless, we expect headline GDP growth to be close to zero in 2017 as substantial oil production cuts will offset the expansion in the non-oil sectors of the economy. We are more optimistic about growth prospects in 2018, however.\u201d    Output growth slowed to 62.8 in December from 64.3 in November, while growth in new orders eased to 63.2. Employment growth sped up slightly to 50.9, however.  Output prices resumed rising very gradually in December after staying flat in November, while input price inflation rose to 54.3 from 52.8.

Denver shot 62.2 percent from the field, including 12 of 27 (44.4 percent) on 3-point attempts.  Devin Booker had 17 points and Marquese Chriss had 16 points for the Suns, whose flight did not land in Denver until about 2 p.m. Wednesday because of mechanical issues and regulations regarding pilot flying time.  Phoenix reserve center Greg Monroe, who had not played in the previous five games, had 16 points, 10 rebounds and four assists while starting in place of Tyson Chandler, continuing a recent trend in which Chandler does not play on consecutive days.  Jokic, who is averaging a double-double, also leads the team in assists. His behind-the-back pass led to Malik Beasley\u2019s breakaway dunk late in the third quarter, when the game turned. Denver outscored Phoenix 37-18 in the third.  The Nuggets made 14 of 21 shots from the field in the decisive quarter while the Suns (15-25) were 5 of 28 in the third.  Denver had a 48-35 rebounding edge and nine blocked shots, five by center Mason Plumlee.  Harris, who made his first eight field-goal attempts, finished 14 of 17 from the field, 3 of 5 from 3-point range.

Harris scored 20 points in the first 10 1/2 minutes of the first quarter, making 9 of 10 shots while being guarded primarily by Booker. The Nuggets led 34-26 after one quarter.

          "body": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian investigators and police hoisted the wreckage of a seaplane from the Sydney river where it sank after crashing on New Year\u2019s Eve, killing six people, including the chief executive of British catering company Compass Group Plc.  Richard Cousins, 58, his two sons, his fiance and her daughter and the pilot were killed when the plane hit the water shortly after takeoff on Sunday.   The family were on a short tourist flight, operated by Sydney Seaplanes, from a waterfront restaurant on the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney, to Rose Bay in the city\u2019s east.   A preliminary report into the crash was expected in about 30 days, with a final report taking up to 12 months, according to Australian Transport Safety Bureau executive director Nat Nagy.  \u201cWe are reasonably confident that we will be able to do a thorough examination of the key components of the aircraft, to understand whether they were operating correctly at the time,\u201d Nagy told reporters.  Police divers wrapped slings around the fuselage and a barge fitted with a small crane slowly lifted the wreck, upside down and without wings, from about 13 meters of water near Cowan, 40 km (25 miles) north of Sydney.      The propeller, cockpit and front section of fuselage were crumpled, and the landing floats were raised separately. The pieces were loaded on to the barge deck and covered with a tarpaulin, television pictures showed.  Air crash investigation records, first reported by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Thursday and reviewed by Reuters, show a plane with the same serial number crashed 21 years earlier, when it was being used as a crop duster.  The 1996 accident report found that the aircraft, a DHC-2 de Havilland Canada, likely stalled and that conditions were gusty when it crashed, killing the pilot.  \u201cIt was repaired after the accident and all appropriate approvals and checks were done. It was then re-registered and went back into service,\u201d a spokesman for Australia\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority said in an email.  A spokesman for Sydney Seaplanes said the company had no comment while the investigation into the crash continues.  Additional reporting by James Regan; Editing by Nick Macfie"

          "body": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is unlikely to meet earlier targets it set for a balanced budget by 2020 and will need another two to three years to reach the goal, the country\u2019s second finance minister said on Thursday.  The shift in the budget target follows comments by ratings agencies late last year that the Southeast Asian economy might struggle to meet its objectives in the stated timeframe due to a run up in spending.  \u201cI don\u2019t think by 2020 (the government) can achieve a balanced budget because if you do that, basically you will squeeze economic development,\u201d second finance minister Johari Abdul Ghani said at a conference, adding the government will have to spend in order to stimulate the economy.  \u201cWe will try to extend it to 2022-23,\u201d he said.  Johari reiterated projections stated previously that the fiscal deficit will be reduced to 2.8 percent of gross domestic product this year from 3 percent in 2017.  Prime Minister Najib Razak has been able to lower Malaysia\u2019s fiscal deficit every year since taking power in 2009 and that has been significant for maintaining Malaysia\u2019s investment-grade sovereign credit ratings.  However, some analysts are concerned the increase in government spending will hinder the pace of deficit reduction going forward.  Najib, under pressure to shore up his government\u2019s popularity, in October unveiled a budget aimed at winning votes in a national election that must be held by August.  He announced a spending increase of 7.5 percent for 2018 from last year, and said the government plans to cut personal income tax for lower-income citizens, pay more to pensioners and spend billions on schools, hospitals and rural infrastructure.  Post the 2018 budget announcement, ratings agency Moody\u2019s said it does not expect Malaysia to achieve the balanced budget target by 2020. Rising spending in the run up to the elections and lack of revenue reforms slowed the pace of deficit reduction, it said.  Fitch, however, said in October Malaysia\u2019s 2020 target would \u201crequire a step-up in consolidation efforts in 2019 and 2020, but is not unattainable.\u201d  Najib faces his toughest election yet as he looks to counter bad publicity from a corruption scandal involving state-owned fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and a growing challenge from Mahathir Mohamad, his former mentor turned rival.  Malaysia\u2019s economy expanded at its fastest pace in more than three years in the third quarter of 2017, a turnaround from 2016 when low oil prices hurt.

          "body": "SYDNEY, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Australia said Thursday it planned to become the fourth country in the world to legalise medicinal marijuana exports in a bid to score a piece of the estimated $55 billion global market.  Cannabis cultivation in Australia is still relatively small, as recreational use remains illegal. But the government hopes domestic medicinal use, legalised last year, and exports will rapidly boost production.  \u201cOur goal is very clear: to give farmers and producers the best shot at being the world\u2019s number one exporter of medicinal cannabis,\u201d Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters in Melbourne.  Shares in the more than a dozen Australian cannabis producers listed on the local exchange soared after the announcement.  Cann Group, AusCann Group and BOD Australia all rose more than 20 percent, hitting record highs, while Hydroponics Company rose 19 percent to its highest price in a month.  Peter Crock, chief executive of Cann Group, which cultivates cannabis for medicinal and research purposes, said medicinal marijuana production had been stymied by limited demand from Australian patients.  \u201cWhile the Australian patient base is growing, it is very small,\u201d Crock told Reuters. \u201cBeing able to export will allow us to have the scale to increase production.\u201d  Hunt said the new legislation would include a requirement that growers first meet demand from local patients before exporting the remainder of their crop.  Despite growing demand, only Uruguay, Canada and the Netherlands have so far legalised the export of medicinal marijuana. Israel has said it intends to do so within months.  The Australian government\u2019s proposal needs to pass federal parliament when it returns to session in February. The country\u2019s main opposition Labor Party has signalled it would support the move.  Exports would then likely begin within months.  Fuelled by a growing acceptance of the benefits of marijuana to manage chronic pain, moderate the impact of multiple sclerosis and to soften the effects of cancer treatment, several countries and 29 states in the United States have legalised cannabis for medicinal use.  Australia\u2019s chief commodity forecaster does not publish data on cannabis production, but rough estimates by the University of Sydney estimated the legal industry at A$100 million ($78 million), well below the C$4 billion ($3.19 billion) that Canada estimates its market to be worth.  U.S. consultancy company Grand View Research last year forecast the global medicinal cannabis market would be worth $55.8 billion by 2025.  $1 = 1.2780 Australian dollars\n$1 = 1.2542 Canadian dollars\nReporting by Colin Packham; Editing by Jane Wardell and Gerry\nDoyle"

          "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Former sumo grand champion Harumafuji has been fined 500,000 yen  ($4,400) for assaulting a junior wrestler, a court in Tottori, western Japan said on Thursday after prosecutors filed a summary indictment rather than seek a trial.  Harumafuji retired in November for injuring fellow Mongolian Takanoiwa while drinking at a restaurant-bar with other wrestlers, an incident that has threatened to taint the image of Japan\u2019s national sport just as it was regaining popularity.  Prosecutors had filed the summary indictment against the former \u201cyokozuna\u201d (grand champion) for injuring Takanoiwa by hitting him on the head with a karaoke machine remote control.  A Japan Sumo Association\u2019s crisis management committee report had found that Harumafuji, angered that Takanoiwa was checking his smart phone after being chastised for a bad attitude by yokozuna Hakuho, slapped and hit the younger wrestler with a remote control device.  Following last week\u2019s summary indictment, Harumafuji\u2019s lawyer released a statement on his behalf.  \u201cBecause of this incident, my life as Harumafuji is now set to be sharply different from what I thought it would be. I have a feeling of chagrin, to be honest. But the responsibility is all mine,\u201d he said in the Dec. 28 statement.  The incident has thrown a spotlight on sumo\u2019s struggle to reform harsh conditions that can breed violence in its closed, hierarchical world, although some wrestlers say there have been improvements in the decade since a trainee was beaten to death.

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, January 03 (Fitch) The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) designation last week of another Chinese bank subsidiary - ICBC Asia - as a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB) is reflective of Chinese banks' increasing presence in the territory, says Fitch Ratings. Higher capital requirements for Hong Kong's six D-SIBs, which accounted for about half of banking assets at end-1H17, support system stability. Nevertheless, there is a risk that system-wide capitalisation fails to stay commensurate with rising China-related risks. Hong Kong's gross mainland China exposure (MCE) accounts for around one-third of system-wide assets and we expect continued robust growth in 2018. MCE was up by 21% yoy at end-1H17. A significant and rising share of this China-related business is conducted through foreign bank branches - particularly of Chinese banks - which are not subject to minimum capital ratios. Moreover, Hong Kong's counter-cyclical buffer applies only to domestic exposures. The regulator, therefore, faces a challenge in ensuring system-wide capitalisation keeps pace with rising MCE. D-SIB designation could be one way in which the regulator can require banks to hold more capital - even though it would not automatically cover smaller banks with high appetite for mainland exposure. ICBC Asia is the second subsidiary of a Chinese bank, after Bank of China (Hong Kong) (BOCHK), to be added to the D-SIB list. It is possible that the two banks will eventually be joined by China Construction Bank's Hong Kong subsidiary, CCB Asia, which we believe is next in line - albeit with some gap. Indeed, CCB Asia and CCB's Hong Kong branch would already qualify as a D-SIB if combined (see chart). The global regulatory trend points toward combination of subsidiaries and branches into a single presence, although there have been no indications from the Hong Kong authorities that this is being considered. <iframe src=\"https://e.infogram.com/ac1667c5-e1ea-4dfe-bb5f-907bf30f78d0?src=embed \" title=\"Final D-SIB Scores for Selected Hong Kong Banks\" width=\"523\" height=\"721\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"> The branches of two other Chinese banks - Bank of Communications (BOCOM) and Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) - are also large. BOCOM's branch is in the process of transferring its retail and private banking operations into its Hong Kong subsidiary, which could become a D-SIB in time. The HKMA's current stance is that foreign branches, which are not subject to capital adequacy requirements, will not be formally designated as D-SIBs. However, the HKMA will consider increasing supervision of branches if they become systemically important and may oblige them to operate through a subsidiary rather than a branch if their potential failure becomes a threat to the economy. ICBC Asia's regulatory capital buffers will increase by 1% from 2019 to reflect its D-SIB status. The bank already comfortably meets the higher capital requirement; its common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.5% at end-June 2017. Its D-SIB status will also be likely to necessitate the bank to meet new total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, which the HKMA is due to consult on in 1Q18. The HKMA also moved Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) (SCBHK) into a lower bucket, which means its D-SIB buffer will fall to 1.0% from 1.5%. The change might be due to growth in other banks, which could have reduced its relative importance, or could be down to supervisory overlay. Our calculations show it still ranks above other banks in the lowest bucket - Bank of East Asia (BEA) and ICBC Asia.

World number two Muguruza hopes to step up her preparations for the Australian Open after she was forced to retire with leg cramps during her opening match at the Brisbane International on Tuesday.  \u201cI\u2019ve only played in Sydney once before and I really enjoyed the conditions there, and the beautiful city,\u201d the 24-year-old Spaniard said in a statement.  \u201cThis wildcard is a very valuable opportunity for me get back on the court and hopefully play a few more matches before the first Grand Slam of the year in Melbourne.  \u201cThe Sydney draw is incredibly strong and there will be no easy matches.\u201d  The tournament, which begins at Sydney Olympic Park on Sunday, will feature three of the four current women\u2019s grand slam holders as Muguruza will be joined by US Open champion Sloane Stephens and Roland Garros winner Jelena Ostapenko.  The field also include seven-time grand slam winner Venus Williams, two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, 2016 Australian and US Open champion Angelique Kerber and Australia\u2019s 2011 US Open champion Sam Stosur.

          "body": "Stephen Curry buried a tie-breaking 3-pointer with three seconds remaining Wednesday night, allowing the visiting Golden State Warriors to survive a frantic Dallas Mavericks rally for a 125-122 victory.  Stephen Curry (32), Kevin Durant (25) and Klay Thompson (25) all topped 20 points as the Warriors (30-8) beat the Mavericks (13-26) for the ninth straight time while winning their eighth in a row on the road, matching the second-longest road streak in the NBA this season.  The Warriors can tie the season-high of nine, set by the Boston Celtics, when they visit the Houston Rockets, who are without James Harden, on the second night of a back-to-back Thursday.  After trailing 120-110 with 2:46 to play, the Mavericks rallied into a tie by scoring 10 straight, including 3-pointers by Yogi Ferrell and Wesley Matthews.  Harrison Barnes\u2019 15-footer with 39 seconds remaining forged a 120-all deadlock.  Thompson converted a Durant assist into a layup to put Golden State back up by two with 24 seconds remaining, before Barnes, the former Warrior, set up Curry\u2019s dramatics with a tying layup with 12 seconds left.  Dennis Smith Jr.\u2019s desperation 40-footer at the buzzer was off the mark.  Curry was playing for just the second time since an 11-game absence due to a sprained ankle. He exploded for 38 points in his return to the court Saturday against Memphis.  Draymond Green, who was disqualified from the Warriors\u2019 last game after drawing two technical fouls in the second quarter, had an 18-point, 11-rebound double-double for Golden State, which had beaten Dallas by 30 and 15 points earlier this season.  Durant also finished with 11 rebounds.  Matthews had 22 points and Dwight Powell 21 for the Mavericks, who began the night on a four-game winning streak, equaling their longest since April of 2016.  Matthews hit seven 3-pointers in the game as Dallas outscored Golden State 57-39 from beyond the arc.  Barnes (18), Smith (14), J.J. Barea (13), Dirk Nowitzki (12) and Ferrell (11) also scored in double figures for the Mavericks, who went 8-8 in December.  Curry had 15 of his 32 points in the first quarter, helping Golden State go up 35-26 by period\u2019s end.  The Warriors led by as many as 12 before the Mavericks rallied to within 67-61 at halftime, using 11 second-quarter points from Dwight Powell as a springboard.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "title": "CBA bond issue boosts Australian banks' funding options",
          "body": "* CBA bond attracts three times anticipated amount  * Investors shrug off sector woes, govt enquiry  * Fund managers say rest of Big Four could follow  By Paulina Duran  SYDNEY, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia has raised $1.25 billion in 30-year subordinated debt in the United States in a successful auction that fund managers said on Thursday could encourage other Australian banks to follow suit.  Australia\u2019s biggest bank by market capitalisation attracted three times the amount it wanted to raise, a sign offshore investors are not too concerned about a money-laundering lawsuit against CBA and a looming government enquiry into the country\u2019s banking sector.  \u201cIt\u2019s a strong result for the issuer given the significant volume, long tenor and competitive funding cost achieved and may prove tempting for other issuers,\u201d said Vivek Prabhu, the head of fixed income at Perpetual.  CBA had first flagged it would offer 1.75 percent over U.S. Treasuries for the bond, but cut that to a 1.53 percent spread after receiving high demand form yield-hungry investors, Thomson Reuters IFR Magazine reported.  Life insurance companies were particularly eager for the bonds, CBA Treasurer Paolo Tonucci said.  \u201cDebt spreads have contracted significantly over the last 24 months,\u201d Tonucci said in an emailed statement. \u201cIn particular, subordinated debt has become less costly to issue.\u201d  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group did not immediately reply to questions about whether CBA\u2019s spreads would prompt them to consider such long-dated subordinated issues. Westpac Banking Corp and National Australia Bank declined to comment.  Jonathan Rochford, portfolio manager at Narrow Road Capital, said the solid demand for such issues should encourage banks to further diversify their funding.  \u201cAustralian banks (should) fill their boots with ultra-long-term subordinated capital at these levels,\u201d Rochford said. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for not building subordinated capital further and providing additional buffer against taxpayer bailouts.\u201d  However, one senior executive at a global investment bank said that while CBA had achieved a good price, the extra long maturity was not a natural fit for Australian banks. Speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to the speak to the media, the executive noted that those assets consisted mainly of housing loans that tended to be repaid in 5 years to 7 years.  Australia\u2019s banks are among the world\u2019s most profitable. But a series of scandals have cost them hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and moved the government to launch a far-reaching inquiry into the sector with the power to recommend criminal charges.  CBA is defending allegations by Australia\u2019s anti-money laundering agency that it allowed thousands of suspicious transactions to pass through its systems, including failing to report attempts to wire money by an individual convicted of terror-related offences.

          "body": "Jordan Murphy moved within a game of Tim Duncan\u2019s all-time NCAA record for consecutive double-doubles to start a season Wednesday night, scoring 17 points and grabbing 17 rebounds as Minnesota bounced Illinois 77-67 at Williams Arena in Minneapolis.  Murphy has double-doubles in all 16 Golden Gopher games and can tie Duncan\u2019s 21-year-old mark Saturday when Minnesota (13-3, 2-1 Big 10) hosts Indiana. Murphy is averaging 19 points and nearly 13 rebounds per game.  The Golden Gophers led 13-2 and never trailed, putting all five starters in double figures. Nate Mason added 17 points after missing Sunday\u2019s 65-55 win over Harvard with an ankle injury, while Amir Coffey hit for 16.  Dupree McBrayer contributed 12 points and center Reggie Lynch chipped in his own double-double with 11 points and 12 rebounds. With Murphy and Lynch sweeping the glass, Minnesota won the rebounding battle, 48-39.  Leron Black tallied 14 points to pace the Fighting Illini (10-6, 0-3) and freshman guard Trent Frazier scored 12. But Illinois simply couldn\u2019t overcome a rocky start that saw it miss 18 of its first 19 shots and trail by 20 points just over 12 minutes into the game.  The Fighting Illini gave it a good run, slicing the deficit to 39-26 at the half and making their move midway through the second half. When Da\u2019Monte Williams tipped in Michael Finke\u2019s missed 3-pointer with 10:14 remaining, Illinois closed within 55-51.  Black sank a 3-pointer with 3:57 left in the game that drew the Fighting Illini within 65-60. But Mason applied the dagger, hustling to grab the rebound of a McBrayer air ball and swishing a corner 3-pointer with 3:25 remaining for an eight-point lead.  The Golden Gophers converted 45 percent of their field goal attempts, thanks to 12-of-21 shooting in the second half. They overcame poor 3-point shooting (5-of-20) and missed a dozen of their 34 free throw tries.  Illinois made only 25 of 72 field goal tries for the night and was 7-of-28 from the 3-point arc.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Losing Alibaba\u2019s 2014 listing to New York was embarrassing for a city that has thrived connecting China to world markets. Hong Kong could go some way to making up for this in 2018.   New York has been the go-to venue for initial public offerings of Chinese technology firms. It hosts more internet companies than Hong Kong and the market is simply much bigger. U.S. investors have traditionally been more open to backing loss-makers. And founders can retain outsize control relative to their economic stakes, which is not possible in Hong Kong.   That is starting to change. The Fragrant Harbour hosted a string of well-received tech flotations in 2017, some of them unprofitable. The growing number of stocks means analysts and investors are increasingly well informed about the sector. And Hong Kong has an in-built cultural advantage: it is more welcoming of Chinese bosses who do not speak English, and of apps that would baffle an American audience.  So the stage is set for Hong Kong to win over China\u2019s up-and-coming tech players. The biggest include news aggregator Toutiao, food-delivery to hotel-bookings group Meituan-Dianping, and ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing. Actual or potential fundraisings in 2017 valued the three at $20 billion, $30 billion and $50 billion, respectively. All three could list in 2018. Assuming valuations rise by one-quarter by the time the trio list and they sell up to 25 percent stakes, the IPOs could raise over $30 billion. Lufax, a peer-to-peer lender backed by Ping An Insurance, is another prospective candidate.  The potential clincher for these companies is due in 2018, when firms will probably be allowed to list with multiple classes of shares. This is not great news for investors: Hong Kong lost Alibaba\u2019s record-breaking IPO because of the regulator\u2019s principled objection to unorthodox voting rights. There are some signs of movement in the other direction stateside. And weakening the system does not bode well for governance in an already scandal-prone market. But it will undoubtedly increase the city\u2019s attraction for company founders. Expect Hong Kong\u2019s tech sector to expand in 2018.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Many in Los Angeles\u2019 Iranian expatriate community, the largest in the United States, are heartened by anti-government street protests back home but want to make sure international focus stays on what they see as a struggle for democracy.  Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution and are concentrated in a neighborhood on the city\u2019s west side nicknamed \u201cTehrangeles\u201d dotted with Persian shops and restaurants. The community is welcoming support for the protesters from political leaders of both parties in the United States.  Roozbeh Farahanipour, a leader of the 1999 student movement who was jailed three times before fleeing the country under a death sentence and winning asylum in the United States, said moral support from U.S. leaders was crucial, praising supportive tweets from both President Donald Trump and his rival in the 2016 election, Democrat Hillary Clinton.   In 2009, Farahanipour said, some activists were disappointed when then-President Barack Obama showed support for reformers instead of those seeking regime change.  \u201cIt\u2019s exciting that this time there is no reformist movement involved. The people realize that reform is not going to work this time. They want regime change,\u201d he said.   Any pro-regime Iranians with ties to the government who may live in the area have kept a low profile.   Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards have dispatched forces to several provinces after six days of street demonstrations that began out of frustration over economic hardships suffered by  youth and the working class that have left 21 people dead.  Activists in Los Angeles are planning a rally on Sunday at a federal building on the city\u2019s west side to show moral support for the uprising and draw attention to the struggle going on in their homeland.  Roxanne Ganji, a prominent Los Angeles-based pro-democracy activist whose father served as minister of education under the last Shah before his 1979 overthrow, said this generation of protesters seemed to less fearful than their predecessors.  \u201cThe youth don\u2019t have any future,\u201d Ganji said. \u201cA lot of (Iranians) come to L.A. after they finished college there and they are happier to be a waiter here. The economic situation is dire.\u201d  The protests erupted in working-class neighborhoods over economic stagnation, high unemployment and allegations of graft within clerical and security hierarchies. They have evolved into a larger clash against the powers and privileges of a remote elite especially Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.   Sid Mohasseb, an Iranian author and adjunct business professor at the University of Southern California, said U.S. media comparisons to a 2009 revolt over accusations of election fraud failed to consider that the earlier uprising was driven by middle-class Iranians who had stronger ties to the government.  \u201cThis is massive, across the country, and it started with a different class of people. This is folks that are hurting in the pocketbook,\u201d Mohasseb said. \u201cI actually think its going to go somewhere precisely because they (in the government) can\u2019t identify the leaders. If you say, \u2018Here is the leader,\u2019 they\u2019ll go after that leader and take him out.\u201d  Reporting by Dan Whitcomb; Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Cynthia Osterman"

Antetokounmpo and Middleton combined to hit 21 of 32 shots, with Middleton knocking down 3 of 4 from beyond the arc. Overall, the Bucks shot 58.7 percent from the field and were 9-for-17 from distance as they scored 100 points or more for the 19th time in their last 20 games and hit the 120-point mark for the third time this season.  Thon Maker and Malcolm Brogdon had big nights off the bench for Milwaukee, combining for 29 points on 10-of-19 shooting. Brogdon added five assists while Maker grabbed four rebounds and blocked a shot in 22 minutes of work.  Matthew Dellavedova finished with eight points but dished out nine assists, marking his third consecutive game with nine or more assists, and the Bucks set a season-high with 33 assists on 44 makes.  Indiana fell to 0-6 on the season without leading scorer Victor Oladipo, who missed a fourth straight game because of soreness in his left knee.  Domantas Sabonis made 10 of 13 shots and led Indiana with 24 points. Darren Collinson had 17 and Lance Stephenson added 15 with seven rebounds and five assists for the Pacers, who shot 48.8 percent but were just 3-for-15 on 3-point attempts.  Antetokounmpo hit 8 of 11 shots and scored 21 points in the first half as Milwaukee only hit 2 of 3 3-pointers but shot 62 percent from the floor to go into halftime with a 62-52 lead.  The Bucks held Indiana to 21 points in the third while stretching their lead to 17 to open the fourth quarter. Antetokounmpo spent all of the final period on the bench but that wasn\u2019t enough to help the Pacers, who fell behind by 23 with six minutes to play.  With the loss, Indiana fell to .500 (19-19) but still holds a one-game lead over Philadelphia for the eighth place in the East. Milwaukee (20-16) began the day sixth in the conference, holding a tiebreaker over Miami.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Vinnie Hinostroza, Nick Schmaltz, Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane also scored for the Blackhawks, who registered three-plus goals for the third straight game after failing to do so in each of the previous three contests. Chicago (19-14-6) improved to 9-9-4 on the road.  Nick Holden and Mika Zibanejad scored in a losing effort for the Rangers. New York (21-14-5) dropped to 15-7-3 on its home ice and lost in regulation for only the second time in the past nine games.  Blackhawks goaltender Jeff Glass earned his second win in three career games, all of which have come in the past week with No. 1 netminder Corey Crawford out due to an injury. The 32-year-old turned aside 23 of 25 shots, including a point-blank attempt from Rangers left winger Rick Nash in the final two minutes when New York pulled its goaltender for an extra attacker.  Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist fell to 18-10-4 despite making 30 saves on 33 shots.  Chicago opened the scoring on Hinostroza\u2019s second goal of the season with 3:51 to go in the first period. Two minutes later, New York evened the score at 1 on a long slap shot from Holden.  Schmaltz broke the tie midway through the second period with his eighth goal of the season and his second in the past four games. The Rangers clawed back again on a slap shot by Zibanejad for his 12th goal.  Sharp put Chicago on top for good 2:24 into the third period. His snap shot from the left circle hit the underside of the crossbar and ricocheted into the net for his fourth goal of the season and his first since Nov. 27. The 36-year-old has struggled badly this season and recently sat out several games as a healthy scratch.  Toews added an empty-net goal with 53.4 seconds remaining to make it a two-goal game. Kane flicked a backhand shot into the back of an empty net with 4.9 seconds left to finish the scoring.  \u2014Field Level Media"

Foster scored 12 of his points in the second half and made a quick pass to Thomas (17 points), who then sank his three from the right corner that gave the Bluejays a 76-71 lead with 14 seconds left.  Thomas got a break as his shot hit off the rim, bounced up and fell through for the crucial 3-pointer.  The Bluejays have won seven of their last eight games. Creighton (12-3, 2-1) beat Providence in a Big East game last Sunday after falling to Seton Hall in the conference opener three days before that.  Creighton used the game\u2019s second big streak to take the lead for good in the second half. The Bluejays scored 13 in a row and 20 of 24 for a 66-60 lead.  St. John\u2019s (10-5, 0-3) kept battling back, cutting the lead to one twice, and the Red Storm had a chance to tie in the final minute. However, Marvin Clark II missed the front end of a one-and-one when Creighton had a 73-71 lead with 41 seconds left, and St. John\u2019s dropped its third consecutive game.  Martin Krampelj added 14 for Creighton in the victory.  Five St. John\u2019s players finished in double figures, led by Bashir Ahmed (21 points), Justin Simon (14 points) and Tariq Owens (14 points).  The Red Storm got the game\u2019s first big streak at the end of the first half, a 14-0 run that prompted a 43-36 lead at the break.  Shamorie Ponds scored five and handed out two assists during that stretch and finished with 12 points, five assists and five steals. Ponds missed the previous game with an injury.  However, Marcus LoVett\u2019s injury woes continued for St. John\u2019s as he sat out for an eighth consecutive game. Ponds entered the game as the team\u2019s top scorer with LoVett ranked second.  \u2014By Field Level Media"

          "body": "(Adds rating was downgraded from investment grade to junk)  HONG KONG, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Wednesday downgraded Dalian Wanda Commercial Property Co Ltd by two notches to a junk rating, citing the company\u2019s inability to access offshore funding channels to boost its liquidity in a timely manner.  The rating agency downgraded Wanda Commercial to \u2018BB+\u2019 from investment grade \u2018BBB\u2019, the second downgrade since 2016. Fitch also maintained its \u2018Rating Watch Negative\u2019 to reflect the continued lack of definitive funding channels to boost Wanda\u2019s offshore liquidity.  Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, parent of Wanda Commercial and owned by one of China\u2019s richest men, Wang Jianlin, has invested heavily in entertainment and sports assets over the last few years. This has drawn the attention of Chinese regulators looking to stem perceived risky spending overseas.  \u201cWanda\u2019s liquidity position may come under substantial pressure if its offshore syndicated loan lenders demand for early repayment and Wanda fails to meet these demands promptly; or it fails to raise sufficient offshore liquidity to repay the $510 million second tranche of its offshore syndicated loan due in March 2018,\u201d Fitch said in a statement.  Wanda failed to issue offshore senior notes by the end of 2017 despite gaining the National Development and Reform Commission\u2019s (NDRC) approval for $1.5 billion in issuance quota, and it\u2019s still uncertain when State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) will approve Wanda to remit onshore fund offshore, it added.  \u201cThis could trigger the cross-default clauses for the $1.2 billion in senior notes, and add to repayment pressure.\u201d  Rating agencies S&P and Moody\u2019s last year downgraded Wanda Commercial to below investment grade.  Dalian Wanda Group last month said its 2017 revenues surpassed 200 billion yuan ($30.25 billion) and it had an equal amount in cash, responding to a local online media report that questioned the group\u2019s financial health.

Dinwiddie\u2019s fadeaway jumper finished off a showing in which he had 26 points and nine assists.

MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.1 percent, coming near its 2007 peak, with Australian shares hitting a decade high.  Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped 2.0 percent on its first trading day of the year while the broader Topix hit its highest level since 1991.  \u201cThe economic data published over the holiday period has been pretty good. So for those who were worried about new year profit-taking, the market would look pretty strong,\u201d said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.  The economic data published on Wednesday on both sides of the Atlantic reinforced investors\u2019 expectations that solid global growth will boost demand of goods including oil and lift corporate earnings.  U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, boosted by a surge in new orders growth, in a further sign of strong economic momentum at the end of 2017.  In Germany, Europe\u2019s economic power house, the unemployment rate hit a record low of 5.5 percent in December, underpinning a broad-based economic upswing.  The world\u2019s stock markets hit a record high on Wednesday.  On Wall Street, the three main stock indexes hit record closes, helped by a 1.5 percent rise in energy stocks.  Oil prices hovered at 2 1/2-year highs as the anti-government protests in Iran that began last week rattled Tehran\u2019s clerical leadership and left 21 people dead so far, raising concerns about supply.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded at $61.84 per barrel, having risen to as high as $61.97 a barrel, their highest level since June 2015.  Still, investors are expecting markets to be stable, with Cboe Volatility index, which measures implied price volatility of U.S. stocks in the next one month, closing at 9.15, just above record closing of 9.14 touched on Nov 3.  In the past few months, the volatility index has been kept at one of the lowest levels since the global financial crisis in 2008.  That is primarily because investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve and the world\u2019s other major central banks will tighten monetary policy only gradually with few signs of inflation pressures building.  The minutes of the Fed\u2019s last policy meeting on Dec. 12-13 released on Wednesday did little to change that perception.  They showed policymakers saw President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cut plans as providing a boost to consumer spending but also uncertainty over the impact of fiscal stimulus on raising price pressures.  The price of Fed funds rate futures fell a tad, with April contract pricing in about 75 percent chance of a rate hike by March, compared to around 60 percent at the end of last year.  In the currency market the dollar ticked up 0.2 percent against the yen to 112.69 yen following the upbeat U.S. data while the euro was little changed at $1.2002.  Editing by Sam Holmes"

Forward Kelly Olynyk scored a game-high 25 points, guard Goran Dragic added 24 and forward Josh Richardson posted the 10th 20-point game of his career and seventh of this season with 22 as the Heat (20-17) evened the season series with the Pistons at a win apiece.  Tobias Harris led the Pistons (20-16) with 19 points and guard Reggie Bullock hit a season-best 5 of 8 3-pointers on his way to 17 points.

Ish Smith scored 6 points in his third start since taking over for Reggie Jackson.  The Heat went to the locker room up 56-52 at the half after outscoring the Pistons 32-23 in the second quarter.  They got to the free-throw line only twice in the first half, making one, while the Pistons were 9-for-11 from the stripe, but the Heat made up for that with blistering 3-point shooting. They were 11-of-20 from behind the arc in the first two quarters, with Richardson and Olynyk each hitting three of their four attempts.  The Pistons were only 3-of-9 on 3s in the first half, with guard Avery Bradley banging home a 35-footer at the buzzer for his second in four attempts.  The Heat finished the game 17-of-34 from outside, compared to 9-of-24 for the Pistons.  The back and forth swings that marked the first half continued in the third quarter with the Heat running off 10 consecutive points for a 76-67 lead and the Pistons responding with a 12-2 burst for a 79-78 lead.

          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A former mayor and his son were killed on Wednesday in central Mexico, adding to an uptick in murders of politicians ahead of national elections later this year.  Miguel Angel Licona, 76, a former mayor of the municipality of Mixquiahuala in the state of Hidalgo, was shot dead along with his son, according to a statement from state prosecutors.   Licona had been mayor for President Enrique Pena Nieto\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the 1990s.  The state attorney general\u2019s office said that investigators had ruled out a political motive to the murder.   In October, another former mayor in Hidalgo was murdered but the government also ruled out any tie to politics and said the killing was the result of an armed robbery.  In recent months, about a dozen politicians, officials and candidates for elected office have been killed in states where there are struggles between criminal groups for the control of drug trafficking routes.  Mexico last year registered its highest murder total since modern records began, according to official data, dealing a blow Pena Nieto\u2019s pledge to get gang violence under control ahead of elections this year.  On July 1, Mexico will elect its next president as well as more than 600 lawmakers, while many states will also hold local elections. Concerns about rising violence and corruption have hammered Pena Nieto\u2019s popularity.   Violence has in the past flared up during elections in areas of the country where gangs seek to influence local politics.  Reporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Editing by Sandra Maler"

The Wizards (22-16) completed a 3-0 homestand by limiting the Knicks to seven points in the first 10 1/2 minutes of the third quarter while they turned a one-point halftime advantage into an 87-70 lead.  Wall had eight points, Marcin Gortat seven and Beal six in the decisive 23-7 run, during which the Knicks missed 13 of their 16 shots and committed six turnovers.  Wall accounted for one of the turnovers, stealing a Kristaps Porzingis pass and converting it into a dunk in the second minute of the period, pushing the Washington advantage to 68-63. Beal did the same to Jarrett Jack, stealing the ball and racing downcourt for a dunk that made it a 79-66 game at the 7:47 mark of the period.  The lead grew to 17 three minutes later, after which the Knicks got no closer than 11 in the third period and 10 on two occasions late in the game.  The loss was the fourth in five games for the Knicks (18-20) during a stretch in which they will play six of seven on the road.

Dario Saric contributed 15 points for the Sixers, who improved to 18-19. They won for the third straight game and snapped a 12-game losing streak to the Spurs, dating to 2011. The Sixers also broke a five-game home losing skid.  The Sixers received a surprising lift with Embiid in the starting lineup. Embiid had been listed as doubtful to play with a sore hand, but he managed to post his 16th double-double of the season. Philadelphia is 2-7 without Embiid.  The short-handed Spurs played without a number of key players including Rudy Gay (right heel bursitis), Manu Ginobili (rest), Danny Green (left groin), Kawhi Leonard (quadriceps) and Tony Parker (injury management). Leonard scored 25 points in his first action of the season in a 100-91 win at New York on Tuesday.  Patty Mills led the Spurs with 26 points off the bench while LaMarcus Aldridge added 24 points and 14 rebounds. Bryn Forbes scored 15 points, Kyle Anderson added 14 and Davis Bertans 13.  The Spurs dropped to 26-13.  The Sixers built a 16-point lead early in the third quarter before the Spurs mounted a comeback. Mills was especially effective with seven points late in the third on a 3-pointer and a rare four-point play.  Philadelphia led 88-84 after the third.  Three free throws by Redick put the Sixers ahead 93-84, but the Spurs quickly ripped off six consecutive points to close within 93-90 with 7:06 remaining.

Simmons\u2019 basket via goaltending by Aldridge followed by a free throw for a conventional three-point play gave the Sixers a 106-103 lead. Soon after, Redick hit a jumper for a 108-104 advantage.  On the Spurs\u2019 next possession, Aldridge fumbled the ball out of the bounds and the Sixers eventually secured the win.  \u2014By Field Level Media"

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s services sector activity expanded at its fastest pace in over three years in December on solid growth in new business, with the outlook improving to a six-month high, a private sector survey showed on Thursday.  The upbeat findings broadly echo those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector last week that showed activity accelerated at a faster rate in December than the previous month, reinforcing the view that an expected slowdown in the broader economy would be gradual.  The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose to 53.9 in December, from 51.9 in November and the highest reading since August 2014.   A reading above 50 indicates growth, and a reading below signals contraction on a monthly basis.  New business increased at the fastest pace since May 2015, with survey respondents reporting sales supported by strong underlying client demand and new projects.  China\u2019s leaders are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance economic expansion from its heavy reliance on investment and exports.  The services sector accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power at home and abroad.  The survey also showed input price inflation for services firms in China in December matched March\u2019s reading at 53.8, higher at 51.7 in November.  Companies were able to pass through higher input costs to clients, though at a slightly slower pace than in November.   A similar private sector survey of manufacturers on Tuesday also suggested input costs remained high, fueled by China\u2019s government\u2019s tougher pollution measures in a battle against thick winter smog.  That report showed the manufacturing sector expanded at the fastest pace in four months as firms cranked up production to meet a surge in new orders.   Driven by strong readings in both the services and manufacturing sectors, the headline Caixin China Composite PMI rose to 53.0 in December, compared to 51.6 in November and the highest in a year.  \u201cExpansions in total new orders and new export business supported optimism among manufacturers and service providers towards the business outlook for next year,\u201d Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note with the report.   \u201cAlthough China\u2019s economic growth remains under downward pressure, it is still resilient. However, special attention should be paid to whether future policies will become tighter than expected.\u201d   The world\u2019s second-biggest economy has defied market expectations with growth of 6.9 percent in the first nine months of 2017, supported by a construction boom and robust exports.  Sources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilizing build-up of debt.

          "title": "Security flaws put virtually all phones, computers at risk",
          "body": "FRANKFURT/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Security researchers on Wednesday disclosed a set of security flaws that they said could let hackers steal sensitive information from nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.  One of the bugs is specific to Intel but another affects laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets and internet servers alike. Intel and ARM insisted that the issue was not a design flaw, but it will require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix.  \u201cPhones, PCs, everything are going to have some impact, but it\u2019ll vary from product to product,\u201d Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday afternoon.   Researchers with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Project Zero, in conjunction with academic and industry researchers from several countries, discovered two flaws.  The first, called Meltdown, affects Intel chips and lets hackers bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer\u2019s memory, potentially letting hackers read a computer\u2019s memory and steal passwords. The second, called Spectre, affects chips from Intel, AMD and ARM and lets hackers potentially trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information.  The researchers said Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp had patches ready for users for desktop computers affected by Meltdown. Microsoft declined to comment and Apple did not immediately return requests for comment.  Daniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered Meltdown, called it \u201cprobably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found\u201d in an interview with Reuters.  Gruss said Meltdown was the more serious problem in the short term but could be decisively stopped with software patches. Spectre, the broader bug that applies to nearly all computing devices, is harder for hackers to take advantage of but less easily patched and will be a bigger problem in the long term, he said.  Speaking on CNBC, Intel\u2019s Krzanich said Google researchers told Intel of the flaws \u201ca while ago\u201d and that Intel had been testing fixes that device makers who use its chips will push out next week. Before the problems became public, Google on its blog said Intel and others planned to disclose the issues on Jan. 9. Google said it informed the affected companies about the \u201cSpectre\u201d flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the \u201cMeltdown\u201d flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017.  The flaws were first reported by tech publication The Register. It also reported that the updates to fix the problems could causes Intel chips to operate 5 percent to 30 percent more slowly. (bit.ly/2CsRxkj)  Intel denied that the patches would bog down computers based on Intel chips.  \u201cIntel has begun providing software and firmware updates to mitigate these exploits,\u201d Intel said in a statement. \u201cContrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.\u201d  ARM spokesman Phil Hughes said that patches had already been shared with the companies\u2019 partners, which include many smartphone manufacturers.  \u201cThis method only works if a certain type of malicious code is already running on a device and could at worst result in small pieces of data being accessed from privileged memory,\u201d Hughes said in an email.  AMD chips are also affected by at least one variant of a set of security flaws but that it can be patched with a software update. The company said it believes there \u201cis near zero risk to AMD products at this time.\u201d  Google said in a blog post that Android phones running the latest security updates are protected, as are its own Nexus and Pixel phones with the latest security updates. Gmail users do not need to take any additional action to protect themselves, but users of its Chromebooks, Chrome web browser and many of its Google Cloud services will need to install updates.  Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing service used by businesses, said that most of its internet servers were already patched and the rest were in the process of being patched.  The defect affects the so-called kernel memory on Intel x86 processor chips manufactured over the past decade, The Register reported citing unnamed programmers, allowing users of normal applications to discern the layout or content of protected areas on the chips.  That could make it possible for hackers to exploit other security bugs or, worse, expose secure information such as passwords, thus compromising individual computers or even entire server networks.  Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security consulting firm Trail of Bits, said that businesses should quickly move to update vulnerable systems, saying he expects hackers to quickly develop code they can use to launch attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities. \u201cExploits for these bugs will be added to hacker\u2019s standard toolkits,\u201d said Guido.  Shares in Intel were down by 3.4 percent following the report but nudged back up 1.2 percent to $44.70 in after-hours trading while shares in AMD were up 1 percent to $11.77, shedding many of the gains they had made earlier in the day when reports suggested its chips were not affected.  It was not immediately clear whether Intel would face any significant financial liability arising from the reported flaw.  \u201cThe current Intel problem, if true, would likely not require CPU replacement in our opinion. However the situation is fluid,\u201d Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities in New York said in a note, adding it could hurt the company\u2019s reputation.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Wednesday found a Turkish banker guilty of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions, after a nearly four-week trial that has strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey.  Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank (HALKB.IS), was convicted on five of six counts he faced, including bank fraud and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions law, in Manhattan federal court.  Atilla was also found not guilty on a money laundering charge.   Prosecutors had accused Atilla of conspiring with gold trader Reza Zarrab and others to help Iran escape sanctions using fraudulent gold and food transactions. Zarrab pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecutors.  In several days on the witness stand, Zarrab had described a sprawling scheme that he said included bribes to Turkish government officials and was carried out with the blessing of  current President Tayyip Erdogan.  Halkbank had no immediate comment. Attempts to reach Erdogan\u2019s spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful. Erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government.   In brief public remarks after the verdict was announced, Erdogan made no comment on the trial but a senior Turkish government official rejected the verdict.  U.S. prosecutors have criminally charged nine people, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, have been arrested by U.S. authorities.  \u201cForeign banks and bankers have a choice: you can choose willfully to help Iran and other sanctioned nations evade U.S. law, or you can choose to be part of the international banking community transacting in U.S. dollars,\u201d Joon Kim, the acting U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement after the verdict was read. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do both.\u201d       U.S. District Judge Richard Berman scheduled Atilla to be sentenced on April 11.      Victor Rocco, one of Atilla\u2019s lawyers, told reporters that the banker would ask Berman to overturn the verdict and would appeal if necessary.  \u201cWe believe he\u2019s innocent,\u201d Rocco said. \u201cWe intend, and he intends, most importantly, to continue to fight and clear his name.\u201d      The trial carried echoes of an investigation in Turkey in 2012 and 2013 that involved Zarrab and multiple government officials. One of the prosecutors\u2019 witnesses was a former Turkish police officer, Huseyin Korkmaz, who said he led that investigation.  Korkmaz said he was jailed in retaliation, and eventually fled to the United States, carrying evidence from his investigation with him.  A senior government official in Turkey said Wednesday\u2019s verdict was \u201cvoid.\u201d   \u201cWe consider this verdict void in every sense; international law has been violated,\u201d said the official, who declined to be named. \u201cIt cannot have a negative impact on the Turkish economy, banking system or Halkbank, specifically.\u201d      Last month, Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul demanded in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Korkmaz be returned to Turkey, calling him \u201ca fugitive, a terror suspect facing serious allegations.\u201d  The Turkish government has said that followers of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen were behind both the Turkish investigation and the U.S. case, as well as the 2016 failed coup in Turkey. Gulen has denied the accusations.              Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Additional reporting by Orhan Coskun in Ankara; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Alistair Bell"

          "body": "Markus Howard made history Wednesday night, tying a personal record with 11 3-pointers and finishing with a program-record 52 points in Marquette\u2019s 95-90 overtime victory over Providence.  Howard had gone 6-for-23 in his previous three games and had just 10 points on 2-of-8 shooting \u2014 including 2-of-6 from distance \u2014 in the first half but he knocked down seven 3s after the break and scored 32 on 11-of-16 shooting in the second half, with 10 more in the overtime period.  The Golden Eagles also got 16 from Andrew Rowsey while shooting 50 percent from the floor and 13-of-26 from distance.  Providence was playing shorthanded with leading scorer Rodney Bullock (16.9 points per game) unavailable because of the flu. Isaiah Jackson moved into Bullock\u2019s spot in the starting lineup and finished with 19 points while Kyron Cartwright led the Friars with 29 on 8-of-15 shooting.  Down 38-37 at halftime, Marquette opened the second half with a 10-2 run to go up 47-40 with 17:31 to play and after the Friars rallied to tie it at 52, Howard\u2019s 3 from top of the key put the Golden Eagles back in front. He followed with another from distance on Marquette\u2019s next possession and the Golden Eagles would eventually stretch their lead to eight.  But Providence wasn\u2019t finished. Marquette went cold and the Friars ripped off a 16-2 run to go up 75-69 on Jackson\u2019s layup with 2:27 remaining.  Then it was the Friars\u2019 turn to cool off and Marquette came to life, using a 10-4 run, including six in a row, to tie the game at 79 when Howard converted a three-point play with 24 seconds left.  Rowsey\u2019s 3-point attempt at the buzzer was short.  Howard opened the extra session with another 3-pointer and Rowsey connected less than a minute later, pushing the Golden Eagles to a four-point lead.  The Friars got as close as two, but couldn\u2019t overtake Marquette.  \u2014By Field Level Media"

          "body": "YANGON (Reuters) - Ever since Reuters Myanmar reporter Wa Lone was arrested on Dec. 12 on suspicion of violating the Official Secrets Act, friends and former colleagues have poured out their hearts and expressed hopes for his release on social media.  Wa Lone and colleague Kyaw Soe Oo, who was also arrested, had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.  Major governments, including the United States, the European Union and Canada, and top U.N. officials, are among those demanding the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.  In Myanmar, which is still in transition after almost half a century of strict military rule, speaking out in support of journalists and others who run afoul of the authorities is more the exception than the rule.  A relative of Kyaw Soe Oo, who is based in Rakhine State, where animosity between the Buddhist Rakhine community and Rohingya Muslims is intense, said his friends were reluctant to show support for him given the divisive atmosphere.   Government spokesman Zaw Htay, when asked about social media support for the pair, said such a campaign should not be done while a case was being heard in court.  \u201cDuring the trial, they need to prove they\u2019re right and they\u2019re innocent,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cThe complainant will accuse and the accused should defend. They should think about how their pressure will affect the court.\u201d   The following are some of the numerous comments about Wa Lone, who has done voluntary charity work, helping poor children.  Thiha Maung Maung, a former colleague of Wa Lone\u2019s at the People\u2019s Age journal.  \u201cHe speaks frankly, he has a very good attitude and always helps out friends.\u201d  \u201cI am very sad to see that not only the government but also some people are seeing Ko Wa Lone as a traitor,\u201d he said, using a Burmese honorific that means \u201cbrother\u201d.  \u201cKo Wa Lone loves the country. He is someone who serves for the benefit of the country in whatever role he can.\u201d   \u201cWe, friends, are waiting for the day of his release.\u201d  Wi Sara, a monk who studied English with Wa Lone.   \u201cWa Lone is someone who studies knowledge and who shares that knowledge.\u201d  \u201cAs a journalist ... he goes after information that should be known and then presents it.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t believe he tried to sell the country\u2019s secrets for\u00a0dollars, which many people are accusing him of doing. I see that he tried to share information that should be known to the people. So, I wish for Lone\u2019s release.\u201d  Ei Pwint Rhi Zan, a friend who Wa Lone did charity work with.  \u201cHe is very kind to people who are in trouble. He is someone who always wants to help and loves the truth.\u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s someone we never have to worry would do something wrong. He never treated anyone badly and he has a very good attitude. He is very kind-hearted. He is strong-minded.\u201d  San Naing, a member of the Benevolent Youth charity group which Wa Lone is involved with.  \u201cHe\u2019s a good volunteer worker, a real volunteer worker.\u201d  \u201cWe can always rely on him during our donation trips ...\u00a0 Whenever he\u2019s on the trip, we feel energized. He makes the kids happy.\u201d   Myat Nyein Aye, a former colleague of Wa Lone\u2019s at the Myanmar Times newspaper.  \u201cKo Wa Lone is always helpful to others and he loves kids a lot and wants kids to be educated.\u201d  Mindy Walker, English-language teacher:  \u201cHe was an eager kid who was hoping for a better future for himself, his family and his country.\u201d  \u201cHe brought joy everywhere he went and made everyone feel special ... Wa Lone was especially involved in making children\u2019s lives better.\u201d  \u201cAlways smiling. Always giving. Always there to help. He doesn\u2019t belong in prison. He belongs in the community telling stories ... spreading messages of peace.\u201d\u00a0  Despite the praise for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo expressed by their supporters, many\u00a0people in Myanmar have criticized the journalists.  \u201cMedia should understand that if they sell information about the country just for dollars, things become complex,\u201d wrote a Facebook user named Linn Aung, commenting on a Myanmar news report about the two journalists.  \u201cMyanmar citizens of foreign news agencies should be loyal to their country,\u201d Facebook user Pinky Shine commented in response to another Myanmar media report about the pair.

          "title": "Uber is sued over payment for mobile ads it called fraudulent",
          "body": "(Reuters) - A British mobile advertising agency has sued Uber Technologies Inc to force the ride-hailing company to pay millions of dollars of bills that Uber had refused to pay after claiming that ads being generated were fraudulent.  Fetch Media Ltd filed its lawsuit on Tuesday in the same California federal court where Uber had sued Fetch in September, accusing the agency of billing it for nonexistent, nonviewable or fraudulent ads, and failing to pass back rebates and commissions.  Uber voluntarily dismissed that lawsuit on Dec. 22, two weeks after the case was reassigned to U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, and said it would instead pursue related claims in a San Francisco state court.  Ad fraud, sometimes called click fraud, is a persistent issue in online advertising, occurring when automated programs mimic legitimate users by clicking ads.  Fetch, a London-based unit of Japan\u2019s Dentsu Inc, suggested that Uber dismissed its federal case on concern it might lose after it was assigned to Rogers, who has overseen other litigation involving the San Francisco-based company.  In Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit, Fetch asked that Rogers be assigned to determine both companies\u2019 contractual responsibilities, and direct Uber pay more than $19.7 million of invoices still owed for 2017.  \u201cFetch does not believe that Uber can avoid federal-court scrutiny of its incorrect contract theories so easily,\u201d the company said.  Uber did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.  The Association of National Advertisers, a trade group, last May estimated that marketers would lose $6.5 billion in 2017 because of fake web traffic caused by \u201cbots.\u201d  Uber said in September that it had hired Fetch to place ads to encourage new riders to download the Uber app, and would pay for \u201clegitimate clicks\u201d that helped attract riders.  But it said Fetch wrongly claimed credit for app downloads that occurred without ads ever being clicked. Uber said it paid Fetch more than $82.5 million, but that Fetch\u2019s failure to stop  ad fraud contributed to at least $50 million of damages.  According to Uber, the alleged fraud surfaced in early 2017 as customers began complaining about where its ads appeared.  Uber said, in one example, it had asked Fetch not to place ads on Breitbart.com, the conservative news website run by Steve Bannon, a former strategist for U.S. President Donald Trump, but that ads appeared there anyway.  In court papers, Fetch called Uber a \u201cfaithless business partner,\u201d and said it had helped Uber monitor ad fraud despite not being contractually required. Fetch also said its work helped Uber register more than 35 million riders.  The case is Fetch Media Ltd v. Uber Technologies Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-00015.

During Thursday\u2019s meeting, the two policymakers agreed to employ fiscal and monetary policy harmoniously to sustain the growth rate in Asia\u2019s fourth largest economy while also aiming for financial market stability.

          "title": "As millions go hungry, India eyes ways to stop wasting $14 billion of food a year",
          "body": "NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For Bhaskar Kumar it is a struggle to name green leafy vegetables found in India for his homework as his staple diet is rice and salt with vegetables served only on festive occasions.  But the eight-year-old from Pilakhana village in India\u2019s northern state of Uttar Pradesh decides not to ask his mother Shakuni Bai, aware she skipped dinner four times that week.  For Bai is among 194 million Indians going hungry daily, according to the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) - despite India wasting food worth about $14 billion a year, according to government figures.  India, one of the world\u2019s largest food producers, is trying to tackle waste during production, processing, retailing and consumption by funding internal initiatives and by partnerships on best practice and technology with overseas investors.  But many of those struggling to get enough to eat are concerned that progress is too slow in India which ranked 100 among 119 countries in the 2017 Global Hunger Index, with 14.5 percent of the population undernourished.  Bai said her problems getting food came when three years of inadequate rainfall were followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u201cdemonetisation\u201d, when two of the highest denomination notes were scrapped in November 2016.  \u201cI had my own land where I used to grow rice and wheat alternately but with three years of consecutive drought I mortgaged my land to pay the mounting debt,\u201d Bai, 42, said during an interview at her mud-and-brick hut in Pilakhana.  \u201cI decided to give myself a last chance and was planning to pay the mortgage by farming as the forecast suggested good rain in the coming months but then demonetisation happened. The little money I had saved to buy seeds became worthless,\u201d adding by the time she changed her notes the price of seed had soared.  Bai now works as a daily laborer, earning 120 Indian rupees ($1.87) a day, which is not enough to support her family of eight that includes five children.  The paradox of millions going hungry in India while food goes to waste is receiving increasing amounts of attention as the FAO stresses that one third of food produced globally for human consumption is wasted every year.  As the World Economic Forum has highlighted, food production is clearly not the main issue as India needs 225-230 million tonnes of food per year to feed its population - and farm output in 2015-2016 hit more than 270 million tonnes.  Sharad Pawar, a former agriculture minister, once told parliament that nearly 40 percent of the value of annual production was wasted, with crops left to rot in the sun without storage or transportation, or eaten by insects and rats.  This wastage has a knock-on effect on the environment as well, as the efforts made to produce this generates greenhouse gases, uses water, and can lead to deforestation.  But while India\u2019s Amul, the world\u2019s largest dairy cooperative, has been widely praised for successfully processing huge amounts of milk quickly and safely for years, spurring the so-called \u201cWhite Revolution\u201d in India, authorities have struggled to stop vast amounts of grain wasting every year.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI), the nation\u2019s main grain procurement agency set up about 50 years ago, now sits on mounds of rice and wheat and has faced criticism for being too weighed down by process and bureaucracy to solve the problems.  A report by the government\u2019s Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) published last year involved a detailed analysis on shortcomings of the FCI including wastage, misappropriation, and  fraudulent payments.  An official with the FCI, who wished to remain anonymous, said a key reason for food waste is damage caused by a lack of infrastructure which it is trying to overcome by investing in building new cold storage facilities over the next five years.  But while this food is wasted, millions of people are going hungry, with 38.4 percent of children aged under five stunted, according to the Global Hunger Index.   \u201cThis reflects the chronic lack of balanced food,\u201d said Ashish Agarwal, a food rights activist with Aligarh-based non-profit group UDAAN Society that focuses on rural development.  \u201cThe under-5 mortality rate is 4.8 percent in India, partially because of inadequate nutrition and unhealthy environment.\u201d   Critics are concerned that it is not enough to just focus on boosting grain storage, as 350 million of India\u2019s 1.3 billion people live in rural locations where electricity is unreliable and erratic so the use of cold storage facilities limited.  They want to see improved transportation to move food supplies faster, and faster food processing so less is wasted.  Raghav Rajan, a farmer from Chakwas village in India\u2019s western Rajasthan state, shies away from government storage, saying traditional storage methods are better to preserve food.  \u201cWe store fruits and vegetables with neem leaves (a medicinal herb) which act as a pest resistant agent. We also use dry chillies to kill any insects infecting the grains,\u201d said Rajan, talking in a field near his house.  He said he preferred to do this as the 1,900 or so storage facilities built by the government around the country are mostly city-based and using them incurred transport costs.  \u201cMoreover, there is no surety that our crops won\u2019t rot in these facilities,\u201d he added.   The Indian government, however, has said it is trying to stop food losses and address hunger in various ways, including changing distribution strategies and using technology.  The Ministry of Food Processing Industries is working with the private sector companies to provide pre-cooling and chilled storage from the farm to the consumer, with about 228 projects underway by August last year.   Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare, Shobhana Pattanayak, said the government distributes excess grain through a public distribution system.  Under this system the government buys food grain from farmers and distributes it at subsidized prices to the poor, selling wheat and rice at two and three rupees a kg compared to the market price of 12 and 13 rupees.  But the system has come under fire from some locals who say  supplies and the quality can be erratic with grain from the distribution system being siphoned off by middlemen who sell it at a higher prices than the market rate.  \u201cThe superior quality food grains are sold in the black market by the middlemen and the bad quality wheat and rice is given to us at a subsidized rate,\u201d said Ali Sher, head of Pilakhana village in Aligarh district of Uttar Pradesh state.  \u201cA small quantity of good quality rice is mixed with rotten portion to increase the volume and sold to us at subsidy. It is better to starve than to eat rodent-infested food.\u201d  Sagheer Ahmed, professor at the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Aligarh Muslim University, said a lack of storage was the main reason for wasted food grain along with no concrete system for processing perishable fruits and vegetables.  \u201cThere is also a huge communication gap between farmers and scientists and ... they fail to benefit from the technologies developed by us.\u201d  ($1 = 64.0250 Indian rupees)  Editing by Belinda Goldsmith @BeeGoldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.

Tucker Center.  Down 81-77 with under a minute to go, North Carolina guard Theo Pinson stole the ball and found wide open fellow guard Joel Berry, who drilled a 3-pointer with 29.8 seconds left to pull the Tar Heels to within one point, 81-80.  North Carolina then fouled and sent Florida State forward Phil Cofer to the line, where he missed both shots to set the stage for a dramatic finish.  Berry drove down the lane but missed his one-handed floater with 1.7 seconds left and Seminoles guard Terance Mann grabbed the rebound. Mann, however, also missed both free throws, allowing the Tar Heels one last gasp with 1.5 seconds on the clock.  But Tar Heels guard Kenny Williams\u2019 desperation heave from half court was off the mark.  The win not only evened the Seminoles\u2019 ACC record at 1-1 and snapped a seven-game losing streak to the Tar Heels, but it extended the nation\u2019s third-longest home winning streak to 28 straight games. Only Cincinnati (34 games) and SMU (33 games) have longer home win streaks.  Florida State (12-2 overall, 1-1 in the ACC) was led by guard Braian Angola\u2019s 20 points and five rebounds. Fellow guard CJ Walker also had a big game, pouring in 18 points for the Seminoles. Walker and the Seminoles made 11 3-pointers in the victory, including a combined seven from deep by Angola and Walker.  North Carolina (12-3, 1-1) was led by star guard Joel Berry III with a game-high 28 points, but it wasn\u2019t quite enough.  After taking a comfortable 51-40 lead to halftime, the Seminoles came out flat in the second half and nearly gave this one away.  North Carolina roared back and tied the game at 58-58 at the 12:56 mark of the second half, but the Seminoles broke a 67-67 tie thanks to a 9-0 run and regained the edge, 76-67, with 7:10 left in the game on back-to-back and-ones and a 3-pointer by Walker.  The Seminoles had already drilled nine 3-pointers by halftime, including three from Angola, who was coming off a career-high 23 points in the Seminoles\u2019 last game out \u2014 a 100-93 loss to No. 2 Duke.  North Carolina also got 18 points from Williams and 14 points from forward Luke Maye. Tar Heels forward Cameron Johnson added seven points and had a team-high eight rebounds in the loss.  Mann was the Seminoles\u2019 only other double-figurer scorer with 17 points and a team-high nine rebounds.  Florida State\u2019s last win against North Carolina before Wednesday came in 2012 in the ACC Championship Game.  The Seminoles continue their tough opening stretch to ACC play Saturday when it travels to face in-state rival and No. 15 Miami, which came into Wednesday with just one loss on the year.  North Carolina\u2019s next game is also Saturday as the Tar Heels travel to face No. 8 Virginia.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Bone-chilling cold across the U.S. farm belt riled agriculture markets at midweek as concerns over crop damage and delayed export shipments sent prices of key food commodities soaring.  Exporters along the Gulf Coast, the country\u2019s largest outlet for grains, scrambled for barge loads of corn and soybeans as two weeks of sub-freezing Midwest weather froze the Illinois River, a major grain barge shipping waterway.  In the Plains, hard red winter wheat prices <0#KW:> hit the highest in six weeks on worries that crops sustained freeze damage, while cattle prices <0#LC:> hit seven-week peaks on concerns over slowed beef cattle production at feedlots.  And although the harshest cold in the farm belt has likely passed, forecasters expect temperatures in the central United States to remain well below normal through at least the end of the week.   \u201cThe worst may be over, but the damage is done,\u201d said Drew Lerner, chief agricultural meteorologist with World Weather Inc.  \u201cIce accumulations will continue aggressively in the upper parts of the Mississippi and Illinois River basin over the next four days,\u201d he said.  Prices for grain barges rallied for a second day on Wednesday as Gulf Coast exporters were forced to turn to shipments loaded along the Ohio River, which was not iced over.  \u201cExporters are trying to get some insurance bushels in their hands. There\u2019s not going to be anything coming off the Illinois River for a couple of weeks,\u201d said a grain barge trader who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media.  Soybean barges loaded in January and delivered to the Gulf traded as high as 50 cents over Chicago Board of Trade March futures, the highest since late September. January corn barges traded at 47 cents above CBOT March futures, a 10-month high.  CME Group Inc, which owns the CBOT, said it is monitoring the icy conditions on the river, where its approved delivery stations are located. The exchange\u2019s January soybean contract is currently in delivery.  \u201cAt present the majority of regular shipping stations are able to make/take deliveries,\u201d spokesman Chris Grams said in an email.  Benchmark HRW wheat prices on the Chicago Board of Trade on Wednesday climbed to the highest since Nov. 22 on worries over deteriorating crop conditions.  Temperatures in central and southwest Kansas, eastern Colorado and northern Oklahoma were low enough for long enough on Monday to damage or kill some dormant hard red winter (HRW) wheat, which is milled for flour to make bread and pizza crust.  How broad the damage was will not be clear until the crop breaks dormancy in late winter or spring.  Crop conditions in Kansas, the top HRW producer, are already deteriorating. The U.S. Department of Agriculture rated just 37 percent of the crop in good to excellent condition at the end of December, down from 51 percent a month earlier.  Colder air across the U.S. Plains lifted benchmark CME live cattle futures to a seven-week high late last week as beef packers rushed to secure livestock. Prices are expected to ramp higher this week as frigid weather may slow weight gains in cattle and make it difficult to sort and load livestock - which limits their availability to processors.  \u201cLate last week and this week on the cattle market there has been some difficulties in transporting animals and even meat in some areas of the Plains, Upper Midwest\u00a0and in the Eastern United States,\u201d said Colorado-based Livestock Marketing Information Center Director Jim Robb.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former U.S. National Security Agency contractor has agreed to plead guilty to stealing classified information, according to court filings on Wednesday, in what may have been the largest heist of U.S. government secrets in history.  Harold Martin is scheduled to plead guilty to one count of willful retention of national defense information at a federal court in Baltimore on Jan. 22, according to the filings.  Prosecutors said Martin, who was indicted last February, spent up to 20 years stealing highly sensitive government material from the U.S. intelligence community related to national defense, collecting a trove of secrets he hoarded at his home in Glen Burnie, Maryland.  Authorities said they seized 50 terabytes of data from Martin\u2019s home, which officials said could be the biggest theft of classified information in U.S. history.  The government has not said what, if anything, Martin did with the stolen data.  He faces up to 10 years in prison on the single count. Martin has not struck a plea deal with prosecutors and could still be tried on the remaining 19 counts in the indictment, the court filings said.  A lawyer for Martin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The NSA has been hit by a series of damaging data breaches in recent years.  In December, former NSA employee Nghia Hoang Pho pleaded guilty to illegally taking classified information that an intelligence official said was later stolen from his home computer by Russian hackers.   Martin worked for Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp when he was taken into custody in August 2016.  Booz Allen also employed Edward Snowden, who leaked a trove of secret files to news organizations in 2013 that exposed vast domestic and international surveillance operations carried out by the NSA.  Martin was employed as a private contractor by at least seven companies, working for several government agencies beginning in 1993 after serving in the U.S. Navy for four years, according to the indictment.  His positions, which involved work on highly classified projects involving government computer systems, gave him various security clearances that routinely provided him access to top-secret information, it said.  The indictment also alleged that Martin stole documents from U.S. Cyber Command, the CIA and the National Reconnaissance Office.  Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Peter Cooney"

Geopolitical uncertainty in Iran, OPEC\u2019s third largest producer, is also helping to support the price as citizens are again protesting the government,\u201d said by William O\u2019Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia\u2019 Rivkin Securities.  Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards have deployed forces to three provinces to put down anti-government unrest that has been ongoing for a week, their commander said on Wednesday.  In the United States, crude oil inventories fell by 5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 29 to 427.8 million barrels, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Wednesday.  Potentially undermining the trend towards tighter market conditions is U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has risen by almost 16 percent since mid-2016, hitting 9.75 million barrels per day (bpd) at the end of last year.

          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico\u2019s government on Wednesday denounced forecast price hikes by fuel retailers and tortilla makers, saying increases were unjustified as it sought to allay public concern about high inflation at the start of a presidential election year.  Prices for corn tortillas, the Mexican staple, are forecast to rise in the coming days by between nearly 11 and 21 percent, according to figures from the National Union of Industrial Mills and Tortillas.  Meanwhile, gasoline and diesel prices are seen by one retail association rising an average of about 7 percent this year due to tax changes, volatility of the peso currency and higher crude prices.  \u201cThat they say they are now going to hike prices is unjustified. We don\u2019t see the market conditions for this to happen,\u201d said Jose Rogelio Garza, a deputy economy minister.  The forecast from the Mexican Association of Gasoline Businesses (AMEGAS) was quickly dismissed as false in a statement by state-run oil company Pemex, but that did not stop complaints.  \u201cMy suppliers bring me the dough by car and if gasoline prices go up then obviously they are going to have to adjust their prices,\u201d said Jorge Garcia, the owner of a Mexico City bakery.  The price of liquefied natural gas, used for cooking, rose by an average of 25 percent in 2017, while electricity rates have also inched up, according to government data.  \u201cWith increasing gas prices we\u2019re going to have to make adjustments... I can\u2019t work without gas,\u201d said Garcia.  As inflation hovers near a 16-year high at just below 7 percent, officials insisted the forecast price spikes, which have triggered social media outrage and threats of protests, are not warranted.  \u201cIn 2018, variations in international fuel prices will continue to be cushioned,\u201d the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday, emphasizing a scheme that allows it to reduce a key excise tax applied to fuel sales.  With presidential elections looming in July, the government is especially sensitive to the possibility that protests could further erode its support among voters.  But beyond rhetoric, the government is mostly powerless to force the hands of gas station owners as its ability to set prices ended in late November after it finalized a gradual, nationwide fuel liberalization.  The move to market prices, part of sweeping 2013-2014 energy reform, ending a transitional period during which it still set maximum gasoline and diesel prices.  The fuel regulator, or CRE, said in a statement that prices in central Mexico for Pemex\u2019s Magna gasoline, which makes up more than 80 percent of total sales, have only risen 1.3 percent compared to average prices at the end of November, an increase it described as stable.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The CRE reported that the average nationwide price on Tuesday for Magna stood at 16.13 pesos per liter.  That works out to about $3.15 per gallon at the current exchange rate.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For many years prior to the passage of the energy reform, fuel prices in Mexico were set by the government and were the same across the country.

          "body": "Jan 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose to their best level in nearly 10 years on Thursday, with miners and healthcare stocks at the forefront as solid gains on Wall Street and strong oil prices also inspired buying in the region.  The S&P/ASX 200 index rose as much as 0.5 percent to 6,102.2, its highest since January 2008. The benchmark had risen 0.2 percent on Wednesday.  On Wall Street, the S&P 500 index rose above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and other major indexes hit record closing highs as technology stocks climbed after signs of robust economic growth.  U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, boosted by a surge in new orders growth, in a further sign of strong economic momentum at the end of 2017.  Aussie shares were propped up by miner BHP Billiton , which also has a large exposure to oil, and Woodside Petroleum, after oil prices shot through the roof over escalating tensions in Iran, a major oil and gas producer.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here is that geopolitics is back in play as a result of the proxy war between the Saudis and Iranians across the region,\u201d Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader, said in a note.  \u201cBut geopolitics has become a bigger factor now that the Iranian protest movement has launched into the open in the past week.\u201d  BHP rose advanced 1.4 percent to its highest since May, 2015, and was headed for its eighth straight session of gains, while Woodside surged to a near two-and-a-half year high.  The Australian energy index climbed as much as 1 percent to its highest since July, 2015.  Elsewhere, a source said Vale SA is in talks with BHP over the future of their joint venture, Samarco Minera\u00e7\u00e3o SA, with a buyout of BHP\u2019s stake in the venture by the Brazilian miner possibly on the table.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Bone-chilling cold across the U.S. farm belt riled agriculture markets at midweek as concerns over crop damage and delayed export shipments sent prices of key food commodities soaring.  Exporters along the Gulf Coast, the country\u2019s largest outlet for grains, scrambled for barge loads of corn and soybeans as two weeks of sub-freezing Midwest weather froze the Illinois River, a major grain barge shipping waterway.  In the Plains, hard red winter wheat prices <0#KW:> hit the highest in six weeks on worries that crops sustained freeze damage, while cattle prices <0#LC:> hit seven-week peaks on concerns over slowed beef cattle production at feedlots.  And although the harshest cold in the farm belt has likely passed, forecasters expect temperatures in the central United States to remain well below normal through at least the end of the week.   \u201cThe worst may be over, but the damage is done,\u201d said Drew Lerner, chief agricultural meteorologist with World Weather Inc.  \u201cIce accumulations will continue aggressively in the upper parts of the Mississippi and Illinois River basin over the next four days,\u201d he said.  Prices for grain barges rallied for a second day on Wednesday as Gulf Coast exporters were forced to turn to shipments loaded along the Ohio River, which was not iced over.  \u201cExporters are trying to get some insurance bushels in their hands. There\u2019s not going to be anything coming off the Illinois River for a couple of weeks,\u201d said a grain barge trader who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media.  Soybean barges loaded in January and delivered to the Gulf traded as high as 50 cents over Chicago Board of Trade March futures, the highest since late September. January corn barges traded at 47 cents above CBOT March futures, a 10-month high.  CME Group Inc, which owns the CBOT, said it is monitoring the icy conditions on the river, where its approved delivery stations are located. The exchange\u2019s January soybean contract is currently in delivery.  \u201cAt present the majority of regular shipping stations are able to make/take deliveries,\u201d spokesman Chris Grams said in an email.  Benchmark HRW wheat prices on the Chicago Board of Trade on Wednesday climbed to the highest since Nov. 22 on worries over deteriorating crop conditions.  Temperatures in central and southwest Kansas, eastern Colorado and northern Oklahoma were low enough for long enough on Monday to damage or kill some dormant hard red winter (HRW) wheat, which is milled for flour to make bread and pizza crust.  How broad the damage was will not be clear until the crop breaks dormancy in late winter or spring.  Crop conditions in Kansas, the top HRW producer, are already deteriorating. The U.S. Department of Agriculture rated just 37 percent of the crop in good to excellent condition at the end of December, down from 51 percent a month earlier.  Colder air across the U.S. Plains lifted benchmark CME live cattle futures to a seven-week high late last week as beef packers rushed to secure livestock. Prices are expected to ramp higher this week as frigid weather may slow weight gains in cattle and make it difficult to sort and load livestock - which limits their availability to processors.  \u201cLate last week and this week on the cattle market there has been some difficulties in transporting animals and even meat in some areas of the Plains, Upper Midwest\u00a0and in the Eastern United States,\u201d said Colorado-based Livestock Marketing Information Center Director Jim Robb.

          "body": "(Reuters) - A Utah man was charged on Wednesday with using a police tip line to threaten to kill President Donald Trump last month when Trump was visiting the western state.  A federal grand jury in Salt Lake City indicted Travis Luke Dominguez, 33, on two counts of threatening the president and other charges, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a written statement.  Dominguez, a resident of the Salt Lake City suburb of Midvale who was arrested on Sunday in nearby South Jordan, made his threats by posting to an online tip line for local police, Melodie Rydalch, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, said in an email.  On Dec. 4, Dominguez wrote, \u201cI woke up and decided going to kill the president,\u201d adding that he expected to die at the hands of police, according to court papers.   Dominguez also was charged with making a separate threat the same day against Trump, who was visiting Utah at the time and spoke at the state capitol. In that threat, Dominguez is accused of calling Trump sexist, racist and homophobic.  Rydalch said local and federal law enforcement treat all threats seriously, but there was no evidence Dominguez traveled anywhere to carry out his threats.  Dominguez, who was in custody ahead of a scheduled court appearance on Thursday afternoon, could not be reached for comment.  The federal indictment also charged him with using the police tip line in November and December to repeatedly threaten to injure people at a movie theater, conveying false information and threatening to harm police officers.  In all, Dominguez faces 11 criminal counts, each carrying a potential sentence of 10 years in prison, the  Department of Justice said.  In 2003, Dominguez pleaded guilty to charges of abusing an emergency telephone line and vehicle burglary, Utah television station KSL-TV reported, citing court records.

          "body": "* Dollar buoyant on strong US manufacturing, construction data  * Fed minutes also support dollar, seen as hawkish  * Dollar index pulls further away from 3-1/2-month low  * Greenback gains against safe-havens as risk assets rally  By Shinichi Saoshiro  TOKYO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The dollar extended gains on Thursday after upbeat U.S. data and supportive minutes from the Federal\u2019s Reserve\u2019s latest policy meeting helped it shake off recent weakness.  The dollar was 0.2 percent higher at 112.710 yen in early Asian trading. It touched a 2-1/2-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday after declining steadily from a high above 113.750 scaled in December.  The euro was 0.05 percent lower at $1.2011 after losing roughly 0.4 percent overnight. The common currency had surged to a three-month high of $1.2081 on Tuesday.  The dollar bounced after Wednesday\u2019s strong U.S. manufacturing and construction data.  It gained further support as the minutes from the Fed\u2019s Dec. 12-13 meeting were seen as more hawkish than anticipated, indicating the central bank is still poised to raise interest rates several times this year.  Fed policymakers acknowledged the U.S. labour market\u2019s solid gains and the expansion in economic activity, even as they affirmed policymakers\u2019 worries about persistently low inflation.  That suggested the central bank will continue to pursue a gradual approach in raising rates but could pick up the pace if inflation accelerates.  \u201cThe dollar did feel downward pressure at the turn of the year, but the selling was not based on very strong factors,\u201d said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  Rebalancing of positions caused by investors closing their books towards the turn of each year can lead to dollar selling.  \u201cAs such, strong U.S. data and the Fed\u2019s minutes, which suggested board members were not as pessimistic towards the potential economic impact of U.S. tax cuts as many in the market expected, helped the dollar get back on course,\u201d Yamamoto said.  Increasing investor risk appetite in broader markets also supported the dollar, notably against perceived safe-havens like the yen and Swiss franc, which was at 0.9776 franc per dollar after sliding 0.6 percent the previous day to pull back from a three-month peak of 0.9699.  Buoyed by overnight gains on Wall Street, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei began the first day of trading in 2018 by rallying more than 2 percent. Crude oil prices were at 2-1/2-year highs, helping fuel inflation expectations.  The pound dipped 0.1 percent to $1.3510, following overnight losses of 0.6 percent, when it fell back from a 3-1/2-month high of $1.3614 overnight against a rebounding dollar.  The Australian dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $0.7822 and the New Zealand dollar dipped 0.1 percent to $0.7085.  The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies extended the previous day\u2019s bounce to stand 0.1 percent higher at 92.248. It had declined to 91.751 on Tuesday, its lowest since Sep. 20. (Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro; editing by Richard Pullin)"

          "body": "(Repeats Jan 3 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.)  * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2CgLBYl  By John Kemp  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is sticking doggedly to its plan to cut commercial oil inventories down to the five-year average to rebalance the oil market.  But in doing so, the organisation risks tightening the market too much, sending prices sharply higher and encouraging a faster-than-expected acceleration in production from U.S. shale producers.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister, who is the organisation\u2019s de facto leader, has reiterated that stocks are still around 150 million barrels too high and it would be premature to discuss an exit strategy or change of course.  \u201cAlmost the single metric we look at is global inventories and of course the most transparent and trustworthy is the OECD,\u201d he said in an interview before Christmas (\u201cSaudi energy minister Q&A with Reuters\u201d, Dec. 20).  OPEC, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) all have slightly different figures for OECD commercial crude and products stocks, but they show a similar trend.  OPEC estimates that total stocks were around 137 million barrels higher than the five-year average in October, down by around half since May (\u201cMonthly Oil Market Report\u201d, OPEC, December 2017).  IEA puts commercial stocks about 111 million barrels above the prior five-year average at the end of October (\u201cOil Market Report\u201d, IEA, December 2017).  EIA data shows commercial stocks 167 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average at the end of October, down from a surplus of 380 million barrels in July 2016 (tmsnrt.rs/2CgLBYl).  While the specific numbers differ, mostly for definitional and methodological reasons, the data from each of the agencies shows the stock overhang compared with the five-year average has narrowed significantly.  Most of the remaining overhang is concentrated in crude oil rather than refined products such as gasoline and heating oil.  Product inventories are already tight in some cases, notably for middle distillates such as gasoil, diesel fuel and heating oil.  OPEC seems determined to drive total stocks down to the five-year average, or very close to it, before starting to increase its own output.  But that would almost certainly leave stockpiles uncomfortably low, send benchmark Brent prices well above $70 per barrel and push the market into a big backwardation.  Global oil consumption has increased by more 6 million barrels per day over the last five years, according to the EIA.  Other things equal, the oil industry will want to carry significantly higher stocks in 2018 than in 2013 to cover the increase in consumption.  Brent futures prices for the next six months are already trading in a backwardation of around $2 per barrel, which is consistent with a market that is already tight and undersupplied.  The six-month Brent calendar spread is trading around the 78th percentile of its historical range, up from the 22nd percentile at the same point last year.  The calendar spread is watched by many physical traders as the most reliable indicator of the balance between production, consumption and inventories.  Backwardation is normally associated with a market that is undersupplied and a low and declining level of inventories, while contango is normally associated with oversupply and high/rising stocks.  The Brent market has cycled regularly between backwardation and contango over the last 25 years as it moves between periods of under- and oversupply.  The sustained shift from contango in 2015/16 to backwardation in late 2017 and at the start of 2018 strongly suggests the market has switched from oversupply to undersupply.  Calendar spreads for all months in 2018 have tightened significantly over the last six months suggesting traders see the market moving towards a sustained period of undersupply.  Most forecasters, including the IEA and OPEC, predict the oil market will be in a small surplus during the first half of 2018, followed by a deficit in the second.  The expected rise in stocks during the first half is one reason why OPEC and its allies think market rebalancing will not be completed until later in the year and agreed to keep their output unchanged.  But a seasonal increase in stocks is normal during the first six months, which includes the principal maintenance period for many refineries.  Later in the year, the summer driving season in the United States and winter heating season in the northern hemisphere typically boost consumption in the second half.  Increasing crude stocks during the first half of 2018 would only signify a weakening market if stocks rise faster than normal.  History suggests that OPEC will gamble on tightening the market too much, with prices overshooting on the upside, rather than risk not tightening it enough and prices fall back.  After the past two oil market slumps, in 1997/98 and 2008/09, prices subsequently overshot the organisation\u2019s formal and informal targets of $28 and $75 per barrel respectively.  Front-month Brent futures prices reached almost $35 per barrel in late 2000 and more than $125 per barrel in early 2011.  The six-month calendar spread hit about $4.50 per barrel backwardation in both cases before starting to ease lower.  OPEC has not declared a price target for 2018, though some senior officials from member countries have briefed they want to see a Brent price floor of $60, which implies an annual average well above this.  In the past, OPEC members have tended to revise their price targets upwards as market prices rise, in a ratchet effect.  Re-running history, informal price targets, as implied in statements made by officials from OPEC members, have already risen significantly since the start of 2017.  Most OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, want to see higher oil prices to boost revenues and close their budget and current account deficits.  Saudi Arabia also needs higher prices to finance its ambitious social and economic transformation programme and create positive sentiment around the planned sale of shares in its national oil company.  In practice, if OPEC comes anywhere near achieving its objective of draining stocks down to the five-year average level, prices will likely end up well above $70, which will probably be welcomed by most OPEC members.  But the more prices increase, especially with Brent prices near $70, and WTI prices above $60, the more likely U.S. shale drilling and production rates will accelerate, which will tend to frustrate the objective of lowering stocks.

The raids were a sharp departure from practices during the presidency of Barack Obama.

Impoverished El Salvador has been plagued by a wave of violence attributed to the gangs, popularly known as \u201cmaras.\u201d  The government touted a 25 percent drop last year in homicides as a sign that its strategy to fight gangs is working, but it still has one of the highest murder rates in the world.

Despite recording back-to-back wins in Hawaii to start 2017, Thomas returns to the Pacific islands with a far higher profile, no longer regarded as a promising youngster since winning his first major and being crowned the PGA Tour Player of the Year.  Unable to move around freely in anonymity since that PGA Championship triumph in August, Thomas has sought the advice of his great friend and rival Jordan Spieth on how to cope with life in the spotlight.  \u201cI\u2019m going to be pulled a lot more ways than I was last year or the year prior, so I need to learn how to manage my time better and figure out what I need and don\u2019t need to do,\u201d he told reporters on the eve of the Sentry Tournament of Champions.  \u201cIt\u2019s just golf so I have to go out and do what I\u2019m doing and don\u2019t get affected by that stuff.\u201d  Thomas, who wants to improve his driving accuracy this year, returns to Kapalua on Maui as part of a loaded 34-man field restricted to winners on the 2017 PGA Tour.  The 24-year-old can expect to face a stern test of his credentials from a bunch of hungry rivals, including world number one Johnson, who is champing at the bit after what turned out to be a futile 2017 major campaign.  \u201cI\u2019d like to contend a bit better in the majors this year. Last year, I obviously got a little derailed before Augusta,\u201d he said, referring to the U.S. Masters, which he missed after falling down stairs and bruising his back on tournament eve.  Johnson did not get back into full stride until after the four majors were completed but he won a tour playoff event in late August and seems to have put the injury behind him.  \u201cThe swing\u2019s finally getting back to where it was and I\u2019m starting to hit the ball with the right shape, and hitting a lot more consistent shots,\u201d he said.  This week\u2019s field includes seven of the top eight in the world rankings \u2014 Johnson, Spieth, Thomas, Jon Rahm, Hideki Matsuyama, Rickie Fowler and Brooks Koepka.  Fowler enters as a recent winner after his runaway triumph at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas last month, a performance he hopes will be a springboard for more victories, rather than the near-misses he has become renowned for.  He also won the Honda Classic last year, while adding three runner-up finishes and a couple of thirds.  \u201cI would like to and should have won more last year,\u201d he acknowledged, adding that it was time to just get the job done.

          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Arkansas agricultural regulators stuck with a proposal on Wednesday to prohibit sprayings of a controversial weed killer after mid-April, despite a lawsuit over the plan by manufacturer Monsanto Co.  The state\u2019s plant board decided to move forward with a ban on the use of dicamba-based herbicides from April 16 to Oct. 31, after state lawmakers recommended last month that the panel review its recommendation.  The ban threatens to hurt demand for the products made by Monsanto and rival BASF SE because the chemicals are designed to be sprayed on dicamba-resistant crops during the summer growing season.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch banned clients from investing in one of bitcoin mogul Barry Silbert\u2019s top funds last month, according to a memo seen by Reuters.  As of Dec. 8, the Wall Street brokerage stopped approving new orders for the Bitcoin Investment Trust due to concerns about the \u201csuitability and eligibility standards of this product,\u201d according to the memo sent to roughly 17,000 brokers at Merrill Lynch and Merrill Edge, a unit for clients who manage their own trades.  Bitcoin Investment Trust is run by Grayscale Investments, which is led by Silbert. A former Wall Street investment banker and prominent supporter of cryptocurrencies, Silbert\u2019s role in the world of digital coins was the subject of a Reuters special report last month.  \u201cWe look forward to speaking with Merrill Lynch and addressing any questions or concerns they have about the Bitcoin Investment Trust,\u201d Silbert told Reuters in an email.\u00a0\u201cWe are unaware of any similar policies at other brokerage firms.\u201d  Wall Street has taken a cautious approach to digital currencies, which are unregulated and have very volatile trading patterns. Last month, Chicago-based derivatives exchanges Cboe Global Markets and the CME Group launched bitcoin futures, but some banks and brokerages remain reluctant to trade them.  Millions of investors have piled into bitcoin and other digital currencies prompting warnings of a bubble from the likes of JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has likened bitcoin to a \u201cfraud\u201d that will eventually blow up.  Shares in Bitcoin Investment Trust jumped over 1,550 percent last year, more than the 1,300 percent plus gain of bitcoin.  The fund was created for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin and trades \u201cover the counter\u201d in less formal exchanges than those used for typical stocks.  Before last month\u2019s ban, clients of Merrill Lynch\u2019s brokerage and Merrill Edge were able to buy stakes in Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trade at a fraction of a bitcoin. The digital currency is currently valued at around $15,000.  Merrill Lynch brokerage clients with historic positions in the Bitcoin Investment Trust fund can maintain them, but clients with fee-based advisory accounts have to sell their holdings, according to the memo.

          "body": "(Reuters) - The leader of the Mormon church, Thomas Monson, has died at his home in Salt Lake City, Utah, the church said on Wednesday. He was 90.   Monson became the 16th President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the religion is officially known, in 2008. As its leader, members of the faith considered him a prophet who received divine revelations.  The church said in a statement on its website that Monson died late on Tuesday.

The church, formally organized in 1830 in Upstate New York, has 15.9 million members worldwide, according to its website. They include the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.  \u201cPresident Monson had all the hallmarks of an unassuming servant of the Lord,\u201d the church said in the statement.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort sued Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Wednesday, alleging that his office\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia exceeds its legal authority.  The lawsuit could be the first legal test of how far Mueller\u2019s mandate extends, a question that is critical to his investigations into Manafort\u2019s and others\u2019 financial, real estate and other dealings.  Under the terms of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s order in May appointing Mueller, the special prosecutor not only can probe links or coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia but also can look into \u201cany matters that arose or may arise directly\u201d from the investigation.     Mueller\u2019s office indicted Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates in October on charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine\u2019s former pro-Russian government.          Manafort\u2019s civil lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accuses Rosenstein of exceeding his legal authority to \u201cgrant Mr. Mueller carte blanche to investigate and pursue criminal charges in connection with anything he stumbles across.\u201d  \u201cThe investigation has focused on Mr. Manafort\u2019s offshore business dealings that date back to as early as 2005 - about a decade before the Trump presidential campaign launched,\u201d the lawsuit said.   It added that Manafort voluntarily disclosed all of the information about his Ukraine work to the Justice Department in July 2014 as part of a since-closed investigation into stolen assets.  In addition to the indictments of Manafort and Gates, Mueller\u2019s office has secured guilty pleas for lying to the FBI from Trump\u2019s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign aide George Papadopoulos.  Both those cases, unlike the Manafort indictment, relate to Flynn and Papadopoulos\u2019 communications with Russians during their work for the Trump campaign.      Manafort\u2019s indictment made no reference to any activity related to his work on the Trump 2016 presidential campaign, and the lawsuit asked the court to \u201cset aside all actions\u201d taken so far against him.  A spokeswoman for the Justice Department called the lawsuit \u201cfrivolous,\u201d but added that Manafort was \u201centitled to file whatever he wants.\u201d  A spokesman for Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment.  Manafort\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Rosenstein\u2019s order tapping Mueller violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the government rulemaking process.  At issue is whether the scope of Rosenstein\u2019s order is too broad and runs afoul of the Justice Department\u2019s rules that establish procedures for hiring a special prosecutor.      Stephen Vladek, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said he thinks the lawsuit will fail due to procedural problems as well as on its merits. The case, he said, is a \u201clong shot.\u201d      Manafort\u2019s lawsuit comes as Trump and Republicans in Congress have escalated their attacks on Mueller, the FBI and the Justice Department by accusing them of political bias.  Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller in May shortly after Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey, told Congress last month that he does not think Mueller\u2019s investigation is tainted and sees no reason to have him removed.      Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia, although he has also said he fired Comey because of \u201cthis Russia thing.\u201d Moscow has denied meddling in the 2016 U.S. election campaign.

          "title": "Tesla pushes back Model 3 production target again, despite progress",
          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) delayed a production target for its new  Model 3 sedan for the second time on Wednesday, disappointing investors even as it claimed \u201cmajor progress\u201d overcoming manufacturing challenges that have hampered the vehicle\u2019s rollout.  The electric vehicle maker headed by Elon Musk said it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. Instead, Tesla said it now plans to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.  The delay sent shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company down 2 percent in after-market trading.  The Model 3 is critical to Tesla\u2019s long-term success, as it is the most affordable of its cars to date and is the only one capable of transforming the niche automaker to a mass producer amid a sea of rivals entering the nascent electric vehicle market.  Building the car efficiently and delivering it without delays to customers is also critical, as the money-losing company faces high cash burn. Delays increase the risk that reservation-holders will cancel orders.   \u201cThe further delay to (production volume) will leave analysts and investors focused on the implications for cash as we head through the first half of the year,\u201d Evercore analyst George Galliers told Reuters.  The company burned through $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in its third quarter and said in November that fourth-quarter capex would also be about $1.1 billion.   RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note that he did not believe Tesla will be required to do a capital raise.   \u201cWe have them hovering about $1 billion in cash ... They don\u2019t have a ton of wiggle room though in our view,\u201d Spak said.               In delivering 1,550 of its new Model 3 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, Tesla fell short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts had expected 4,100 Model 3 sedans to be delivered in the fourth quarter, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.  The estimates for Model 3 deliveries by different brokerages varied widely. While Evercore analysts estimated 5,800 deliveries, Cowen analysts expected just 2,250.  Tesla said 860 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the fourth quarter.  The company said it delivered a total of 29,870 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 15,200 Model S vehicles and 13,120 Model X cars. Analysts had expected total deliveries of about 30,000.  Tesla had initially predicted to reach the milestone of 5,000 vehicles per week in December, but in November deferred the target to the end of the first quarter.  Tesla said on Wednesday its production rate had increased significantly despite the delays.   \u201cIn the last seven working days of the quarter, we made 793 Model 3s, and in the last few days, we hit a production rate on each of our manufacturing lines that extrapolates to over 1,000 Model 3s per week,\u201d the company said in a statement.  That pace of production is still below that of many carmakers. A conventional car factory operating at full speed on two shifts can churn out nearly 1,000 vehicles a day.  The Model 3 - which starts at $35,000, or about half the price of its flagship Model S - was met with great enthusiasm when its prototype was first unveiled in early 2016. Tesla said in August it had about 500,000 reservations for the car and demand was not a constraint.  Production, however, hit snags during a period of \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d Musk first warned of in July. Among the issues Tesla faced was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, which required a redesign.  In its third quarter, Tesla built just 260 Model 3s.  Although bullish investors have generally waved off early Model 3 problems, instead focusing on the future prospects of Tesla, critics warn that Model 3 issues could sour demand for Tesla\u2019s mass-market vehicle, delay sorely needed revenue and compromise the company\u2019s ability to raise cash in the future.  Tesla shares, despite paring some gains from a high of $385 in September, still trade at 46 percent above their price a year ago.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Motel 6 was sued on Wednesday by Washington state\u2019s attorney general, who accused the discount hotel chain of illegally providing guest lists to U.S. immigration authorities, knowing of their interest in people with \u201cLatino-sounding\u201d names.  Attorney General Bob Ferguson said six Motel 6 locations in Washington provided names, birth dates, license plates and other personal information belonging to at least 9,151 guests to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from June 2015 to May 2017.  Ferguson said Motel 6 knew ICE used guest lists to target people based on their national origin, and that the disclosures led to detentions of at least six people.  Motel 6 is controlled by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), which bought the brand in 2012.  The chain\u2019s management company, G6 Hospitality, said it ordered its more than 1,400 U.S. and Canadian locations in September to stop voluntarily giving guest lists to ICE agents.  \u201cMotel 6 takes this matter very seriously, and we have and will continue to fully cooperate with the Office of the State Attorney General,\u201d G6 said in a statement on Wednesday.                                                                                             Ferguson said Motel 6\u2019s practices in Washington mirrored those in Arizona, citing a Sept. 13, 2017 report in the Phoenix New Times that ICE had arrested 20 people at Motel 6s there from February to August after getting similar tips.  He also said Motel 6 trained new employees to cooperate with ICE agents, despite a company policy of \u201csafeguarding the privacy of the personal information that we gather.\u201d  The lawsuit filed with the King County Superior Court in Seattle seeks an injunction against similar conduct, and civil fines of up to $2,000 per violation of state consumer protection and anti-discrimination laws.  \u201cMotel 6 implied this was a local problem,\u201d Ferguson, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cWe have found that is not true.\u201d  Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tom Brown"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Eight out of 10 grassroots members of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party want a referendum on the terms of the country\u2019s exit from the European Union, according to a survey published on Thursday.  That is at odds with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s official policy which calls for parliament, not the public, to have the final say on the terms of the deal.   It indicates a strong desire among the party\u2019s rank and file members for a chance to demand a rethink on Brexit, or even overturn the outcome of the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.  Eighteen months after voting 52 to 48 percent to withdraw from the EU, Britons remain deeply divided over leaving a bloc which has defined much of the country\u2019s laws, trade policy and international outlook over more than four decades of membership.      Theresa May\u2019s Conservative minority government has dismissed the idea of a second referendum.  But ministers have already been forced to give parliament a greater say in the Brexit process than they initially wanted to after members of May\u2019s own party rebelled on the issue in December.  Thursday\u2019s survey of attitudes within Britain\u2019s main political parties showed 49 percent of Labour members definitely wanted a second referendum on the exit deal and a further 29 percent said they were more in favour of the idea than against it.  The poll of more than 4,000 members of political parties was conducted shortly after last June\u2019s national election as part of a three-year academic project by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London to discover more about people who belong to political parties.  It showed even higher demand for a second vote on Brexit among members of the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party. By contrast, only 14 percent of Conservative Party members wanted a referendum on the exit deal.  Opinion polls measuring the views of the wider electorate show similar divisions over Brexit. In December, one survey showed 50 percent of voters supported a second referendum while 34 percent did not.  Labour\u2019s official stance on Brexit gained new significance after last year\u2019s general election saw them perform better than expected.

          "body": "LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 2 percent on Wednesday to the highest in 2-1/2 years, with buying spurred by a sixth day of unrest in OPEC member Iran and strong economic data from the United States and Germany.   U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled at $61.63 a barrel, up $1.26, or 2.1 percent.  International benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.27 a barrel, or 1.9 percent, to $67.84 a barrel.  During the session, WTI hit the highest since June 2015 while Brent touched its peak since May 2015.   After settlement, energy industry group the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. oil inventories fell by 5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 29. The U.S. Energy Department was scheduled to report official figures on oil inventories on Thursday.   The API said distillate stocks rose by 4.3 million barrels, more than expected. After the data, U.S. heating oil futures pared gains sharply. Heating oil had settled higher on the back of the cold weather hitting a large swathe of the United States.  Heating oil futures HOc1 settled at $2.0880 a gallon, up 1.4 percent. Cold weather on the East Coast has drawn a number of tankers carrying diesel and heating oil from Europe, reversing a traditional trade route.  Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards have deployed forces to three provinces to put down anti-government unrest, their commander said on Wednesday. Six days of protests have left 21 people dead.   \u201cWhile the Iran tensions are certainly a factor, the slew of remarkably strong economic data today is also forcing the rally,\u201d said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.  Germany\u2019s unemployment rate hit a record low in December, underpinning a broad-based economic upswing. U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, a further sign of strong economic momentum.   Manufacturing and construction reports also fuelled expectations for a robust U.S. economy in 2018.    Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark\u2019s Saxo Bank, warned that \u201cmultiple but temporary supply disruptions\u201d like the North Sea Forties and Libyan pipeline outages (and) protests across Iran ... helped create a record speculative long bet.\u201d  With pipeline outages resolved and protests in Iran showing no signs of affecting its oil production yet, Hansen said prices could fall in early 2018, especially with rising U.S. output.  \u201cIt is only a matter of time before the 10 million barrel per day (bpd) (U.S.) production target will be reached,\u201d Hansen said.  Supplies were healthy. U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has risen by almost 16 percent since the middle of 2016, hitting 9.75 million bpd at the end of last year.

          "body": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc said on Wednesday it and Teck Resources Ltd have taken higher stakes in the Fort Hills oil sands mine from partner Total SA, resolving a dispute over building costs.  Under terms of the deal, Suncor and Teck will fund more of the C$17 billion ($13.56 billion) project\u2019s capital cost - C$300 million and C$120 million more respectively. Suncor\u2019s share of the project will be 53.06 percent, compared to 20.89 percent for Teck and 26.05 percent for Total.  Calgary-based Suncor, Canada\u2019s second-largest energy producer, told investors last July it was in dispute with the French company, which had refused to provide any more funding for the massive project in northern Alberta.  \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to have reached this agreement and taken a bigger stake in what is arguably the best long-term growth project in our industry,\u201d Suncor chief executive Steve Williams said in a statement.  Fort Hills produced 6,000 barrels per day during fourth-quarter test runs and is expected to fully start production in mid-January when the first of three secondary extraction trains starts up, Suncor said.  The company had previously said it would produce first oil at Fort Hills by the end of 2017.  Once ramp-up operations are complete, Fort Hills will produce 190,000 barrels per day and Suncor expects the plant to reach 90 percent of capacity by year-end 2018.  The startup comes as increasing oil sands supply outpaces Canadian pipeline capacity, contributing to a deepening price discount for Canadian heavy crude compared to benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI).  Suncor produced 736,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2017, in line with record production in the previous quarter.

          "body": "* Ex-UK PM tells voters: This is your last chance to stop Brexit  * Blair says Brexit folly will make UK poorer and weaker  * Blair calls on Labour Party to oppose Brexit  By Guy Faulconbridge  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday warned voters that time was running out to reverse Brexit, a folly he said would torpedo Britain\u2019s remaining clout and be regretted for generations to come.  More than a year and a half since the 2016 Brexit vote, the United Kingdom remains deeply divided over the planned EU exit that Prime Minister Theresa May says will take place on March 29, 2019.  Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the divorce is Britain\u2019s most significant geopolitical move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the $2.5 trillion UK economy and its relation with the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc.  Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said Britain would be poorer, weaker and warned that May had solved none of the problems over Northern Ireland\u2019s post-Brexit status.  \u201cWe are making an error the contemporary world cannot understand and the generations of the future will not forgive,\u201d Blair said in an article published on his website on Thursday.  \u201c2018 will be the last chance to secure a say on whether the new relationship proposed with Europe is better than the existing one,\u201d Blair, 64, said.  Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: just over 15 years ago, British leaders such as Blair were arguing about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the reserve of sceptics on the fringes of both major parties.  But the turmoil of the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration and a series of miscalculations by former Prime Minister David Cameron prompted the United Kingdom to vote 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in a June 2016 referendum.  Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing other opponents of Brexit such as French President Emmanuel Macron and billionaire investor George Soros, who have suggested that Britain could still change its mind.  So far, opinion polls show little sign of a change of heart and it is unclear how Brexit could be stopped if both major political parties officially support the divorce.  Half of Britons support a second vote on whether to leave the European Union and a majority think the government may be paying too much money to the EU to open the way to trade talks, according to an opinion poll published last month.  Supporters of Brexit dismissed Blair and said he was undermining both the British negotiation and the will of the people.  \u201cBlair and his elitist gang are damaging our negotiating strength, thus damaging our national interest by their continuing efforts to undermine democracy,\u201d said Richard Tice, who helped found one of the two Leave campaign groups.  \u201cHistory will not forgive them,\u201d Tice told Reuters.  Blair is unpopular in Britain for his decision to back then-U.S. President George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq and the justification he used for going into a war that cost the deaths of 150,000 Iraqi civilians and 179 British soldiers.  But he has become increasingly outspoken about Brexit.  He implored his Labour Party, which is now led by socialist Jeremy Corbyn, to join the fight to stop Brexit.  \u201cMake Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100 percent,\u201d Blair said. \u201cIf Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the Single Market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour.\u201d  Editing by Robin Pomeroy"

          "title": "'Fat Cat Thursday' sees pay of top UK CEOs already pass annual average for workers",
          "body": "* Average FTSE 100 CEO has already earned 28,758 pounds  * Figure marks what typical worker earns in year  * Issue likely to be in focus in 2018 AGM season  By Simon Jessop  LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The average boss of one of Britain\u2019s top companies will on Thursday have earned the same as the typical worker will make in the entire year, according to a new report, stepping up pressure on companies ahead of the annual reporting season.  Just three working days into 2018, pay for the average FTSE 100 chief executive will pass the median worker salary of 28,758 pounds ($38,855), the report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and pressure group the High Pay Centre showed.  And that is despite the mean pay of FTSE 100 CEOs falling by about 17 percent in 2017 to 4.5 million pounds amid pressure from investors, the government and wider society for excessive pay to be reined in.  Even with that pay cut, the ratio of CEO pay to the pay of the average full-time worker is still 120:1, the report on \u201cFat Cat Thursday\u201d showed, with the best-paid boss - advertising company WPP\u2019s Martin Sorrell - on 48.2 million pounds.  \u201cThe drop in pay in the last year is welcome, although relatively marginal, and will have largely been driven by the growing public and shareholder concerns and the Prime Minister\u2019s stronger focus on boardroom excess and plans to reform corporate governance,\u201d CIPD Chief Executive Peter Cheese said.  After a high-profile government review of the UK Corporate Governance Code in 2017, Britain\u2019s leading companies will now be forced to disclose the pay ratio between the CEO and average worker, a move welcomed by the High Pay Centre\u2019s Stefan Stern.  \u201cPublishing pay ratios will force boards to acknowledge these gaps. We look forward to working with business and government to make this new disclosure requirement work as effectively as possible,\u201d he said.  Luke Hildyard, Stewardship and Corporate Governance Policy Lead at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said just 7 percent of FTSE 100 annual reports detailed the difference between the CEO\u2019s pay and that of the wider workforce.  \u201cHuge pay differences between executives and the wider workforce symbolise how too many companies fail to understand or appreciate the value of their workers,\u201d he said.  $1 = 0.7401 pounds\nReporting by Simon Jessop; Editing by Mark Potter"

          "title": "Bellerin earns Arsenal 2-2 draw in Chelsea derby classic",
          "body": "(Reuters) - - Arsenal and Chelsea made a mockery of talk of player fatigue at the end of a festive slog of Premier League action as Hector Bellerin\u2019s stoppage-time stunner earned the hosts a 2-2 draw in a scintillating derby on Wednesday.  From beginning to end at the Emirates Stadium, both sides traded chances with Arsenal keeper Petr Cech and his opposite number Thibaut Courtois responsible for keeping the scoresheet blank until past the hour mark.  Jack Wilshere gave Arsenal a 63rd-minute lead but Bellerin\u2019s trip on Eden Hazard gave the Belgian wizard the chance to level from the penalty spot four minutes later.  A flowing Chelsea move ended with Marcos Alonso putting the visitors ahead in the 84th minute but they were denied the victory that would have put them above Manchester United into second spot with Bellerin\u2019s sumptuous 92nd minute half-volley.  There was still time for Chelsea substitute Davide Zappacosta to hit the crossbar but defeat would have been harsh on Arsenal who had 14 goal attempts to Chelsea\u2019s 19.  Chelsea remained in third place with 46 points, 16 behind leaders Manchester City, who have a 15-point lead over second-placed Manchester United, while Arsenal stayed sixth.  It was manager Arsene Wenger\u2019s 60th match against Chelsea in his long Arsenal reign but few could have provided as much goalmouth action as this classic.  \u201cIt was a fantastic football game and overall it could have gone both ways,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a fair result.  \u201cThe penalty was a farcical decision. When we looked as though maybe mentally we were shot, we had the resources to come back to 2-2.\u201d  Alvaro Morata, strangely profligate all night, wasted a great chance early on for Chelsea when he took advantage of a yawning chasm in the Arsenal defense to go through on goal but his sidefoot finish was dreadful.  At the other end Alexis Sanchez\u2019s shot struck both uprights after a superb save by Courtois who shortly afterwards did brilliantly to keep out Alexandre Lacazette\u2019s shot.  Tiemoue Bakayoko and Cesc Fabregas both wasted chances for Chelsea while Mesut Ozil drew a fine save from Courtois.  Former Chelsea stopper Cech, seeking a 200th Premier League clean sheet, showed his class to deny Hazard as the second half began with another flurry of attacks.  Not to be outdone, Courtois then blocked Sanchez\u2019s powerful close-range effort after the Chilean\u2019s sublime piece of trickery.  Wilshere finally beat Courtois, the midfielder lashing a left-foot shot high into the top corner on the stretch after a deflected pass found him at the far post.  Arsenal were buoyant but were flattened four minutes later when Bellerin dangled a leg and Hazard went down theatrically \u2014 much to the annoyance of Wenger, whose side were denied victory at West Bromwich Albion by a late penalty on Sunday.  Hazard sent Cech the wrong way from the spot.  A sweeping crossfield move in the 84th minute saw Zappacosta get the better of Arsenal\u2019s inexperienced left back Ainsley Maitland-Niles before rifling in a low cross that Alonso met sweetly to give Cech no chance.  To their credit Arsenal refused to accept defeat and when Alonso failed to get proper distance on a clearing header the ball feel for Bellerin to send a half-volley curling away from the helpless Courtois.  Morata spurned another one-on-one before Zappacosta\u2019s dipper cannoned against the crossbar to leave honors even to the frustration of Chelsea manager Antonio Conte.  \u201cI think it is a pity because when you have so many chances to score you must win the game,\u201d said Conte.

          "body": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc said on Wednesday it and Teck Resources Ltd have taken higher stakes in the Fort Hills oil sands mine from partner Total SA, resolving a dispute over building costs.  Under terms of the deal, Suncor and Teck will fund more of the C$17 billion ($13.56 billion) project\u2019s capital cost - C$300 million and C$120 million more respectively. Suncor\u2019s share of the project will be 53.06 percent, compared to 20.89 percent for Teck and 26.05 percent for Total.  Calgary-based Suncor, Canada\u2019s second-largest energy producer, told investors last July it was in dispute with the French company, which had refused to provide any more funding for the massive project in northern Alberta.  \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to have reached this agreement and taken a bigger stake in what is arguably the best long-term growth project in our industry,\u201d Suncor chief executive Steve Williams said in a statement.  Fort Hills produced 6,000 barrels per day during fourth-quarter test runs and is expected to fully start production in mid-January when the first of three secondary extraction trains starts up, Suncor said.  The company had previously said it would produce first oil at Fort Hills by the end of 2017.  Once ramp-up operations are complete, Fort Hills will produce 190,000 barrels per day and Suncor expects the plant to reach 90 percent of capacity by year-end 2018.  The startup comes as increasing oil sands supply outpaces Canadian pipeline capacity, contributing to a deepening price discount for Canadian heavy crude compared to benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI).  Suncor produced 736,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2017, in line with record production in the previous quarter.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Jack Wilshere can reclaim his place in the England squad for this year\u2019s World Cup, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said after the midfielder ended a more than two-year wait for a top-flight goal on Wednesday.  The injury-plagued 26-year-old midfielder, who last played for England in the humiliating defeat by Iceland at Euro 2016 and was loaned out to Bournemouth last season, opened the scoring in the 2-2 draw with Chelsea.  His finish, a thumping left-foot effort that flew past Thibaut Courtois and in off the post in the 63rd minute, continued a return to form for Wilshere whose last Premier League goal was in May ,2015.  Wilshere suffered a broken leg playing for Bournemouth in April and was a fringe player at Arsenal this season after recovering, but has started the last five league games.  \u201cI think he is at the level now where not many people expected him to be,\u201d Wenger, who recently said he would allow Wilshere to leave to gain first-team football, told reporters.  \u201cWhen was the last time he played for England? Exactly, against Iceland (at Euro 2016), he came on. Since he has not played for England and I would say that means that everybody had given up on him.  \u201cToday, nobody would be surprised if he was selected again. I think first of all he deserves a great credit for remarkable strength and we do as well.\u201d  Wilsheres\u2019s goal ended a 43-match run of Premier League games without one, although he was perhaps lucky to still be on the pitch after escaping a second yellow card for an apparent dive in the second half.  \u201cFair to say I enjoyed that!\u201d Wilshere said on Twitter and judging by the Arsenal fans\u2019 reaction they also are delighted to see a player who was once tipped for the very top back to something approaching his best form.  The key now for Wilshere is to maintain his form for Arsenal and, most importantly, stay injury-free in a bid to convince England manager Gareth Southgate that he is worthy of seat on the plane to Russia in the summer.  Although his priority is trying to get Arsenal back into the top four having slipped to sixth.  \u201cI\u2019ve just got to keep working and take each game as they come I\u2019m happy and I\u2019ve said it before, I just want to be playing games, I missed it so much going out on loan, I just want to be an Arsenal player,\u201d Wilshere said.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Motel 6 was sued on Wednesday by Washington state\u2019s attorney general, who accused the discount hotel chain of illegally providing guest lists to U.S. immigration authorities, knowing of their interest in people with \u201cLatino-sounding\u201d names.  Attorney General Bob Ferguson said six Motel 6 locations in Washington provided names, birth dates, license plates and other personal information belonging to at least 9,151 guests to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from June 2015 to May 2017.  Ferguson said Motel 6 knew ICE used guest lists to target people based on their national origin, and that the disclosures led to detentions of at least six people.  Motel 6 is controlled by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), which bought the brand in 2012.  The chain\u2019s management company, G6 Hospitality, said it ordered its more than 1,400 U.S. and Canadian locations in September to stop voluntarily giving guest lists to ICE agents.  \u201cMotel 6 takes this matter very seriously, and we have and will continue to fully cooperate with the Office of the State Attorney General,\u201d G6 said in a statement on Wednesday.                                                                                             Ferguson said Motel 6\u2019s practices in Washington mirrored those in Arizona, citing a Sept. 13, 2017 report in the Phoenix New Times that ICE had arrested 20 people at Motel 6s there from February to August after getting similar tips.  He also said Motel 6 trained new employees to cooperate with ICE agents, despite a company policy of \u201csafeguarding the privacy of the personal information that we gather.\u201d  The lawsuit filed with the King County Superior Court in Seattle seeks an injunction against similar conduct, and civil fines of up to $2,000 per violation of state consumer protection and anti-discrimination laws.  \u201cMotel 6 implied this was a local problem,\u201d Ferguson, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cWe have found that is not true.\u201d  Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tom Brown"

          "body": "WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The judge overseeing the bankruptcy of Takata Corp\u2019s TKTDQ.PK U.S. unit on Wednesday cleared the way for the company\u2019s creditors to vote on its Chapter 11 plan, which critics say limits the legal rights of those injured by its deadly airbags.  Takata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June after more than 100 million of its airbags were recalled because they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments.  The airbags have been linked to at least 180 injuries and 18 deaths, including one in Louisiana that was identified last month.   During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, the judge reviewed the adequacy of TK Holdings\u2019 disclosures, which attempt to summarize and translate the dense legalese of the company\u2019s proposed reorganization plan.   Critics have said the plan favors automakers over car owners. They used the hearing to test arguments that could be raised again at a Feb. 13 confirmation hearing, when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon in Wilmington, Delaware, will decide if the plan is fair and meets other requirements.  Shannon raised the possibility on Wednesday that he might not approve a proposal contained in the reorganization plan to establish a fund to compensate those with personal injury claims caused by airbags in vehicles made by Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T).   The trust would pay compensation based on the injury, ranging from $10,000 for bruising to $5 million for death or loss of eyesight, according to court documents.   Car owners would be barred from suing Honda and other car makers could opt to join the trust arrangement.  Sander Esserman, a lawyer representing car owners seeking to recover costs related to the recall, criticized the trust proposal because it limited the rights of consumers by barring punitive damages and paying compensation in installments.  Honda\u2019s attorney, Jessica Boelter of Sidley Austin, said the company was owed $9.4 billion from the recall, which she said was the biggest claim of any automaker.   Takata plans to sell its viable operations to Key Safety Systems, an affiliate of China\u2019s Ningo Joyson Electric Corp (600699.SS), for $1.6 billion. The proceeds will fund restitution claims for automakers and help pay personal injury and wrongful death claims.  Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Del.; Editing by Matthew Lewis"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Antonio Conte defended Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata after the Spaniard missed three one-on-one chances which cost his side victory over Arsenal in the Premier League on Wednesday.  The Blues drew 2-2 at the Emirates but Morata fluffed his lines in front of goal, twice firing off target when clean through and then at Petr Cech in stoppage time.  Morata has 10 Premier League goals in 19 appearances since joining from Real Madrid last year, but after failing to find the net with simple chances against Stoke City in Chelsea\u2019s 5-0 win on Saturday he has not enjoyed the festive season.  \u201cIt is not a lucky period for him,\u201d Conte told a news conference. \u201cIn the last game against Stoke I said it was important for the striker to have chances to score.  \u201cToday he had chances but this is football. I\u2019m happy with his commitment, he worked hard for the team and they are the most important things for me.  \u201cFor the striker it\u2019s very important to score and in this case your confidence can go down. He\u2019s very young, he has to continue to work, continue to improve. The goal is coming.\u201d  Morata, 25, fired well wide when sent through on goal early in the match.  Arsenal took the lead through Jack Wilshere but Eden Hazard\u2019s penalty and Marcos Alonso put the Blues in front before Hector Bellerin equalized in stoppage time.  Morata should have given Chelsea a last-gasp winner but Cech saved his effort when he only had the goalkeeper to beat before Davide Zappacosta crashed a shot against the crossbar.  A disbelieving Conte beat the turf in frustration, admitting the wasted chances cost third-placed Chelsea as they try to catch runaway leaders Manchester City.  \u201cTo draw at the Emirates is a good result,\u201d added the Italian. \u201c(But) at the end of the game if we see the chances we created to score, for sure I think we dropped two points.\u201d  Reporting by Rik Sharma, editing by Ed Osmond"

          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Monsanto Co has won support from eleven U.S. states in its attempt to stop California from requiring cancer warnings on products containing glyphosate, ratcheting up a legal fight over the company\u2019s popular weed killer.    Missouri, home to Monsanto\u2019s headquarters, along with other farm states including Iowa and Indiana, said in court documents on Tuesday that the warnings would be misleading because there is no definite link between glyphosate and cancer.  Midwest businesses would need to include warnings on glyphosate products if California requires them or stop selling such goods because they may end up in the Golden State, according to the states\u2019 filing.  California added glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto\u2019s Roundup herbicide, to its list of cancer-causing chemicals in July 2017 and will require products containing the chemical to carry warnings by July 2018.  The state acted after the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded in 2015 that glyphosate was \u201cprobably carcinogenic.\u201d  \u201cThe mandate imposes confusing and potentially inconsistent obligations on non-resident businesses, creating a strong incentive to abandon glyphosate markets altogether,\u201d the states\u2019 filing said.  For more than 40 years, farmers have applied glyphosate to crops, most recently on soybeans that Monsanto genetically engineered to resist the herbicide. Roundup is also sprayed on residential lawns and golf courses.  The controversy in California is a headache for the company as it faces a crisis around another herbicide based on a chemical known as dicamba that has been linked to U.S. crop damage.  Monsanto, which is being acquired by Bayer AG for $63.5 billion, developed the dicamba-based product following an increase in weeds resistant to glyphosate.  The 11 states are supporting a federal lawsuit Monsanto, the National Association of Wheat Growers and other agricultural groups filed in November to stop the state from requiring glyphosate warnings.      Monsanto said Wednesday it had discussed California\u2019s mandate with officials in agricultural states as it proceeded with the lawsuit.  California\u2019s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), which is named in the lawsuit, declined to comment. The office previously said it stands by the decision to include glyphosate on the state\u2019s list of products known to cause cancer, as required under a rule known as Proposition 65.  \u201cProposition 65 is 30 years old and for every one of those years there have been strenuous attempts to kill it on the ground that it\u2019s different from other states,\u201d said David Roe, the rule\u2019s primary author.   \u201cThey\u2019ve always failed.\u201d  Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Matthew Lewis"

Stocks added slightly to gains late, with some support from minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s last policy meeting showing the U.S. central bank would likely stick to gradual interest rate hikes this year.  \u201cThey reiterated gradual rate increases, so that\u2019s steady as she goes, which the stock market seems to like,\u201d said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  Earlier in the session, data showed U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, a sign of economic momentum at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy.  For technology stocks, Alphabet Inc, IBM and chipmakers were among the biggest drivers. The S&P 500 tech index, the best-performing S&P sector in 2017 with a 37 percent jump, ended the day up 1.1 percent.  U.S. chipmaker stocks surged for a second straight session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 1.7 percent in its strongest two-day performance since June 2016.  \u201cThe (recent) selloff in tech stocks may have made that group look attractive today given that there\u2019s still significant growth potential there both short term and long term,\u201d Hellwig said.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,922.68, the S&P 500 gained 17.25 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,713.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.63 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,065.53.  The Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX and a popular options-based gauge of expected near-term price volatility, closed at 9.15, just shy of its record low close of 9.14 on Nov. 3.  Gains in energy and healthcare also boosted the market. The S&P energy index gained 1.5 percent while S&P healthcare rose 1 percent.  Intel Corp ended down 3.4 percent. The company acknowledged a report that a design flaw in its chips could let hackers steal data but said it was working on a solution that would not significantly slow computers.  Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices climbed 5.2 percent. Nvidia Corp gained 6.6 percent and Micron Technology Inc rose 3 percent.  Oracle Crop shares were up 2.3 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the business software maker.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  About 7.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

          "title": "Air pollution around conception tied to birth defects",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - Women who breathe polluted air during the month right before or after they get pregnant may be more likely to have babies with birth defects, a U.S. recent study suggests.   Researchers examined data on birth defects for almost 290,000 infants born in Ohio from 2006 to 2010, matching these records with air pollution measurements near mothers\u2019 homes.   They focused on what\u2019s known as fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter that\u2019s found in traffic exhaust and can include dust, dirt, soot, and smoke.   Higher levels of PM 2.5 exposure in the month before and after pregnancy were associated with a small but statistically meaningful increased risk of congenital birth defects, the study found.   \u201cOur study indicates that there are several particularly vulnerable exposure periods near the time of conception, both before and after conception, in which exposure to higher levels of particulate matter in the air may pose an increased chance for a birth defect to occur,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Emily DeFranco of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in Ohio.   The impact of particulate matter on birth defects varied based on how far women lived from air quality monitoring stations.   Overall, when researchers looked at every mother in the study, women were exposed to average PM 2.5 levels of 13.79 micrograms per cubic meter of air (ug/m3) during the months just before and after they conceived. This included women who lived within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of an air quality monitoring station.   When researchers looked at a subset of women who lived within 5 kilometers of a monitoring station, they found that for every 10 ug/m3 increase in PM 2.5 levels women experienced during the month after conception, their babies were 19 percent more to be born with birth defects.  Certain types of birth defects appeared more strongly connected to air pollution, including abdominal malformations and what\u2019s known as hypospadias, an abnormality in boys that occurs when the opening of the urethra doesn\u2019t develop on the tip of the penis and instead forms on the shaft or on the scrotum.   At the time of the study, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standard for particulate matter levels was 15 ug/m3, while the current standard is 12 ug/m3, researchers note in the Journal of Pediatrics.   \u201cOur study results support the importance of public health education and initiatives to minimize population exposure to airborne pollutants,\u201d DeFranco said.   The study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how mothers\u2019 exposure to air pollution might influence the odds of birth defects in their babies. The study also only examined air pollution near women\u2019s homes, and not necessarily near where they worked or spent the most time outdoors.   Even so, it makes sense for women to limit their exposure to air pollution whenever possible whether by avoiding outdoor commutes during rush hour or concentrating on indoor air quality, said Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, an environmental health researcher at Boston University who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   \u201cIf you live in areas of the world with high levels of ambient air pollution, you may consider installing appropriate air or ventilation systems so that your in-home air quality is excellent,\u201d Mahalingaiah advised. \u201cIdeally, working together with policy makers, companies, and nations to reduce emissions and innovate around sequestering current levels of emissions would be a goal.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2E47lqR Journal of Pediatrics, online December 10, 2017.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Genworth Financial Inc (GNW.N) said on Wednesday it was pressing forward on its deal to be acquired by China\u2019s Oceanwide Holdings Co Ltd (000046.SZ), which has stalled over concerns about Chinese access to sensitive U.S. personal data and faced renewed doubts after the collapse of Ant Financial\u2019s proposed purchase of MoneyGram.  Genworth said it and Oceanwide are working to amend the proposed deal in hopes of winning approval from a U.S. national security panel.  On Tuesday China\u2019s Ant Financial said it scrapped plans to buy MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) because the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) rejected it.

The two deals are among many facing CFIUS\u2019s changing standards for deal approval as the United States has become increasingly skeptical of Chinese investment.

          "title": "Monsanto wins support from 11 U.S. states in California cancer dispute",
          "body": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Monsanto Co has won support from eleven U.S. states in its attempt to stop California from requiring cancer warnings on products containing glyphosate, ratcheting up a legal fight over the company\u2019s popular weed killer.    Missouri, home to Monsanto\u2019s headquarters, along with other farm states including Iowa and Indiana, said in court documents on Tuesday that the warnings would be misleading because there is no definite link between glyphosate and cancer.  Midwest businesses would need to include warnings on glyphosate products if California requires them or stop selling such goods because they may end up in the Golden State, according to the states\u2019 filing.  California added glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto\u2019s Roundup herbicide, to its list of cancer-causing chemicals in July 2017 and will require products containing the chemical to carry warnings by July 2018.  The state acted after the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded in 2015 that glyphosate was \u201cprobably carcinogenic.\u201d  \u201cThe mandate imposes confusing and potentially inconsistent obligations on non-resident businesses, creating a strong incentive to abandon glyphosate markets altogether,\u201d the states\u2019 filing said.  For more than 40 years, farmers have applied glyphosate to crops, most recently on soybeans that Monsanto genetically engineered to resist the herbicide. Roundup is also sprayed on residential lawns and golf courses.  The controversy in California is a headache for the company as it faces a crisis around another herbicide based on a chemical known as dicamba that has been linked to U.S. crop damage.  Monsanto, which is being acquired by Bayer AG for $63.5 billion, developed the dicamba-based product following an increase in weeds resistant to glyphosate.  The 11 states are supporting a federal lawsuit Monsanto, the National Association of Wheat Growers and other agricultural groups filed in November to stop the state from requiring glyphosate warnings.      Monsanto said Wednesday it had discussed California\u2019s mandate with officials in agricultural states as it proceeded with the lawsuit.  California\u2019s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), which is named in the lawsuit, declined to comment. The office previously said it stands by the decision to include glyphosate on the state\u2019s list of products known to cause cancer, as required under a rule known as Proposition 65.  \u201cProposition 65 is 30 years old and for every one of those years there have been strenuous attempts to kill it on the ground that it\u2019s different from other states,\u201d said David Roe, the rule\u2019s primary author.   \u201cThey\u2019ve always failed.\u201d  Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Matthew Lewis"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration should encourage U.S. technology companies to provide communication services to Iranians as they protest their country\u2019s clerical rulers, said Reza Pahlavi, the last heir to the Iranian monarchy.   In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Pahlavi also criticized the Trump administration\u2019s ban on travel to the United States by most Iranians, calling it \u201cridiculous\u201d.  Anti-government protests have gripped Iran for nearly a week in the most sustained challenge to the Islamic Republic\u2019s clerical elite in almost a decade.      Pahlavi has lived in exile for nearly four decades, since his father, the U.S.-backed shah, was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  The opposition to Iran\u2019s clerical government is atomized, with no clear recognized leader. But some demonstrators have in recent days chanted slogans in favor of Pahlavi\u2019s grandfather, Reza Shah, breaking a longstanding taboo.  Pahlavi said he wants to see Iranians \u201cdetermine their own fate out of their own free will,\u201d and praised U.S. President Donald Trump and members of his cabinet for speaking in support of Iranian protesters.  But he said they also should take steps to ensure that Iranians have access to communication and social media tools, which they have used to share videos and messages documenting protests and clashes with security forces.  Iran, which bars the use of major social media platforms, also has restricted access to the Telegram messaging app, and Iranian users in recent days have reported major hurdles in accessing the internet.  \u201cWe need more than lip service. We need to see concrete actions,\u201d Pahlavi said. \u201cThis has to be immediate ... As we speak, the regime is attempting yet again to try to shut down whatever it is, whether it\u2019s Instagram or Telegram.\u201d  There is a precedent for this type of U.S. intervention. In 2009, amid mass protests over a disputed election, an Obama administration official asked Twitter executives to delay scheduled maintenance so Iranians could continue to use the service to communicate.  Technology experts have documented numerous examples of commercial services being denied to Iranians, often because of concerns about running afoul of U.S. sanctions.  Activists have urged tech companies to loosen their Iran policies, but say the Trump administration could expand exemptions to make clear that some services are allowed.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a news briefing on Tuesday that the United States wants to see Iranians have access to social media and other tools. But when asked if Google was \u201cover-interpreting\u201d U.S. sanctions on Iran by blocking access to one of its services there, Nauert said she had \u201cno idea.\u201d  Asked if the State Department is urging tech companies to do more to ensure access for Iranians, a State Department spokeswoman did not answer directly but said U.S. support for the free flow of information to Iranians \u201cis a key element of the President\u2019s new U.S. strategy for Iran.\u201d    The Obama administration approved exemptions to U.S. sanctions that allowed for providing chat, email, social networking, photo sharing, web browsing, blogging and other personal communication services.  Twitter and messaging service Signal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook and Google declined to comment.  \u201cThe policies of these companies are not really clear,\u201d said Amir Rashidi, an internet security researcher at the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a non-governmental organization based in New York.  Pahlavi critiqued the Trump administration\u2019s decision to ban nearly all Iranian travelers and immigrants from the United States as part of a broader travel ban targeting several mostly Muslim countries.  \u201cIranian diplomats still can travel (here) but innocent Iranians who in fact work and have built this country are barred from coming,\u201d said Pahlavi, who lives in the United States. \u201cWhy? Because they\u2019re under the so-called ban. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d  A State Department spokeswoman said U.S. support for the Iranian people \u201cis a fundamentally separate issue\u201d from the travel ban.

          "title": "Iran deploys Revolutionary Guards to quell 'sedition' in protest hotbeds",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards have deployed forces to three provinces to put down anti-government unrest after six days of protests that have rattled the clerical leadership and left 21 people dead.  The protests, which began last week over economic hardships suffered by the young and working class, have evolved into a rising against the powers and privileges of a remote elite, especially supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.   The unrest continued to draw sharply varied responses internationally, with Europeans expressing unease at the delighted reaction by U.S. and Israeli leaders to the display of opposition to Iran\u2019s clerical establishment.  Defying threats from the judiciary of execution if convicted of rioting, protests resumed after nightfall with hundreds hitting the streets of Malayer in Hamadan province chanting: \u201cPeople are begging, the supreme leader is acting like God!\u201d  Videos carried by social media showed protesters in the northern town of Nowshahr shouting \u201cdeath to the dictator\u201d.  In a sign of official concern about the resilience of the protests, the Revolutionary Guards commander, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said he had dispatched forces to Hamadan, Isfahan and Lorestan provinces to tackle \u201cthe new sedition\u201d.       Most of the casualties among protesters have occurred in those regions of the sprawling Islamic Republic.   The Revolutionary Guards, the sword and shield of Iran\u2019s Shi\u2019ite theocracy, were instrumental in suppressing an uprising over alleged election fraud in 2009 in which dozens of mainly middle-class protesters were killed. Khamenei condemned that unrest as \u201csedition\u201d.   In Washington, a senior Trump administration official said the United States aimed to collect \u201cactionable information\u201d that could allow it to pursue sanctions against Iranian individuals and organizations involved in the crackdown.  But in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron said the tone of comments from the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia was \u201calmost one that would lead us to war ... a deliberate strategy for some,\u201d and stressed the importance of keeping a dialogue with Tehran.  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel expressed concern about the situation escalating.  \u201cWhat we urgently advise against is the attempt to abuse this internal Iranian conflict ... internationally. That is not going to ease the situation any way,\u201d he said.  In a state-sponsored show of force aimed at countering the outpouring of dissent, thousands of Iranians took part in pro-government rallies in several cities on Wednesday morning.  State television broadcast live footage of rallies where marchers waved Iranian flags and portraits of Khamenei, Iran\u2019s paramount leader since 1989.  Pro-government marchers chanted: \u201cThe blood in our veins is a gift to our leader (Khamenei),\u201d and: \u201cWe will not leave our leader alone.\u201d They accused the United States, Israel and Britain of inciting protests, shouting, \u201cThe seditionist rioters should be executed!\u201d  In the Shi\u2019ite holy city of Qom, demonstrators chanted \u201cdeath to American mercenaries\u201d. On Tuesday, the 78-year-old Khamenei had accused Iran\u2019s adversaries of fomenting the protests.  Jafari, the Revolutionary Guards commander, said the pro-government rallies marked an end to protests that he said \u201cwere a maximum of 1,500 people in each place, and the number of troublemakers did not exceed 15,000 people nationwide.\u201d   RARE ANTI-GOVERNMENT OUTPOURING  U.S. President Donald Trump, who has sought to isolate the Tehran leadership, reversing the conciliatory approach of predecessor Barack Obama, said Washington would throw its support behind the protesters at a suitable time.  \u201cSuch respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government. You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!\u201d Trump wrote in the latest of a series of tweets on Iran\u2019s turmoil.  In contrast, the leader of Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah group, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, played down the protests as economic discontent, saying they were not rooted in the political issues which spurred huge numbers to demonstrate in 2009 and would end soon.   He described them as \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d.  The protests seem to be spontaneous, without a clear leader, cropping up in working-class neighborhoods and smaller cities, but the movement seems to be gaining traction among the educated middle class and activists who took part in the 2009 protests.  More than 100 Iranian woman activists voiced support for a new uprising in a statement on Wednesday. Several prominent Iranian lawyers, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, urged Tehran to respect people\u2019s right to freedom of assembly and expression, guaranteed under the constitution.  Some labor unions as well as minority Kurdish opposition groups have also thrown their weight behind the protests.  In Geneva, the U.N. human rights chief urged Iran to rein in security forces to avoid further violence and respect the right to peaceful assembly.  Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, called for \u201cthorough, independent and impartial investigations of all acts of violence\u201d.  Hamidreza Abolhassani, a regional judicial official, said a European citizen had been arrested for leading rioters in the Borujerd area of western Iran and was suspected of having been \u201ctrained by European intelligence services\u201d. The detainee\u2019s nationality was not given.  The protests have heaped pressure on President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who championed a deal struck with world powers in 2015 to curb Iran\u2019s disputed nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions.  Many of the protesters are fuming over what they see as the failure so far of Rouhani\u2019s government to deliver on promises of more jobs and investment as a dividend of the nuclear accord.  Anger over economic stagnation and reputed graft within the clerical and security hierarchies has been building since last month. Thousands joined a hashtag campaign on Twitter and other sites to vent frustration over the dragging pace of reforms to tackle high unemployment and grant more social freedoms.  Khamenei and Rouhani have vowed to crack down on high-level corruption and create economic prosperity for all Iranians.   But there have been few changes. The Revolutionary Guards, for example, still control a vast, lucrative economic empire.   While more than 20 million out of 80 million Iranians live below the poverty line, the wealthy, including relatives of government officials, import tens of thousands of luxury cars every year.  Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports under terms of the nuclear deal he opposed. But if re-imposes sanctions, he risks worsening the economic pain of Iranians he has vowed to help.  \u201cIf the Americans\u2019 sympathy with Iranians were real, they would have not imposed cruel sanctions on the our nation,\u201d Jafari, the Revolutionary Guards commander, said on Wednesday.

In 2009, amid mass protests over a disputed election, an Obama administration official asked Twitter executives to delay scheduled maintenance so Iranians could continue to use the service to communicate.  Technology experts have documented numerous examples of commercial services being denied to Iranians, often because of concerns about running afoul of U.S. sanctions.  Activists have urged tech companies to loosen their Iran policies, but say the Trump administration could expand exemptions to make clear that some services are allowed.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a news briefing on Tuesday that the United States wants to see Iranians have access to social media and other tools. But when asked if Google was \u201cover-interpreting\u201d U.S. sanctions on Iran by blocking access to one of its services there, Nauert said she had \u201cno idea.\u201d  Asked if the State Department is urging tech companies to do more to ensure access for Iranians, a State Department spokeswoman did not answer directly but said U.S. support for the free flow of information to Iranians \u201cis a key element of the President\u2019s new U.S. strategy for Iran.\u201d    The Obama administration approved exemptions to U.S. sanctions that allowed for providing chat, email, social networking, photo sharing, web browsing, blogging and other personal communication services.  Twitter and messaging service Signal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook and Google declined to comment.  \u201cThe policies of these companies are not really clear,\u201d said Amir Rashidi, an internet security researcher at the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a non-governmental organization based in New York.  Pahlavi critiqued the Trump administration\u2019s decision to ban nearly all Iranian travelers and immigrants from the United States as part of a broader travel ban targeting several mostly Muslim countries.  \u201cIranian diplomats still can travel (here) but innocent Iranians who in fact work and have built this country are barred from coming,\u201d said Pahlavi, who lives in the United States. \u201cWhy? Because they\u2019re under the so-called ban. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d  A State Department spokeswoman said U.S. support for the Iranian people \u201cis a fundamentally separate issue\u201d from the travel ban.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Top seed Dominic Thiem beat Aljaz Bedene 7-5 6-4 to book a place in the Qatar Open quarter-finals as all his fellow seeds bowed out in the second round in Doha on Wednesday.  Slovenian Bedene saved 12 out of 15 break points to push the Austrian but the world number five survived the test to be the only seed left in the draw, apart from Frenchman Richard Gasquet, who won the event in 2013.  Yet world number 31 Gasquet, the fifth seed, was surprisingly beaten 6-3 6-4 in the late match by Greece\u2019s rising talent Stefanos Tsitsipas, with the 19-year-old from Athens progressing to face Thiem in the next round.  Seventh-seeded Fernando Verdasco was defeated 6-4 3-6 6-4 by Russian youngster Andrey Rublev while eighth seed Feliciano Lopez suffered a shock 6-4 7-6(2) loss to Bosnia\u2019s Mirza Basic, who is ranked 138th in the world.  The Spanish duo joined high-ranking players Pablo Carreno Busta, Tomas Berdych, Albert Ramos-Vinolas and Filip Krajinovic in exiting the tournament in the early stages.  In the quarter-finals, Rublev, 20, will face Croatia\u2019s Borna Coric, who ousted Carreno Busta in the first round, while Basic will take on Guido Pella after the Argentine overcame Stefano Travaglia 7-6(4) 6-3.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) is nearing a deal to acquire investment firm Fortress Investment Group LLC\u2019s stake in U.S. subprime lender OneMain Holdings Inc (OMF.N), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.  The deal would come after OneMain abandoned a process to sell itself outright last year, because the offers it received failed to meet its valuation expectations. It allows Fortress, which completed its $3.3 billion sale to SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) last week, to cash out on its investment in OneMain.  The transaction is expected to value Fortress\u2019 stake of around 44 percent in OneMain at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, and could be announced as early as Thursday, assuming talks do not fall apart at the last minute, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.  Apollo declined to comment, while OneMain and Fortress did not respond to requests for comment.  OneMain, which has provided loans and other credit products to more than 10 million customers in 44 states according to its website, was Citigroup Inc\u2019s (C.N) former consumer lending arm, CitiFinancial, until it was renamed in 2011. It specializes in loans to meet unexpected expenses such as medical bills or car repairs, and to buy small-ticket items.   OneMain, which has a market capitalization of $3.6 billion, was created in its current form in 2015, when Fortress acquired OneMain from Citigroup for $4.25 billion in cash and merged it with one of its existing portfolio companies, Springleaf Holdings Inc.   The deal with Apollo would mark the latest exit by Fortress from a portfolio company. Among Fortress\u2019 recent divestments are Florida East Coast Railway and bond fund manager Logan Circle Partners.  For Apollo, the deal represents a way to own a big chunk of OneMain without engaging in a full leveraged buyout, given that the company is already saddled with more than $14 billion in long-term debt.

          "title": "U.S. Attorney General appoints 17 interim top prosecutors",
          "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday appointed 17 current and former federal prosecutors as interim U.S. Attorneys in jurisdictions around the country, the Department of Justice said.  The interim posts are for 120 days unless those holding them are re-appointed by a court or officially nominated by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, a Justice Department official said.  It is unclear if those named on Wednesday will also be nominated. Some may face political opposition, as U.S. senators traditionally have some say in the nominations of U.S. Attorneys who would serve within their states.  Many of Sessions\u2019 appointments were in Democratic-leaning states such as New York, New Jersey and California. The Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.  Among those named was Geoffrey Berman, who served on Republican Trump\u2019s transition team. Berman will become the interim top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, a jurisdiction that is well known for terrorism cases, prosecutions of Wall Street financial crimes and government corruption.  Berman, who was an assistant U.S. Attorney in Manhattan from 1990 to 1994, is a partner at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, another supporter of Trump\u2019s presidential run in 2016, practices at the same firm.  Preet Bharara held the Manhattan U.S. Attorney post until March when he and 45 other U.S. Attorneys from the Obama administration were asked to resign. Bharara refused and was fired.  Manhattan and a number of other U.S. Attorney offices then had their second-in-commands elevated to serve as Acting U.S. Attorneys, a role that has a statutory limit.   The Department of Justice said in announcing the interim appointments that some of those time limits were expiring on Thursday.   Richard Donoghue, who served in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn from 2000 to 2011, will become the interim there on Thursday. In a statement, Sessions said Donoghue has experience prosecuting the MS-13 gang. Trump has often cited the violent Central American gang in arguing for restricting immigration.  A spokesman for Chuck Schumer, one of two Democratic U.S. Senators from New York, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman. But in a statement, the senator said Trump had consulted him about Donoghue, whom he praised as a \u201cno-nonsense prosecutor and an appropriate choice\u201d for the Brooklyn post.  Once Donoghue takes the post, Acting U.S. Attorney Bridget Rohde will resume her role as First Assistant United States Attorney.  Joon Kim, who took over in Manhattan after Bharara was fired, will leave the office tomorrow, a spokeswoman said, declining to comment on his future plans.

The Belgian forward converted to level the match at 1-1 in the 67th minute before Marcos Alonso put Chelsea ahead and Bellerin equalized.

Bellerin made amends for conceding the penalty by scoring a stoppage-time equalizer for Arsenal, although Chelsea had two further chances with Alvaro Morata firing at Petr Cech before Davide Zappacosta hit the crossbar.  \u201cMaybe I would have gone home and committed suicide,\u201d joked Wenger. \u201cI was so close to that.\u201d  Reporting by Rik Sharma, editing by Ed Osmond"

About 124,247 vehicles were sold in December, bringing the total number of units sold in 2017 to 2.03 million, according to a report published by the Global Automakers of Canada (GAC).  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that many years ago that sales levels over the 2 million mark would have seemed completely unrealistic, but there are a lot of positive fundamentals that have supported this growth, although the last two months of the year have seen sales growth moderate slightly,\u201d GAC President David Adams said.  General Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) December sales in Canada rose 9.2 percent but that of rivals Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) and Ford (F.N) fell due to weak demand.  Detroit-based GM sold 19,801 vehicles in Canada last month, with Chevrolet accounting for more than half of the total sales. (bit.ly/2Cx1LQr)  GM Canada sold 302,826 vehicles in 2017, up 13.3 percent over the previous year, contrasting with sales in the much bigger U.S. market where the Cadillac maker recorded a fall of 1.3 percent.  However, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N), reported a fall in monthly and yearly sales, hurt by a lower demand for its Jeep and Dodge branded vehicles in Canada.

          "title": "Winter storm challenges U.S. East Coast energy complex",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. energy industry was facing a massive test of its infrastructure as an intense winter storm roared up the Atlantic Coast, threatening power outages, refinery shutdowns and spikes in heating prices.  The storm swept the U.S. Southeast and headed toward New England on Wednesday, adding snow, freezing rain and strong winds to a record-shattering cold already affecting much of the eastern United States. Temperatures were expected to keep dropping throughout the weekend, according to private AccuWeather forecasts.  The cold weather punishing most of the country already caused Phillips 66  to shut a crude and coking unit at its Wood River, Illinois, refinery after a line froze followed by a brief fire, a source told Reuters on Wednesday.  Prices for heating oil and natural gas in the U.S. Northeast are at their highest levels in several years on the back of near-record heating demand.   The extreme cold has stoked fears that a significant disruption could lead to a heating oil shortage, as inventories of distillate products, including heating oil, in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions are at their lowest levels for this time of year since 2015. A number of tankers carrying diesel and heating oil from Europe are bound for the United States to address supply worries.  The U.S. Coast Guard in the key ports of Boston, New York Harbor and Philadelphia have deployed ice-breaking ships to help keep trade traffic moving, but delays were expected.  Gasoline and diesel futures have climbed above five-year highs for this time of year, boosting key refining margins to a five-year high for this time of year.  \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a big bang and price response but I don\u2019t expect the impact and price response to be as long lasting as what you saw during Hurricane Harvey,\u201d said John Auers, executive vice president at consultancy Turner, Mason & Co in Dallas.  Refiners along the U.S. East Coast were bracing for difficulties in the next few days. So far, the five refineries along the East Coast are dealing with frozen pipes and other challenges, but have not experienced any significant outages, according to sources at the plants.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of freeze-up but haven\u2019t lost any units. This weekend will be bad,\u201d said a source at Monroe Energy\u2019s 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery outside Philadelphia.  Monroe Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Although most refineries, particularly those in northern climates, are designed to operate throughout the winter, increasingly extreme weather conditions in recent years have tested their capabilities. In 2015, more than a third of the U.S. East Coast\u2019s capacity was abruptly shut down due to glitches.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions delayed a planned shutdown of a 50,000-bpd hydrotreater and a benzene unit at the Girard Point section of the Philadelphia refinery complex due to severe weather conditions, a source told Reuters on Wednesday.  Phillips 66 does not currently have a timeline for restarting the units at its Illinois plant, the source said.  U.S. natural gas demand was expected to remain near record highs this week due to the frigid weather. Natural gas is the major fuel for residential and commercial heating in the U.S. Northeast and is also widely used by power plants.  Total gas consumption in the lower 48 U.S. states peaked at 141.9 billion cubic feet per day on Monday, New Year\u2019s Day, and was expected to remain near that level all week, according to Thomson Reuters analysts.  One bcfd of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes.  Natural gas prices in New England last week jumped to $53.50 per million British thermal units, the highest since January 2014. The average price for gas in New England in 2017 was $3.80/mmBtu.  Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw, Jessica Resnick-Ault and Scott DiSavino; Editing by Alistair Bell"

About 124,247 vehicles were sold in December, bringing the total number of units sold in 2017 to 2.03 million, according to a report published by the Global Automakers of Canada (GAC).  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that many years ago that sales levels over the 2 million mark would have seemed completely unrealistic, but there are a lot of positive fundamentals that have supported this growth, although the last two months of the year have seen sales growth moderate slightly,\u201d GAC President David Adams said.  General Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) December sales in Canada rose 9.2 percent but that of rivals Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) and Ford (F.N) fell due to weak demand.  Detroit-based GM sold 19,801 vehicles in Canada last month, with Chevrolet accounting for more than half of the total sales. (bit.ly/2Cx1LQr)  GM Canada sold 302,826 vehicles in 2017, up 13.3 percent over the previous year, contrasting with sales in the much bigger U.S. market where the Cadillac maker recorded a fall of 1.3 percent.  However, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N), reported a fall in monthly and yearly sales, hurt by a lower demand for its Jeep and Dodge branded vehicles in Canada.  The company said it sold 17,654 vehicles in December, a drop of 6 percent compared to the year earlier. Full-year sales fell 4.2 percent to 267,052 vehicles.  Ford reported an 11.1 percent drop in monthly auto sales,  selling 17,565 vehicles in December. However, full-year sales were up by 1.3 percent.  \u201cWe are expecting a decline in auto sales for the year in 2018,\u201d Scotiabank analyst Carlos Gomes said, noting that a slower Canadian GDP growth and vehicle price increases outpacing income growth to be likely factors.

          "title": "Tesla pushes back Model 3 production target again, despite progress",
          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) delayed a production target for its new  Model 3 sedan for the second time on Wednesday, disappointing investors even as it claimed \u201cmajor progress\u201d overcoming manufacturing challenges that have hampered the vehicle\u2019s rollout.  The electric vehicle maker headed by Elon Musk said it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. Instead, Tesla said it now plans to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.  The delay sent shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company down 2 percent in after-market trading.  The Model 3 is critical to Tesla\u2019s long-term success, as it is the most affordable of its cars to date and is the only one capable of transforming the niche automaker to a mass producer amid a sea of rivals entering the nascent electric vehicle market.  Building the car efficiently and delivering it without delays to customers is also critical, as the money-losing company faces high cash burn. Delays increase the risk that reservation-holders will cancel orders.   \u201cThe further delay to (production volume) will leave analysts and investors focused on the implications for cash as we head through the first half of the year,\u201d Evercore analyst George Galliers told Reuters.  The company burned through $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in its third quarter and said in November that fourth-quarter capex would also be about $1.1 billion.   RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note that he did not believe Tesla will be required to do a capital raise.   \u201cWe have them hovering about $1 billion in cash ... They don\u2019t have a ton of wiggle room though in our view,\u201d Spak said.               In delivering 1,550 of its new Model 3 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, Tesla fell short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts had expected 4,100 Model 3 sedans to be delivered in the fourth quarter, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.  The estimates for Model 3 deliveries by different brokerages varied widely. While Evercore analysts estimated 5,800 deliveries, Cowen analysts expected just 2,250.  Tesla said 860 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the fourth quarter.  The company said it delivered a total of 29,870 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 15,200 Model S vehicles and 13,120 Model X cars. Analysts had expected total deliveries of about 30,000.  Tesla had initially predicted to reach the milestone of 5,000 vehicles per week in December, but in November deferred the target to the end of the first quarter.  Tesla said on Wednesday its production rate had increased significantly despite the delays.   \u201cIn the last seven working days of the quarter, we made 793 Model 3s, and in the last few days, we hit a production rate on each of our manufacturing lines that extrapolates to over 1,000 Model 3s per week,\u201d the company said in a statement.  That pace of production is still below that of many carmakers. A conventional car factory operating at full speed on two shifts can churn out nearly 1,000 vehicles a day.  The Model 3 - which starts at $35,000, or about half the price of its flagship Model S - was met with great enthusiasm when its prototype was first unveiled in early 2016. Tesla said in August it had about 500,000 reservations for the car and demand was not a constraint.  Production, however, hit snags during a period of \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d Musk first warned of in July. Among the issues Tesla faced was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, which required a redesign.  In its third quarter, Tesla built just 260 Model 3s.  Although bullish investors have generally waved off early Model 3 problems, instead focusing on the future prospects of Tesla, critics warn that Model 3 issues could sour demand for Tesla\u2019s mass-market vehicle, delay sorely needed revenue and compromise the company\u2019s ability to raise cash in the future.  Tesla shares, despite paring some gains from a high of $385 in September, still trade at 46 percent above their price a year ago.

The deal follows similar agreements with firms including Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), Denso (6902.T) and Aptiv Plc (APTV.N) to develop autonomous-driving technology with BlackBerry\u2019s QNX software, which are expected to start generating revenue in 2019.   Investors and analysts are closely watching what comes of those agreements amid expectations that QNX could become a key technology in the burgeoning self-driving vehicle industry, serving as the operating system for computer chips used to run self-driving vehicles.  QNX will be the operating system for Apollo, a platform for self-driving vehicles that Baidu announced in April and has billed as the \u201cAndroid\u201d of the autonomous driving industry.   \u201cThe opportunity is global, it\u2019s for a very large market and I think it\u2019s a very solid win for BlackBerry,\u201d said CIBC Capital Markets analyst Todd Coupland.  Apollo has since signed up several major automakers, including Ford Motor Co (F.N), Hyundai Motor Group (005380.KS) and several Chinese carmakers.

          "body": "SYDNEY, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Australian new vehicle sales hit a record for both December and all of 2017 as demand for sports utilities showed no sign of cooling, while strong sales of commercial vehicles pointed to solid business spending.  The Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries\u2019 VFACTS report on Thursday showed 102,820 new vehicles were sold in December, up a healthy 4.1 percent on the same month of 2016. December this year had one more selling day.  That total was a record for a December month and hinted at a welcome pick-up in consumer spending.  Sales for the whole year ran 0.9 percent ahead of 2016, to reach another all-time high at 1.19 million.  It was also the first year in which sales of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) outpaced those of passenger cars.  \u201cAustralians bought 465,646 SUVs during 2017 for a 39.2 percent share of the total market,\u201d said FCAI chief executive Tony Weber. That was up from 37.8 percent in 2016.  For December alone, sales of SUVs were up 15.7 percent on a year before, while passenger vehicles dropped 13.3 percent.  Demand for commercial vehicles continued its strong run with the light sector up a hefty 20.6 percent on December 2016, while sales of heavy vehicles rose 13.7 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp retained first place on the sales ladder in December with a reduced share of 16.6 percent. The Holden unit of General Motors had one of its best months of the year to take second spot with 11.8 percent.  Mazda Motor Corp followed with 8.9 percent, just ahead of Mitsubishi at 8.8 percent. Hyundai Motor claimed 6.0 percent and Ford 5.5 percent.  Toyota topped the table for all of 2017, followed by Mazda and Hyundai. (Reporting by Wayne Cole; editing by Richard Pullin)"

Tyler Barriss, 25, has waived his right to an extradition hearing, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County district attorney\u2019s office, Paul Eakins, said.

          "body": "SYDNEY, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Australian air crash investigators and police on Thursday began hoisting a seaplane from the Sydney river where it sank after crashing on New Year\u2019s Eve, killing six people, including the chief executive of British catering company Compass Group Plc.  Compass chief executive Richard Cousins, 58, and four members of his family were among the six people who died when the plane hit the water shortly after takeoff, according to police.  Police divers and a barge fitted with a small crane arrived not long after dawn on Thursday to begin lifting the plane out of about 13 metres of water near Cowan, 40 km (25 miles) north of Sydney. The job was expected to take several hours.  Using the crane, underwater airbags, or a combination of the two, they hope to recover the aircraft intact and take it by barge to a park downstream for further examination.  Investigators also hope to retrieve personal phones or other electronic devices that may have been on board when the plane crashed on Sunday, which could help to piece together what happened.  The plane\u2019s pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, was also killed in the crash.  Air crash investigation records, first reported by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Thursday and reviewed by Reuters, show an airplane with the same serial number crashed 21 years earlier, when it was being used as a crop duster.  The 1996 Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) accident report found that the aircraft, a DHC-2 de Havilland Canada, likely stalled and that conditions were gusty when it crashed, killing the pilot.  \u201cIt was repaired after the accident and all appropriate approvals and checks were done.  It was then re-registered and went back into service,\u201d a spokesman for Australia\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority said in an email.  The ATSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Sydney Seaplanes, which operated the Sunday flight, said the company had no comment while the investigation into the crash continues.  The business has operated since 2005 with no previous record of mishap. Its director, Aaron Shaw, told reporters on Monday that the engines of its planes are regularly replaced, and the motor on the crashed aircraft had flown for only 200 hours.  Australian police have identified the family members killed along with Cousins as Emma Bowden, 48; Heather Bowden, 11; Edward Cousins, 23; and William Cousins, 25.  Family members and media reports identified the four as Cousins\u2019 two sons, his fianc\u00e9e and her daughter. (Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

The Houston-based company raised its dividend to 6 cents, payable on Feb. 7 to shareholders of record as of Jan. 24. It was the second dividend increase in as many years for Cabot.  Cabot has helped push the U.S. shale industry in recent years to focus more on returns and less on boosting production, regardless of costs.  Dan Dinges, Cabot\u2019s chief executive, said the increase was due to the company\u2019s \u201cstrong balance sheet and our ability to deliver double-digit growth\u201d from its core Marcellus Shale operations.  Cabot last month said it would sell its Eagle Ford Shale assets in Texas for $765 million, part of a push to curb costs.

          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico City residents should be free to grow marijuana for personal use, a mayoral hopeful told Reuters on Wednesday, arguing that one of the world\u2019s largest cities should lead the charge to end prohibition in a country riven by drug violence.  The proposal would bring Mexico City in line with a global trend toward legalizing cannabis use, Salomon Chertorivski said in an interview, a few days after California launched legal sales of the drug for recreational use.  \u201cMy proposal is the legalization of private cultivation for personal consumption, not for sale, in homes in Mexico City,\u201d said the center-left Chertorivski, a former federal health minister and Mexico City government official who is one of three candidates seeking the ticket for a left-right coalition ahead of a mayoral election.  Opinion polls show the alliance in second place behind the left-wing Morena party, which has already chosen its likely candidate for the July 1 election.  Drug use should be a public health rather than a criminal matter, the 43-year-old Chertorivski said, adding that Mexico City should take a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach rather than follow the example of Portugal, which has decriminalized the use of hard drugs.   Mexico City, a megalopolis whose urban sprawl comprises more than 20 million people, has been at the vanguard of a shift in Mexico to more socially liberal laws in recent years. It led the way for several Mexican states to allow same-sex marriage, and was first to offer women abortions in most cases.  \u201cI am sure that this discussion will have the same luck,\u201d Chertorivski said.   Mexico has softened its drug laws in recent years, decriminalizing possession of small amounts of several drugs, although it retains harsh penalties for larger quantities.   Recreational marijuana is still broadly prohibited, but in 2015 the Supreme Court granted four plaintiffs the right to grow their own marijuana for personal consumption on human rights grounds. The country legalized the use of marijuana for medical and scientific needs in June.  Those milestones have helped stir debate in Mexico, where violent drug cartels have contributed to a death toll of at least 140,000 people over the past decade.  Chertorivski said legalizing cultivation would take business away from illegal gangs and keep marijuana users from drifting into criminal activity. He also proposed more than doubling the minimum wage to reduce crime.  Despite the trend toward legalization north of the border, cartels still make millions of dollars from smuggling marijuana into the United States.

          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The Trump administration should encourage U.S. technology companies to provide communication services to Iranians as they protest their country\u2019s clerical rulers, said Reza Pahlavi, the last heir to the Iranian monarchy,  In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Pahlavi also criticized the Trump administration\u2019s ban on travel to the United States by most Iranians, calling it \u201cridiculous\u201d.  Anti-government protests have gripped Iran for nearly a week in the most sustained challenge to the Islamic Republic\u2019s clerical elite in almost a decade.  Pahlavi has lived in exile for nearly four decades, since his father, the U.S.-backed shah, was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  Although the opposition to Iran\u2019s clerical government is atomized, with no clear recognized leader, some of the demonstrators have chanted slogans in favor of Pahlavi\u2019s grandfather, Reza Shah, breaking a longstanding taboo.  Pahlavi said he wants to see Iranians \u201cdetermine their own fate out of their own free will,\u201d and praised U.S. President Donald Trump and members of his cabinet for speaking in support of Iranian protesters.  But he said they also should take steps to ensure that Iranians have access to communication and social media tools, which they have used to share videos and messages documenting protests and clashes with security forces.  Iran, which bars the use of major social media platforms, also has restricted access to the Telegram messaging app, and Iranian users in recent days have reported major hurdles in accessing the internet.  \u201cWe need more than lip service. We need to see concrete actions,\u201d Pahlavi said. \u201cThis has to be immediate ... As we speak, the regime is attempting yet again to try to shut down whatever it is, whether it\u2019s Instagram or Telegram.\u201d  There is a precedent for this type of U.S. intervention. In 2009, amid mass protests over a disputed election, an Obama administration official asked Twitter executives to delay scheduled maintenance so Iranians could continue to use the service to communicate.  Technology experts have documented numerous examples of commercial services being denied to Iranians, often because of concerns about running afoul of U.S. sanctions.  Activists have urged tech companies to loosen their Iran policies, but say the Trump administration could expand exemptions to make clear that some services are allowed.  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a news briefing on Tuesday that the United States wants to see Iranians have access to social media and other tools. But when asked if Google was \u201cover-interpreting\u201d U.S. sanctions on Iran by blocking access to one of its services there, Nauert said she had \u201cno idea.\u201d  The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what discussions if any it has had with tech companies.  The Obama administration approved exemptions to U.S. sanctions that allowed for providing chat, email, social networking, photo sharing, web browsing, blogging and other personal communication services.  Twitter and messaging service Signal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook and Google declined to comment.  \u201cThe policies of these companies are not really clear,\u201d said Amir Rashidi, an internet security researcher at the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a non-governmental organization based in New York. Pahlavi critiqued the Trump administration\u2019s decision to ban nearly all Iranian travelers and immigrants from the United States as part of a broader travel ban targeting several mostly Muslim countries.  \u201cIranian diplomats still can travel (here) but innocent Iranians who in fact work and have built this country are barred from coming,\u201d said Pahlavi, who lives in the United States. \u201cWhy? Because they\u2019re under the so-called ban. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d  A State Department spokeswoman said U.S. support for the Iranian people \u201cis a fundamentally separate issue\u201d from the travel ban.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Pahlavi\u2019s remarks. (Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by John Walcott and James Dalgleish)"

          "title": "Hungary, Poland demand bigger say in EU, reject its migration policy",
          "body": "BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s migration policy has failed, Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Wednesday, as he and his Polish counterpart demanded a bigger say in the bloc\u2019s future.  Orban and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki lead conservative governments under fire from Brussels over their refusal to take in migrants under a quota system and over their efforts to tighten state control of their courts and media.  \u201cIn terms of migration and quotas that were to be imposed on (EU) member countries we strongly reject such an approach as it infringes on sovereign decisions of member states,\u201d Morawiecki told a joint news conference after talks with Orban in Budapest.  Echoing that line, Orban said: \u201cThe EU\u2019s migration policy... has failed.\u201d  \u201cWe want to have a strong say, as these countries (in Central Europe) have a vision about the future of Europe,\u201d added the Hungarian leader, who is expected to win a further four years in power in an election due in April.  Orban led criticism in ex-communist central and eastern Europe of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision in 2015 to open Germany\u2019s doors to more than one million, mostly Muslim migrants and refugees fleeing conflicts in Syria, Iraq and beyond.  Morawiecki, a former finance minister who only became prime minister last month, said Central European countries would also present a common front in looming negotiations on the EU\u2019s next seven-year budget that starts in 2021.  The ex-communist central European nations are all net recipients of EU funds, with Poland - the region\u2019s biggest economy - benefiting most. Wealthier western EU states such as Germany want to keep a firm lid on spending, especially with the planned departure of net donor Britain from the bloc in 2019.  Morawiecki and Orban appeared to have struck up a good personal relationship, reinforcing their countries\u2019 diplomatic rapprochement within the EU.  When the EU\u2019s executive Commission launched an unprecedented legal action against Warsaw in December in an attempt to force it to reverse judicial reforms that Brussels says undermine democracy, Orban signaled he would use Hungary\u2019s right of veto to prevent any punitive sanctions against Poland.  Orban cited Austria\u2019s recent election - which resulted in a far-right party joining the conservatives in a new coalition -  - as proof that concerns about immigration were not limited to the ex-communist east.  \u201c(Democracy was) reinstalled as Austrians who do not want immigration elected a government which also opposes immigration. This will be the same everywhere in Europe, I believe this is only a matter of time,\u201d said Orban.  Both Orban\u2019s Fidesz and the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) in Poland are riding high in national opinion polls, thanks to their strong economic record, their tough anti-migrant policies and their defiance of EU institutions.  Critics say reforms introduced by Fidesz in Hungary and by PiS in Poland undermine democracy and the rule of law, charges rejected by Budapest and Warsaw.  Editing by Gareth Jones"

          "title": "Americans should worry about Kim's mental fitness, not Trump's:  White House",
          "body": "WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday defended Donald Trump\u2019s tweet about the size of his nuclear button, saying Americans should be concerned about the North Korean leader\u2019s mental fitness, not their president\u2019s.  On Tuesday, Trump responded to a New Year\u2019s Day speech in which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned he had a nuclear button on his desk by saying that his nuclear button \u201cis a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d  The tweet provoked strong criticism, especially from Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents, and former Vice President Joe Biden called it dangerously cavalier.  Asked whether Americans should be concerned about the president\u2019s mental fitness after he appeared to be speaking so lightly about nuclear threats, White House spokeswoman Sara Sanders told a regular news briefing:  \u201cThe president and the people of this country should be concerned about the mental fitness of the leader of North Korea.  \u201cHe\u2019s made repeated threats, he\u2019s tested missiles time and time again for years, and this is a president who\u2019s not going to cower down and who\u2019s not going to be weak and is going to make sure that he does what he\u2019s promised to do and that is stand up and protect the American people.\u201d  Trump and Kim have exchanged repeated insults in recent months in a crisis over North Korea\u2019s program to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States, raising alarm worldwide.  Trump has at times appeared to dismiss the prospect of a diplomatic solution and both sides have threatened to destroy each other.  Former Vice President Joe Biden said Trump had shown \u201creally poor judgment.\u201d  \u201cThe only war that is worse than one that\u2019s intended, is one that is not intended,\u201d Biden was quoted as saying by CNN. \u201cThis is not a game. This is not about, you know, can I puff my chest out.\u201d  \u201cThe United States has a role in the world that the world has come to expect. I think the president is much, much too cavalier. And it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d  Senator Edward Markey, the top Democrat on the Senate\u2019s East Asia Subcommittee, said Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cbordered on presidential malpractice, needlessly deepening\u00a0a crisis and squandering a fresh opportunity to attempt diplomacy.\u201d  In his New Year speech, Kim warned that the entire United States was in range of North Korea nuclear missiles and added: \u201cA nuclear button is always on my desk. This is reality, not a threat.\u201d  Kim said his country would focus in the coming year on mass producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment, but added that these would be used only if North Korea\u2019s security was threatened.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the Voice of America Trump was making clear that \u201cAmerica will not be bullied, America will not be threatened.\u201d  He said that while all options remained on the table, there was the opportunity for a peaceable solution to the crisis if \u201cNorth Korea will abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions, if they will dismantle those programs.\u201d  In his address, Kim also said he was open to speaking with U.S. ally South Korea and would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics to be held in South Korea in February.  U.S. officials have responded coolly to this overture and the  State Department said North Korea \u201cmight be trying to drive a wedge\u201d between Washington and Seoul.  On Tuesday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not contribute to denuclearizing North Korea.  Haley also said Washington was hearing reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile and warned of even tougher steps in response if it did so.  On Tuesday, Seoul responded to Kim by proposing high-level discussions at the heavily armed Korean border next week, and on Wednesday North Korea reopened a border hotline that had been closed since February 2016.  South Korean officials at the border received a call from the North at 0630 GMT and officials on both sides conducted a conversation for about 20 minutes, South Korea\u2019s unification ministry said. It did not disclose the content of the discussion.  There was no immediate U.S. comment on the reopening of the hotline, although a State Department spokeswoman, Katina Adams, said Washington remained in close contact with Seoul \u201cabout a unified response to North Korea.\u201d  She said that as South Korea President Moon Jae-in had stated, \u201c\u2018the improvement of relations between North and South Korea cannot advance separately from resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.\u2019\u201d  The reopening of the hotline came hours after the tweet from Trump, who has repeatedly mocked Kim as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d.  Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day speech followed a steep increase in missile launches by North Korea in 2017, as well as its sixth and most powerful nuclear test.  North Korea\u2019s KCNA news agency quoted Ri Son Gwon, chairman of North Korea\u2019s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, as saying talks with South Korea would aim to establish formal dialogue about sending a North Korean delegation to the Olympics.  \u201cWe will try to keep close communications with the south Korean side from sincere stand (sic) and honest attitude, true to the intention of our supreme leadership, and deal with the practical matters related to the dispatch of our delegation,\u201d he said.    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said both sides should seize the Olympics as an opportunity to improve ties and make concrete efforts toward alleviating tension.

          "title": "U.S. blocks MoneyGram sale to China's Ant Financial on national security concerns",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Ant Financial\u2019s plan to acquire U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) collapsed on Tuesday after a U.S. government panel rejected it over national security concerns, the most high-profile Chinese deal to be torpedoed under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.  The $1.2 billion deal\u2019s failure represents a blow for Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Chinese internet conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), who owns Ant Financial together with Alibaba executives. He was looking to expand Ant Financial\u2019s footprint amid fierce domestic competition from Chinese rival Tencent Holdings Ltd\u2019s (0700.HK) WeChat payment platform.   Ma, a Chinese citizen who appears frequently with leaders from the highest echelons of the Communist Party, had promised Trump in a meeting a year ago that he would create 1 million U.S. jobs.  MoneyGram shares fell 8.5 percent in after-market trading.  The companies decided to terminate their deal after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) rejected their proposals to mitigate concerns over the safety of data that can be used to identify U.S. citizens, according to sources familiar with the confidential discussions.  \u201cDespite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger,\u201d MoneyGram Chief Executive Alex Holmes said in a statement on Tuesday.  The U.S. government has toughened its stance on the sale of companies to Chinese entities, at a time when Trump is trying to put pressure on China to help tackle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues.  The MoneyGram deal is the latest in a string of Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies that have failed to clear CFIUS, including the $1.3 billion purchase by China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O).  In November, China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd (0715.HK) and Genworth Financial Inc (GNW.N) extended a deadline to April 1 for the Chinese group\u2019s planned $2.7 billion takeover of the U.S. life insurer.  Asked on Wednesday for Beijing\u2019s view on the deal\u2019s rejection, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said cooperation on economic and trade matters was of mutual benefit.  \u201cWe hope the U.S. can create a fair and predictable environment for Chinese enterprises to invest and start up businesses,\u201d the spokesman said.   However, commentary published after the deal\u2019s collapse by official news agency Xinhua went further, describing a fading bonhomie between the two countries, with the United States \u201cstuck in a zero-sum mentality\u201d.  \u201cChina and the United States are about to ride a bumpy journey in trade in 2018 if the U.S. government goes its own way, and retaliatory measures by China could be on the table,\u201d it said.  The MoneyGram deal\u2019s demise is also the latest example of how CFIUS\u2019 focus on cyber security and the integrity of personal data is prompting it to block deals in sectors not traditionally associated with national security, such as financial services.  The U.S. Treasury said it is prohibited by statute from disclosing information filed with CFIUS and declined to comment on the MoneyGram deal.   Other U.S. financial services deals by Chinese firms are waiting for approval from CFIUS, including HNA Group Co\u2019s acquisition of hedge fund-of-funds firm SkyBridge Capital LLC from Anthony Scaramucci, the Trump administration\u2019s former communications director.  SkyBridge and HNA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Dallas-based MoneyGram has approximately 350,000 remittance locations in more than 200 countries. Ant Financial was looking to take over MoneyGram not so much for its U.S. presence but to expand in growing markets outside of China.  Ant Financial and MoneyGram said they will now explore and develop initiatives to work together in remittance and digital payments in China, India, the Philippines and other Asian markets, as well as in the United States. This cooperation will take the form of commercial agreements, one of the sources said.  Any arrangements reached by Ant Financial and MoneyGram that do not involve a transaction would not be subject to review by CFIUS.  \u201cWhat is more likely to happen at this point is that MoneyGram will sell to another company, and one company that has shown interest in the past is Euronet,\u201d said Gil Luria, an equity analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.  Ant Financial agreed an $18 per share all-cash deal to acquire MoneyGram in April, seeing off competition from U.S.-based Euronet Worldwide Inc (EEFT.O), which had made an unsolicited offer for MoneyGram and openly lobbied U.S lawmakers, saying Ant\u2019s proposal created a national security risk.  \u201cEuronet continues to believe there is compelling commercial logic to a combination between Euronet and MoneyGram. However, significant developments have been disclosed by MoneyGram since Euronet\u2019s offer, and Euronet has not conducted any evaluation of the business in that time. While we continue to view a transaction with MoneyGram as logical, there is no guarantee any offer will be made or any transaction will ultimately occur,\u201d Euronet said in a statement.  Ant Financial said it paid MoneyGram a $30 million termination fee for the deal\u2019s collapse.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index rose above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and other major indexes hit record closing highs as technology stocks climbed after signs of robust economic growth.  Stocks added slightly to gains late, with some support from minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s last policy meeting showing the U.S. central bank would likely stick to gradual interest rate hikes this year.  \u201cThey reiterated gradual rate increases, so that\u2019s steady as she goes, which the stock market seems to like,\u201d said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.   Earlier in the session, data showed U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, a sign of economic momentum at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy.  For technology stocks, Alphabet Inc, IBM and chipmakers were among the biggest drivers. The S&P 500 tech index, the best-performing S&P sector in 2017 with a 37 percent jump, ended the day up 1.1 percent.  U.S. chipmaker stocks surged for a second straight session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 1.7 percent in its strongest two-day performance since June 2016.  \u201cThe (recent) selloff in tech stocks may have made that group look attractive today given that there\u2019s still significant growth potential there both short term and long term,\u201d Hellwig said.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,922.68, the S&P 500 gained 17.25 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,713.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.63 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,065.53.  The Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX and a popular options-based gauge of expected near-term price volatility, closed at 9.15, just shy of its record low close of 9.14 on Nov. 3.  Gains in energy and healthcare also boosted the market. The S&P energy index gained 1.5 percent while S&P healthcare rose 1 percent.  Intel Corp ended down 3.4 percent. The company acknowledged a report that a design flaw in its chips could let hackers steal data but said it was working on a solution that would not significantly slow computers.  Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices climbed 5.2 percent. Nvidia Corp gained 6.6 percent and Micron Technology Inc rose 3 percent.  Oracle Crop shares were up 2.3 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the business software maker.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  About 7.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

          "title": "Surgery death rates in Africa are twice global average - study",
          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Death rates for patients undergoing surgery in Africa are double the global average even though they tend to be younger, scientists said on Wednesday, adding that many deaths were likely preventable.  Contributory factors include few specialists, poor hospital infrastructure and a lack of post-operative monitoring, they said in a study published in the Lancet medical journal.  \u201cPatients receiving surgery in Africa are younger than the global average, with a lower-risk profile and lower complication rates, and yet are twice as likely to die,\u201d the authors wrote.  The survey - the most comprehensive study of surgery in Africa - was funded by the Medical Research Council of South Africa and covered 247 hospitals in 25 countries.   It showed about one in five surgery patients developed a complication. Comparisons with international data for elective surgery showed that death rates from elective surgery were 1 percent in Africa compared with 0.5 percent for the global average.   Infections accounted for more than half of complications. The most common procedure was caesarian delivery.  The authors suggested many lives could be saved by improving patient monitoring during and after surgery.   They said a lack of crucial equipment and supplies hampered surgical care in Africa; a quarter of hospitals have no reliable oxygen source, a third do not have reliable electricity and nearly half do not have dedicated postoperative care.     Data showed there were just 0.7 specialists per 100,000 people in the study countries - around 30 times lower than the levels needed to reduce mortality.          Although the main aim of the study was to examine surgical outcomes, the authors said the most alarming finding was how few people actually received surgery.   An average of 212 operations per 100,000 people were performed in the study countries - 20 times lower than the level required to meet a country\u2019s surgical needs.  Although there was an urgent need to improve peri-operative care in Africa, the authors said the absence of surgery represented \u201ca silent killer that probably claims more lives\u201d.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc and Mylan NV plan to begin a pivotal clinical trial of a biosimilar to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc\u2019s blockbuster eye drug Eylea in the first half of this year, the two companies said on Wednesday.  If successful, it would likely mark the first competition from a cheaper biosimilar of Eylea, although Regeneron says it has U.S. patent protection on the treatment until 2023.  Germany\u2019s Formycon AG is far along in testing a biosimilar to Eylea rival Lucentis from Roche. It lists an Eylea biosimilar at the preclinical stage on its pipeline chart, putting it behind the Momenta/Mylan candidate.   Eylea, which treats a leading cause of blindness in the elderly - wet age-related macular degeneration - and related eye conditions, accounts for most of Regeneron\u2019s revenue.  Regeneron shares fell 1.5 percent to $388 in extended trading. Momenta shares rose 6 percent to $15, while Mylan shares were unchanged from their Nasdaq close at $43.14.   U.S. Eylea sales rose 12 percent in the third quarter to $953 million. Sales outside the United States, which are booked by Bayer AG, rose 20 percent in the most recently reported quarter. Global sales in 2016 exceeded $5 billion.  Eylea is also approved to treat macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema.  The proposed trial of the biosimilar, currently called M710, will be in patients with diabetic macular edema and compare the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity with Eylea.  Unlike generic versions of traditional pills, it is not possible to produce exact copies of complex biotech medicines made from living cells, thus the term biosimilar.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index rose above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and other major indexes hit record closing highs as technology stocks climbed after signs of robust economic growth.  Stocks added slightly to gains late, with some support from minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s last policy meeting showing the U.S. central bank would likely stick to gradual interest rate hikes this year.  \u201cThey reiterated gradual rate increases, so that\u2019s steady as she goes, which the stock market seems to like,\u201d said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.   Earlier in the session, data showed U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, a sign of economic momentum at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy.  For technology stocks, Alphabet Inc, IBM and chipmakers were among the biggest drivers. The S&P 500 tech index, the best-performing S&P sector in 2017 with a 37 percent jump, ended the day up 1.1 percent.  U.S. chipmaker stocks surged for a second straight session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 1.7 percent in its strongest two-day performance since June 2016.  \u201cThe (recent) selloff in tech stocks may have made that group look attractive today given that there\u2019s still significant growth potential there both short term and long term,\u201d Hellwig said.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,922.68, the S&P 500 gained 17.25 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,713.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.63 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,065.53.  The Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX and a popular options-based gauge of expected near-term price volatility, closed at 9.15, just shy of its record low close of 9.14 on Nov. 3.  Gains in energy and healthcare also boosted the market. The S&P energy index gained 1.5 percent while S&P healthcare rose 1 percent.  Intel Corp ended down 3.4 percent. The company acknowledged a report that a design flaw in its chips could let hackers steal data but said it was working on a solution that would not significantly slow computers.  Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices climbed 5.2 percent. Nvidia Corp gained 6.6 percent and Micron Technology Inc rose 3 percent.  Oracle Crop shares were up 2.3 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the business software maker.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  About 7.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

          "title": "Factbox: Excerpts from 'Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House'",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A portrait of the Trump presidency in a forthcoming book, \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff, roiled the White House on Wednesday and caused a public split between President Donald Trump and his former chief strategist and far-right campaign architect Steve Bannon.  Here are excerpts from the book, due to be released on Tuesday.  \u201cAs the campaign came to an end, Trump himself was sanguine. His ultimate goal, after all, had never been to win. ... \u2018This is bigger than I ever dreamed of,\u2019 he told (former Fox News chief Roger) Ailes a week before the election. \u2018I don\u2019t think about losing, because it isn\u2019t losing. We\u2019ve totally won.\u2019\u201d  \u201cOnce he lost, Trump would be both insanely famous and a martyr to Crooked Hillary. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared would be international celebrities. Steve Bannon would become the de facto head of the tea-party movement. Kellyanne Conway would be a cable-news star. Melania Trump, who had been assured by her husband that he wouldn\u2019t become president, could return to inconspicuously lunching. Losing would work out for everybody. Losing was winning.\u201d  After Melania Trump was inconsolable that the New York Post obtained outtakes from a nude photo shoot done early in her modeling carer, Trump told her they would sue. \u201cBut he was unaccustomedly contrite, too. Just a little longer, he told her. It would all be over in November. He offered his wife a solemn guarantee: there was simply no way he would win.\u201d   \u201cShortly after 8 p.m. on Election Night, when the unexpected trend - Trump might actually win - seemed confirmed, Don Jr. told a friend that his father, or DJT, as he calls him, looked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania was in tears - and not of joy.\u201d  \u201c(Kellyanne) Conway, the campaign\u2019s manager, was in a remarkably buoyant mood, considering she was about to experience a resounding, if not cataclysmic, defeat. ... Now she briefed some of the television producers and anchors whom she had been carefully courting since joining the Trump campaign \u2014 and with whom she had been actively interviewing in the last few weeks, hoping to land a permanent on-air job after the election.  \u201cBalancing risk against reward, both Jared (Kushner) and Ivanka decided to accept roles in the West Wing over the advice of almost everyone they knew. It was a joint decision by the couple, and, in some sense, a joint job. Between themselves, the two had made an earnest deal: If sometime in the future the opportunity arose, she\u2019d be the one to run for president. The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump.\u201d  \u201cThe chance that Don Jr did not walk these jumos up to this father\u2019s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero.\u201d  \u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers.\u201d  \u201cEven if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.\u201d      Reporting by Mark Hosenball, Doina Chiacu; Editing by Cynthia Osterman"

          "body": "HAVANA (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, arrived in Cuba on Wednesday to help strengthen member countries\u2019 economic and political ties with the Communist-run island.  Mogherini\u2019s visit \u201creconfirms the strong EU-Cuban relationship,\u201d and she will press for an \u201cambitious and swift joint implementation of the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement,\u201d the EU said in a statement.  As the U.S.-Cuba rapprochement unfolded in 2015-2016 the EU dropped all sanctions and negotiated the agreement, the first accord between Cuba and the 28-nation bloc.  Signed in December 2016 and ratified in November, the EU said at the time that it hoped to position its companies for Cuba\u2019s transition to a more open economy and allow the EU to press for political freedoms on the island.  \u201cI was here visiting just a few days before the visit of President Obama, and I remember at the time there was much talk about Cuba strengthening relations with both the European Union and the United States,\u201d Mogherini said, when asked by reporters about the Trump administration\u2019s partial rollback of a fragile detente between the old Cold War foes.  \u201cRegardless of the changes in policy in Washington, the message I am bringing here is that the friendship and relationship with the EU is here to stay. It\u2019s solid, it\u2019s stable and it\u2019s reliable,\u201d she said.  Mogherini\u2019s first official meeting on the two-day visit was with Foreign Investment and Cooperation Minister Rodrigo Malmierca.  She was also scheduled to meet with the head of the Roman Catholic Church, Archbishop Giorgio Lingua, and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Thursday.  \u201cCuba\u2019s weak economy has been battered by the collapse in Venezuela, making it more vulnerable and open to foreign capital. Europe is seizing the moment,\u201d said economist\u00a0Andrew Zimbalist, a\u00a0Cuba\u00a0expert at Smith College in the United States.  Cuba faces a host of challenges, including declining aid from socialist ally Venezuela. Last month Cuba extended the term of its current leadership to April, signaling a two-month delay in the historic handover from Raul Castro to a new president, while announcing tighter regulations on the non-state sector.  The official Juventud Rebelde newspaper reported on Wednesday that the EU is the most important exporter and second trading partner of Cuba, and also the most important donor of cooperation and foreign investment.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A company that plans to build a coal export terminal in the Pacific Northwest to ship western U.S. coal to Asian markets sued the state of Washington on Wednesday for blocking construction last year.  Lighthouse Resources Inc filed a lawsuit in federal court against Washington Governor Jay Inslee and two state regulators for allegedly violating the U.S. Constitution\u2019s commerce clause by denying permits to allow the company to ship coal mined in Wyoming, Montana and other western states through its proposed Millennium Bulk Terminal to clients in Japan and South Korea.  Lighthouse Resources\u2019 complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Tacoma, claims that state regulators \u201cunreasonably\u201d refused to process permits to develop a site on the Columbia River where an existing Washington state lease allows coal exports.  The governor\u2019s office confirmed it received the filing and is reviewing it but cannot address pending litigation, said spokeswoman Tara Lee.  Washington state\u2019s Department of Ecology denied a key water quality permit for the Millennium Coal Terminal, blocking what would be the largest coal export terminal in the United States. The agency said the export terminal would cause environmental harm in nine areas, from air quality to vessel traffic.  Lighthouse, a privately held company based in Salt Lake City, says that by rejecting necessary permits, regulators imposed an \u201cembargo\u201d on new coal exports and discriminated against Lighthouse\u2019s efforts to transport coal mined in Montana and Wyoming through Washington.  The commerce clause gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce to prevent economic battles between states.  Lighthouse, which is the parent company of the Millennium Bulk Terminals and whose subsidiary companies own coal mines in Wyoming and Montana, accused Washington state officials of being \u201cphilosophically opposed to coal.\u201d  \u201cBut that does not give them legal authority to discriminate against this project and block foreign trade and interstate commerce,\u201d Lighthouse Resources Chief Executive Officer Everett King said.

The company also said that since the coal its subsidiaries are mining are on federally leased land, preventing exports to customers in Japan and South Korea keeps the companies from achieving \u201cmaximum economic recovery for minerals.\u201d  The Millennium Coal Terminal is the last of six proposed coal terminals in the Pacific Northwest that was denied approval by state regulators or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers amid opposition from states and the Lummi Tribe, which argued that coal terminals interfered with their fishing rights.

          "body": "LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 2 percent on Wednesday to the highest in 2-1/2 years, with buying spurred by a sixth day of unrest in OPEC member Iran and strong economic data from the United States and Germany.   U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled at $61.63 a barrel, up $1.26, or 2.1 percent.  International benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.27 a barrel, or 1.9 percent, to $67.84 a barrel.  During the session, WTI hit the highest since June 2015 while Brent touched its peak since May 2015.   After settlement, energy industry group the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. oil inventories fell by 5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 29. The U.S. Energy Department was scheduled to report official figures on oil inventories on Thursday.   The API said distillate stocks rose by 4.3 million barrels, more than expected. After the data, U.S. heating oil futures pared gains sharply. Heating oil had settled higher on the back of the cold weather hitting a large swathe of the United States.  Heating oil futures HOc1 settled at $2.0880 a gallon, up 1.4 percent. Cold weather on the East Coast has drawn a number of tankers carrying diesel and heating oil from Europe, reversing a traditional trade route.  Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards have deployed forces to three provinces to put down anti-government unrest, their commander said on Wednesday. Six days of protests have left 21 people dead.   \u201cWhile the Iran tensions are certainly a factor, the slew of remarkably strong economic data today is also forcing the rally,\u201d said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.  Germany\u2019s unemployment rate hit a record low in December, underpinning a broad-based economic upswing. U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, a further sign of strong economic momentum.   Manufacturing and construction reports also fuelled expectations for a robust U.S. economy in 2018.    Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark\u2019s Saxo Bank, warned that \u201cmultiple but temporary supply disruptions\u201d like the North Sea Forties and Libyan pipeline outages (and) protests across Iran ... helped create a record speculative long bet.\u201d  With pipeline outages resolved and protests in Iran showing no signs of affecting its oil production yet, Hansen said prices could fall in early 2018, especially with rising U.S. output.  \u201cIt is only a matter of time before the 10 million barrel per day (bpd) (U.S.) production target will be reached,\u201d Hansen said.  Supplies were healthy. U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has risen by almost 16 percent since the middle of 2016, hitting 9.75 million bpd at the end of last year.

          "body": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian court on Wednesday postponed a bail hearing for former Taliban hostage Joshua Boyle, who was arrested on Saturday and faces criminal charges including assault, sexual assault and forcible confinement.   The charges, filed on Monday, are for crimes prosecutors said occurred in Canada after Boyle and his family returned to the country last October. Boyle and his wife Caitlan Coleman were kidnapped in October 2012 while backpacking in Afghanistan.  When they returned to Canada with three children born in captivity, Boyle said a fourth child had been murdered and his spouse raped after their capture by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. The Taliban denied the accusations of rape and murder.   Boyle, 34, appeared in an Ottawa courtroom on Wednesday via video link dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit. He confirmed his name, but did not enter a plea to the charges.   He is due to appear again in court on Jan. 8.  The court imposed a publication ban that prevents media from reporting on information that could identify any victims or witnesses. The ban also prohibits reporting on the details of the bail hearing.\u00a0   The charges include eight counts of assault, two counts of sexual assault, two counts of forcible confinement and one count of uttering death threats.  Boyle has retained the services of Lawrence Greenspon, one of Canada\u2019s leading criminal defense lawyers.  \u201cMr. Boyle is presumed innocent of all charges. He has no criminal record and has never been in trouble with the police,\u201d Greenspon said in an e-mailed statement.  \u201cAs Mr. Boyle has only just been charged, we are waiting to receive more information about these allegations so that we can respond to them appropriately in court,\u201d Greenspon said. He declined to comment further.  A sign attached to the door of the Boyle apartment in Ottawa said family members would not be speaking to the media and requested privacy. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp posted a picture of the notice on its website.  U.S. officials said Boyle and his family spent almost all of their five years of confinement in neighboring Pakistan, which is where they were freed by Pakistani troops.  The family met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his Parliament Hill office last month. Photos released on Twitter showed Trudeau holding the youngest child in his lap.

          "body": "(Repeats to additional clients, no changes to text)  By Hugh Bronstein and Maximilian Heath  BUENOS AIRES, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Bus, train and subway fares in the Buenos Aires area will rise this year, the Argentine government said on Wednesday, despite fears that the increases will stoke already high inflation.  Fare increases on buses and trains will start in February, Transportation Minister Guillermo Dietrich told reporters, with an initial average rise of around 35 percent.  \u201cIn order to continue funding public works, we will update rates in a gradual, step-by-step manner,\u201d Dietrich said at a news conference. Subway rates are set to start rising in April.  The news came a week after Argentina changed its 2018 inflation target to 15 percent from the central bank\u2019s previous goal of 8-12 percent. Consumer prices rose 21 percent in the first 11 months of 2017, one of the world\u2019s fastest rates.  President Mauricio Macri was elected in 2015 on promises of freeing the economy from the tight controls favored by his predecessor. He reduced energy and transportation subsidies in a bid to simultaneously cut the fiscal deficit, lower inflation, attract investment and induce long-term economic growth.  Although higher transport fares in Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s most densely populated area, would put upward pressure on consumer prices, Goldman Sachs analyst Alberto Ramos said the fare increase would be positive in the long term.  \u201cIt will impact inflation in the short term but will keep it lower and contained in the future as prices and tariffs that reflect the cost of producing and supplying these services will attract more investment and will lead to better and cheaper services in the future,\u201d he said in an email.  \u201cIt is better to have real prices than hidden subsidies paid by society and non-users of those services,\u201d Ramos added.  The government aims to reduce its primary fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2018, down from 4.2 percent.  The inflation target revision was \u201ca long overdue recognition that the aggressive inflation targets were not compatible with a slow pace of fiscal adjustment,\u201d Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Nomura Securities International, said in a research note on Wednesday.

          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico City residents should be free to grow marijuana for personal use, a mayoral hopeful told Reuters on Wednesday, arguing that one of the world\u2019s largest cities should lead the charge to end prohibition in a country riven by drug violence.  The proposal would bring Mexico City in line with a global trend toward legalizing cannabis use, Salomon Chertorivski said in an interview, a few days after California launched legal sales of the drug for recreational use.  \u201cMy proposal is the legalization of private cultivation for personal consumption, not for sale, in homes in Mexico City,\u201d said the center-left Chertorivski, a former federal health minister and Mexico City government official who is one of three candidates seeking the ticket for a left-right coalition ahead of a mayoral election.  Opinion polls show the alliance in second place behind the left-wing Morena party, which has already chosen its likely candidate for the July 1 election.  Drug use should be a public health rather than a criminal matter, the 43-year-old Chertorivski said, adding that Mexico City should take a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach rather than follow the example of Portugal, which has decriminalized the use of hard drugs.   Mexico City, a megalopolis whose urban sprawl comprises more than 20 million people, has been at the vanguard of a shift in Mexico to more socially liberal laws in recent years. It led the way for several Mexican states to allow same-sex marriage, and was first to offer women abortions in most cases.  \u201cI am sure that this discussion will have the same luck,\u201d Chertorivski said.   Mexico has softened its drug laws in recent years, decriminalizing possession of small amounts of several drugs, although it retains harsh penalties for larger quantities.   Recreational marijuana is still broadly prohibited, but in 2015 the Supreme Court granted four plaintiffs the right to grow their own marijuana for personal consumption on human rights grounds. The country legalized the use of marijuana for medical and scientific needs in June.  Those milestones have helped stir debate in Mexico, where violent drug cartels have contributed to a death toll of at least 140,000 people over the past decade.  Chertorivski said legalizing cultivation would take business away from illegal gangs and keep marijuana users from drifting into criminal activity. He also proposed more than doubling the minimum wage to reduce crime.  Despite the trend toward legalization north of the border, cartels still make millions of dollars from smuggling marijuana into the United States.

          "title": "Surgery death rates in Africa are twice global average - study",
          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Death rates for patients undergoing surgery in Africa are double the global average even though they tend to be younger, scientists said on Wednesday, adding that many deaths were likely preventable.  Contributory factors include few specialists, poor hospital infrastructure and a lack of post-operative monitoring, they said in a study published in the Lancet medical journal.  \u201cPatients receiving surgery in Africa are younger than the global average, with a lower-risk profile and lower complication rates, and yet are twice as likely to die,\u201d the authors wrote.  The survey - the most comprehensive study of surgery in Africa - was funded by the Medical Research Council of South Africa and covered 247 hospitals in 25 countries.   It showed about one in five surgery patients developed a complication. Comparisons with international data for elective surgery showed that death rates from elective surgery were 1 percent in Africa compared with 0.5 percent for the global average.   Infections accounted for more than half of complications. The most common procedure was caesarian delivery.  The authors suggested many lives could be saved by improving patient monitoring during and after surgery.   They said a lack of crucial equipment and supplies hampered surgical care in Africa; a quarter of hospitals have no reliable oxygen source, a third do not have reliable electricity and nearly half do not have dedicated postoperative care.     Data showed there were just 0.7 specialists per 100,000 people in the study countries - around 30 times lower than the levels needed to reduce mortality.          Although the main aim of the study was to examine surgical outcomes, the authors said the most alarming finding was how few people actually received surgery.   An average of 212 operations per 100,000 people were performed in the study countries - 20 times lower than the level required to meet a country\u2019s surgical needs.  Although there was an urgent need to improve peri-operative care in Africa, the authors said the absence of surgery represented \u201ca silent killer that probably claims more lives\u201d.

          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - People who enjoy a few cocktails each week may be less likely to die from heart disease than people who rarely or never drink, especially if they\u2019re rich, a Norwegian study suggests.   For the study, researchers examined survey data on drinking habits and demographic characteristics for 207,394 adults in Norway. During an average follow-up of 17 years, 8,435 participants died of cardiovascular disease.  Compared to the participants who drank less than once a month, moderate drinkers who enjoyed alcoholic beverages two to three times a week were 22 percent less likely to die of heart disease during the study, researchers report in PLoS Medicine.   But money also mattered.   Among the most affluent people, moderate drinkers were 34 percent less likely to die from heart disease. But among the poorest participants in the study, the odds of death for moderate drinkers were just 21 percent lower than for nondrinkers.   \u201cWe knew that the risk of alcohol-related hospitalizations and deaths was higher among less affluent individuals on average, despite that they in general drink less frequently,\u201d said lead author Eirik Degerud of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in Oslo.  \u201cWe now see that that the proposed benefit of alcohol on the risk of cardiovascular disease is more pronounced among those more affluent,\u201d Degerud said by email. \u201cBut as there is no good reason why, mechanistically, alcohol should be more `protective\u2019 among those with an affluent background, we suspect that it is their affluent background that is the real reason behind the difference.\u201d  Being poor also appeared to worsen the risks of heavy drinking.   Among the least affluent participants, individuals who had four to seven cocktails a week were 42 percent more likely to die from heart disease than infrequent imbibers. Heavy drinkers were also 70 percent more likely to die of a stroke and 49 percent more likely to die from any cause.   Frequent binge drinking was also associated with a higher risk of death from heart disease, but it wasn\u2019t clear whether social class influenced these odds.  Researchers used just one measurement to reflect lifetime drinking habits, even though alcohol consumption might change over time.   Even so, the results add to evidence that the risk of premature death associated with poverty can be impacted by people\u2019s drinking habits, said Juergen Rehm, author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto.   \u201cThe findings indicate that the effects of alcohol differ depending on the socioeconomic position of the drinker,\u201d Rehm said by email.   Affluent people shouldn\u2019t think they can drink as much they like, however.   \u201cOne key message is that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption but that the risk differs based on other vulnerability factors often linked to socioeconomic status,\u201d Rehm added.    Beyond just cardiovascular health, there are other reasons to cut back on alcohol, including an increased risk of certain cancers.  Based on this study and others, Rehm advised, \u201cLess drinking is better for health.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly/2E1RpFy PLoS Medicine, online January 2, 2018. "

          "body": "(Adds comment from Australian Deputy PM)  KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S.-based seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity on Wednesday said it was moving a vessel closer to a possible search area for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 as it soon expects to be awarded a contract by Malaysia to resume the search.  The disappearance of the aircraft en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people aboard ranks among the world\u2019s greatest aviation mysteries. Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200-million ($157 million) search in January last year.  But in October, Malaysia said it was in talks with Ocean Infinity to resume the search on a \u201cno-cure, no-fee\u201d basis, meaning it will only get paid if it finds the plane.  \u201cOcean Infinity is hopeful of receiving the final contract award for the resumption of the search for MH370 over the coming days,\u201d a company spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement.  \u201cWith a relatively narrow weather window, we are moving the vessel, Seabed Constructor, towards the vicinity of the possible search zone. This is designed to save time should the contract award be forthcoming, as hoped,\u201d he said.  Reuters shipping data showed the Seabed Constructor left Durban, South Africa, on Tuesday and was headed to Perth, Australia, where it is due on Feb. 7.  Malaysia\u2019s deputy transport minister, Aziz Kaprawi, said the government was negotiating final terms of the agreement with Ocean Infinity and he was not aware of the vessel\u2019s movement.  \u201cWe are in the final stages of the decision. On our part, we have yet to finalise the agreement,\u201d he told Reuters.  When asked whether Australia and China would be consulted about the contract award, Aziz said: \u201cBasically, Malaysia will make the decision, as this offer was made to the Malaysian government. The cost will also be decided by Malaysia.\u201d  Australia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the plane may never be found.  \u201cI have, to be quite frank, some concerns as to whether it will be found,\u201d he told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio on Thursday.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen parts of the wreckage washing up on beaches in Madagascar and other parts a long way away from the arc in which we would presume to find it in, which might suggest that it broke up.\u201d  Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the transponder of the Boeing 777 before diverting it over the Indian Ocean.  Various pieces of debris have been collected from Indian Ocean islands and Africa\u2019s east coast and at least three of them have been confirmed as coming from the missing plane.

In the single biggest loss of military hardware for Russia since it launched air strike in Syria in autumn 2015, more than 10 servicemen were wounded in the attack by \u201cradical Islamists\u201d, the report said.  At least four Su-24 bombers, two Su-35S fighters and an An-72 transport plane, as well as an ammunition depot, were destroyed by the shelling, Kommersant said on its website, citing two \u201cmilitary-diplomatic\u201d sources.  Kommersant said the Russian defense ministry had not commented. Reuters was not able to immediately reach the ministry.  Earlier on Wednesday, the ministry said a Mi-24 helicopter had crash-landed in Syria on Dec. 31 due to a technical fault and two pilots died.  Last month, Russia began establishing a permanent presence at Hmeymim and a naval base at Tartous although President Vladimir Putin has ordered a \u201csignificant\u201d withdrawal of his military from Syria, declaring their work largely done.

          "title": "China December factory growth quickens to four-month high but confidence subdued: Caixin PMI",
          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China\u2019s manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December as factories cranked up production to meet a surge in new orders, a private business survey showed on Tuesday.   The reading suggested surprising resilience in the world\u2019s second-largest economy at the end of the year, though it was somewhat at odds with a much larger official survey on Sunday that pointed to a slight loss of momentum.  The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 last month, from 50.8 in November, and far outpacing economists\u2019 expectations for a slight dip to 50.6.  The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.  Analysts have expected some softening in China\u2019s manufacturing activity as a punishing crackdown on air pollution, a cooling property market and higher borrowing costs all start to weigh on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  That view appeared to be borne out by the official data at the weekend which suggested that production expanded in December at a slightly more modest pace.      But Caixin\u2019s findings showed output grew at the fastest pace in three months, bolstered by improving demand.  Total new orders at home and from abroad rose at the strongest pace since August, with the sub-index jumping to 53.0 in December from 51.8 the previous month.  The Caixin survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms which are believed to be more export-oriented.  While the official data pointed to a wobble in production, it also showed a pickup in overseas orders which should help support China\u2019s exporters in the next few months.  However, despite the increase in new work, the Caixin survey indicated manufacturers continued to shed staff in December and input costs continued to rise sharply, largely due to higher prices for raw materials.  Companies were able to pass on some of those cost increases to customers, suggesting broader inflationary pressures may intensify in China this year. The official data pointed to even stronger price rises.    China\u2019s vast industrial sector has reported strong earnings growth this year thanks to a year-long construction boom that has fueled demand and prices for building materials.  But government measures to tame rising housing prices and high debt levels are starting to weigh on property investment, while the boost from a massive infrastructure spree is starting to fade.   Beijing\u2019s war on winter smog has also disrupted manufacturing activity.  Some steel mills, smelters and factories in the north have been forced to curtail or halt production, though plants in other parts of the country may be ramping up production to fill the shortfall and gain more market share.   Despite the pickups in output and new orders, however, the Caixin survey showed business confidence in the 12-month outlook remained weak by historical standards. Respondents cited forecasts of relatively subdued client demand and changes to national policies, though no more details were provided.         \u201cManufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,\u201d Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.  \u201cHowever, we should not underestimate downward pressure on growth due to tightening monetary policy and strengthening oversight on local government financing.\u201d  Analysts have widely expected China will report slightly cooler economic growth in the fourth quarter after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion in the first nine months of the year, supported by the construction boom and robust exports.   Sources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilizing build-up of debt.

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google both discounted their virtual assistant speakers so deeply over the holiday shopping season that they likely lost a few dollars per unit, highlighting a sharply different strategy from Apple Inc  (AAPL.O) as it prepares its HomePod speaker, analysts said.  Both companies cut prices for the smallest version of their speakers, the Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home Mini, to as little as $29 from $50 for the U.S. holidays. Midlevel versions cost a bit more than twice as much.  Apple failed to ship its $349 HomePod speaker in 2017, as it initially planned, and said the device would go on sale in early 2018.  Apple aims to make a profit on the device itself and bolster sales of its $9.99 per month Apple Music subscription, analysts said. Apple\u2019s voice assistant Siri likely will focus on recommending new songs.  Amazon and Google, meanwhile, are eager to give consumers a taste of their respective digital assistants, Alexa and Google Assistant, at impulse-buy prices, hoping to lock in customers and profit from later sales of goods and data about buying habits.  The Home Mini and Echo Dot do not match the sound quality of the HomePod, but consumers may see less need for a superior, pricier speaker from Apple once they have a rival set up. Even the midlevel Amazon and Google devices were discounted to $79 over the holidays.  \u201cThat kind of pricing is great for consumers and bad for Apple,\u201d said Paul Erickson, a senior analyst with IHS Markit.  Some consumers might consider a $30 speaker to be cheap enough to throw away and not a barrier to buying the Apple device when it arrives.  Amazon declined to comment on Echo devices but said in a press release it sold millions of its Echo Dot speakers during the holiday season, making it the best-selling product over the period on its online store.  Google did not disclose sales numbers for the Home Mini, but Google Home spokeswoman Nicol Addison said the company was very happy with holiday performance. Google gave away the devices to buyers of its new Pixel 2 smartphones and offered them for $29 at Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy.   Amazon dominates the emerging market for smart speakers outside of China, with Google closest behind. Sales of the devices are not yet substantial enough to affect the financial results of either company.   Both companies took small losses or broke even on sales of the hockey puck-shaped devices, analysts estimated.  The Echo Dot has about $31 worth of parts, according to analysis by ABI Research. Components in the Google Home Mini cost about $26. The figures do not include overhead, shipping and other expenses, meaning discounted versions likely sold at a loss.  \u201cApple is in a bit of trouble,\u201d said Adam Wright, senior research analyst at IDC, who estimated that about 35 million smart speakers had been installed worldwide as of a couple of weeks ago - not including U.S. Christmas sales. \u201cWe\u2019ve witnessed an explosion in the last six months.\u201d  (This version of the story has been refiled to delete extra \u201csaid\u201d in paragraph nine)  Reporting by Paresh Dave and Stephen Nellis; editing by Peter Henderson and Grant McCool"

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron announced on Wednesday he would overhaul French media legislation this year to fight the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d on social media which he said was a threat to liberal democracies.  Macron has said he and his team were victims of fake news and a major data hack during his election campaign last year.   Since coming to office in May 2017, he has particularly pointed the finger at Russian media, accusing TV channel RT of sowing disinformation about him via its website and social media during the campaign.   \u201cIf we want to protect liberal democracies, we must have strong legislation,\u201d Macron said in a New Year\u2019s address to journalists, adding that the reform he envisaged would also change the role of France\u2019s media watchdog CSA.  \u201cAt election time, on internet platforms, the rules applying to content won\u2019t be exactly the same,\u201d Macron said.   \u201cThere will be increased transparency requirements for internet platforms regarding sponsored content, with the aim of making public the identity of those who place the ads and also limiting the amount of them.\u201d  A new emergency procedure in the event of fake news appearing would allow a judge to delete some content, close a user\u2019s account, or block access to a website, he said.      Macron, who has cut back on the close relations his predecessor, Francois Hollande, had with the media, said the authorities must keep their distance with the press.  \u201cThe closeness which we had on occasions got used to was, I think, neither good for those in government nor for the journalists,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt sometimes led to more importance being given to  backroom chatter than to official comments,\u201d he said, calling for a \u201chealthy distance\u201d to be maintained with the press.

          "title": "Investors ignore U.S. auto sales outlook, bet on pickups and SUVs",
          "body": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Most major automakers on Wednesday reported lower December U.S. sales and forecast weaker overall sales in 2018, but investors bid up shares in the sector on a bet that high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs will pull Detroit\u2019s automakers through any downturn.  The December numbers were above analyst expectations, lifting the shares of General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI). According to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of U.S. car and light truck sales in December fell to 17.9 million units from 18.2 million in December 2016.   Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a SAAR for December of 17.5 million units.  Investors were pleased GM had cut its inventory of unsold vehicles - a concern for the industry earlier in 2017 - at the end of December to 63 days supply unsold vehicles, beating its target of around 70 days supply.  But GM said it expects the industry to sell less than 17 million new vehicles in 2018. According Autodata, 2017 full-year sales hit 17.23 million units, down nearly 2 percent from an all-time U.S. record of 17.55 million units in 2016.   Automakers\u2019 challenges in 2018 include dealing with an ongoing shift in consumer preference away from passenger cars to more profitable pickup trucks and SUVs, and an influx of millions of nearly-new, off-lease vehicles that are cheaper than new vehicles.  Automakers are still assessing the potential impacts of rising interest rates and the sweeping tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress last month.   Charlie Chesbrough, chief economist at Cox Automotive,  owner of the Autotrader online automobile market and Kelley Blue Book car valuation service, said the group expects 2018 sales to hit 16.7 million units and rising interest rates are one of the industry\u2019s challenges this year as they increase monthly car payments.  \u201cThat\u2019s real money to consumers,\u201d Chesbrough said on a conference call.  Ford chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris said on a conference call that interest rates are a \u201cheadwind, but a very minor one.\u201d  Tax cuts, however, should be a \u201cnet positive\u201d for the industry, she added.    Scott Keogh, U.S. head of Audi AG (NSUG.DE), said that while tax cuts would help luxury consumers, new federal limits on local and state tax deductions could hurt sales in New York and Los Angeles, the two largest American luxury vehicle markets.     Consumer discounts also remain a concern for the industry. Discounts of more than 10 percent of a vehicle\u2019s sticker price can hurt resale values, in turn weighing on new vehicle sales. In December, auto consultancies J.D. Power and LMC estimated discounts had topped 10 percent for the 17th time in the last 18 months.  Mark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial consulting at consultancy AlixPartners LLP - which expects U.S. industry sales to drop to 16.6 million in 2018 - said so far high discounts have not hurt automakers too much, but pricing discipline is a real concern moving forward.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re really nervous about is if someone defects and adds $1,000 to the hood... and forces others to respond to protect market share,\u201d Wakefield said.   GM reported a 3.3 percent drop in sales in December, driven by a decline in lower-margin fleet sales to government agencies and rental car companies. GM\u2019s retail sales were up 1.8 percent.   The automaker said its average transaction price hit $35,400 in 2017, above the industry average of $31,600.  Ford reported a 0.9 percent increase in sales for December, fueled by a 17 percent increase in fleet sales. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said its retail sales were down 4 percent.   GM shares closed up 2.4 percent, Ford shares ended up 0.8 percent and Fiat Chrysler closed up 2.4 percent.  Fiat Chrysler posted an 11 percent sales decrease, with retail sales dropping 3 percent. Fleet sales slumped 42 percent, in line with a company strategy over the last year to cut back on this low-margin way to unload product.   Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said its sales fell 8.3 percent in December, with decreases across all segments.   Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) posted a 7 percent drop in sales in December, driven mostly by declining passenger car sales.   Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) reported a 9.5 percent drop in sales.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) on Wednesday agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle a U.S. class action corruption lawsuit, in what was said to be the biggest such payout in the United States by a foreign entity.   Petrobras denied any wrongdoing in the deal, which was one of the largest securities class action settlements in U.S. history. With the settlement, it will pay out more than six times what it has received so far under a Brazilian probe into bribery schemes that involved company executives and government officials.      The settlement, smaller than many analysts anticipated, was an important milestone for the oil firm as it tries to emerge from the scandal that has entangled two former Brazilian presidents and dozens of the country\u2019s corporate executives.  But the deal reduces chances the world\u2019s most indebted oil company will pay a dividend for 2017, much anticipated by investors who have not seen such a payment since 2014 when the scandal came to light, a source familiar with the matter said.   For the last four years Brazil has been rocked by the so-called Car Wash investigation into kickbacks from contractors to executives of state-run companies and politicians in return for public projects.   The settlement put an end to \u201cextremely high uncertainty\u201d about the company\u2019s potential liability, JPMorgan said in a client note, adding that it had expected a figure above $5 billion. Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion.     Petrobras preferred shares closed up nearly 0.91  percent to 16.70 reais. U.S.-traded shares (PBR.N) rose 2.52 percent at $10.97.  Moody\u2019s brushed off concerns about the impact of the fine on the company\u2019s balance sheet, noting it was expected to generate some $30 billion in cash this year and make capital investments of around $15 billion.  \u201cPetrobras\u2019 liquidity position is adequate and the payment of the agreed class action settlement amount is not a material concern,\u201d it said.   Jeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors, called the deal an \u201cexcellent result\u201d and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer in the United States.  The deal came as the U.S. Supreme Court was set to consider on Friday whether to hear Petrobras\u2019 appeal of a lower court decision certifying the case as a class action. Petrobras said it and the investors would ask the Supreme Court to put off considering the case while the settlement awaits approval.  If the Supreme Court does take the case, it could delay its resolution for years.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must still approve the accord.  Investors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies.  In a securities filing on Wednesday, Petrobras claimed it was a victim and denied wrongdoing, adding that it has only recovered 1.475 billion reais ($455.77 million) for itself from the Car Wash investigation.   But its market value has plunged as its central role in the scheme continues to be unwound by investigators.  Petrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States where 13 individual lawsuits remain open, following settlements in 20 other cases.   Some claims involving non-U.S.-based Petrobras securities purchased outside the United States also still remain.  The deal came days after Brazil\u2019s securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption.  The accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships, according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday.   Among the accused in CVM\u2019s filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli. Neither could be reached for comment.  The largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School\u2019s Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar advanced against key currencies on Wednesday after the release of minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, while world shares smashed records and Wall Street closed higher on investor optimism in the new year.  The dollar index .DXY rose 0.34 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.38 percent to $1.2011.  The euro fell to a session low versus the dollar after the release of minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. During the meeting, Fed policy makers decided to raise short-term interest rates for a third time in 2017.   According to the minutes, policymakers showed worry over the fate of currently low inflation and saw recent tax changes as providing a boost to consumer spending.  Fed officials also discussed the possibility that the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts or easy financial conditions could cause inflation pressures to rise, leading to some dollar-buying, analysts said.  \u201cThe debate is the same. You have strong growth and low unemployment on one side and surprisingly low inflation on the other side,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.  \u201cThey have been taking a middle-of-the-road on their policy approach, gradually raising interest rates and unwinding the balance sheet. They will continue the same tack.\u201d  The dollar had already snapped a three-week losing streak earlier on Wednesday, after stronger-than-forecast U.S. manufacturing and construction data.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.18 percent versus the greenback at 112.50 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3512, down 0.54 percent on the day.  Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.4452 percent, from 2.465 percent late on Tuesday.  The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 18/32 in price to yield 2.7824 percent, from 2.81 percent late on Tuesday.  Hawkish comments from two European Central Bank officials had sent yields higher on Tuesday, with the 10-year German Bund yield DE10YT=RR hitting a two-month peak and the five-year U.S. yield US5YT=RR reaching its highest level since April 2011.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.46 percent. In 2017, the index\u2019s best year since 2009, it set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value.  The benchmark S&P 500 breached the 2,700-mark for the first time on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also broke records as tech stocks climbed  amid indications of strong economic growth in the United States and abroad.  Wall Street held its gains after the release of minutes from the Fed\u2019s policy meeting last month.  \u201cI think pretty much everyone sort of thinks the Fed is on track to do what it has been saying it is going to do, which is not do anything this month and then raise at their mid-March meeting. Currently there is about a 75-percent probability for a March hike. I don\u2019t think anything that was said was outside of that assumption,\u201d said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading at derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 98.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,922.68, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 17.25 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,713.06 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 58.63 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,065.53.  In Europe, shares closed higher after a rising dollar boosted exporters and Wall Street records lifted optimism as new European market rules took hold.

          "body": "NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify has filed confidentially with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering and is targeting a direct listing in the first half of 2018 that would allow some longtime investors to cash out, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.   If Spotify, which was valued at as much as $19 billion last year, goes ahead with its plans, it would be the first major company to carry out a direct listing, an unconventional way to pursue an IPO without raising new capital.  A direct listing mainly eliminates the need for a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite an IPO along with many associated fees and could change the way companies approach selling shares to the public.   The confidential filing was initially reported by news outlet Axios.   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission now allows all companies, regardless of revenue, to file a draft IPO registration statement confidentially before they unveil their financials.  Spotify is the biggest global music streaming company and counts Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) as its main rivals. Reuters had previously reported Spotify was aiming to file for an IPO in late 2017 and list with the New York Stock Exchange early this year.  Spotify declined to comment.  Spotify was sued by Wixen Music Publishing Inc last week for allegedly using thousands of songs without a license and compensation to the music publisher. Wixen is seeking damages worth\u00a0at least\u00a0$1.6 billion.  Spotify intends to proceed with a U.S. direct listing in the first half of 2018 despite the lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the matter. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Allen & Co are helping arrange the listing, the source added.    The lawsuit is unlikely to have a major impact on Spotify\u2019s IPO, said Luke DeMarte, a copyright lawyer at Michael Best & Friedrich not involved. DeMarte said he expects Wixen to settle its case for far less than the damages it is seeking and that it is unlikely any of the publisher lawsuits go to trial.   \u201cIt is not in Wixen\u2019s interests or its constituents\u2019 interests to stop Spotify or really inflict harm on them because it is the main game in town for streaming,\u201d DeMarte said.   The company said in June it had more than 140 million active users while listing more than 30 million songs. Spotify last reported more than 60 million paid users, twice that of Apple Music, its closest rival.  Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Liana B.

          "title": "Petrobras to pay $2.95 billion to settle U.S. corruption lawsuit",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) on Wednesday agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle a U.S. class action corruption lawsuit, in what was said to be the biggest such payout in the United States by a foreign entity.   Petrobras denied any wrongdoing in the deal, which was one of the largest securities class action settlements in U.S. history. With the settlement, it will pay out more than six times what it has received so far under a Brazilian probe into bribery schemes that involved company executives and government officials.      The settlement, smaller than many analysts anticipated, was an important milestone for the oil firm as it tries to emerge from the scandal that has entangled two former Brazilian presidents and dozens of the country\u2019s corporate executives.  But the deal reduces chances the world\u2019s most indebted oil company will pay a dividend for 2017, much anticipated by investors who have not seen such a payment since 2014 when the scandal came to light, a source familiar with the matter said.   For the last four years Brazil has been rocked by the so-called Car Wash investigation into kickbacks from contractors to executives of state-run companies and politicians in return for public projects.   The settlement put an end to \u201cextremely high uncertainty\u201d about the company\u2019s potential liability, JPMorgan said in a client note, adding that it had expected a figure above $5 billion. Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion.     Petrobras preferred shares closed up nearly 0.91  percent to 16.70 reais. U.S.-traded shares (PBR.N) rose 2.52 percent at $10.97.  Moody\u2019s brushed off concerns about the impact of the fine on the company\u2019s balance sheet, noting it was expected to generate some $30 billion in cash this year and make capital investments of around $15 billion.  \u201cPetrobras\u2019 liquidity position is adequate and the payment of the agreed class action settlement amount is not a material concern,\u201d it said.   Jeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors, called the deal an \u201cexcellent result\u201d and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer in the United States.  The deal came as the U.S. Supreme Court was set to consider on Friday whether to hear Petrobras\u2019 appeal of a lower court decision certifying the case as a class action. Petrobras said it and the investors would ask the Supreme Court to put off considering the case while the settlement awaits approval.  If the Supreme Court does take the case, it could delay its resolution for years.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must still approve the accord.  Investors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies.  In a securities filing on Wednesday, Petrobras claimed it was a victim and denied wrongdoing, adding that it has only recovered 1.475 billion reais ($455.77 million) for itself from the Car Wash investigation.   But its market value has plunged as its central role in the scheme continues to be unwound by investigators.  Petrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States where 13 individual lawsuits remain open, following settlements in 20 other cases.   Some claims involving non-U.S.-based Petrobras securities purchased outside the United States also still remain.  The deal came days after Brazil\u2019s securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption.  The accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships, according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday.   Among the accused in CVM\u2019s filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli. Neither could be reached for comment.  The largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School\u2019s Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) offer to replace flagging batteries at a slashed rate could be a hurdle for iPhone unit sales in 2018 if more users take the deal over upgrading to a new device, Barclays analysts write in a note.  Apple\u2019s customers have not been very pleased since the company said last month it intentionally slowed down older iPhones with weakening batteries to prevent the handset from shutting off abruptly.  Following consumer outrage, Apple apologized and slashed the price of out-of-warranty replacement batteries to $29 from $79  for iPhone 6 or later models.  Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz says 77 percent of iPhone customers are using iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and SE, which means even a small percentage opting for battery replacement over upgrade could have meaningful impact on iPhone sales.  The company faces eight lawsuits filed in California, New York and Illinois over the issue.  Reporting by Nikhil Subba in Bengaluru"

          "title": "Investors ignore U.S. auto sales outlook, bet on pickups and SUVs",
          "body": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Most major automakers on Wednesday reported lower December U.S. sales and forecast weaker overall sales in 2018, but investors bid up shares in the sector on a bet that high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs will pull Detroit\u2019s automakers through any downturn.  The December numbers were above analyst expectations, lifting the shares of General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI). According to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of U.S. car and light truck sales in December fell to 17.9 million units from 18.2 million in December 2016.   Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a SAAR for December of 17.5 million units.  Investors were pleased GM had cut its inventory of unsold vehicles - a concern for the industry earlier in 2017 - at the end of December to 63 days supply unsold vehicles, beating its target of around 70 days supply.  But GM said it expects the industry to sell less than 17 million new vehicles in 2018. According Autodata, 2017 full-year sales hit 17.23 million units, down nearly 2 percent from an all-time U.S. record of 17.55 million units in 2016.   Automakers\u2019 challenges in 2018 include dealing with an ongoing shift in consumer preference away from passenger cars to more profitable pickup trucks and SUVs, and an influx of millions of nearly-new, off-lease vehicles that are cheaper than new vehicles.  Automakers are still assessing the potential impacts of rising interest rates and the sweeping tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress last month.   Charlie Chesbrough, chief economist at Cox Automotive,  owner of the Autotrader online automobile market and Kelley Blue Book car valuation service, said the group expects 2018 sales to hit 16.7 million units and rising interest rates are one of the industry\u2019s challenges this year as they increase monthly car payments.  \u201cThat\u2019s real money to consumers,\u201d Chesbrough said on a conference call.  Ford chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris said on a conference call that interest rates are a \u201cheadwind, but a very minor one.\u201d  Tax cuts, however, should be a \u201cnet positive\u201d for the industry, she added.    Scott Keogh, U.S. head of Audi AG (NSUG.DE), said that while tax cuts would help luxury consumers, new federal limits on local and state tax deductions could hurt sales in New York and Los Angeles, the two largest American luxury vehicle markets.     Consumer discounts also remain a concern for the industry. Discounts of more than 10 percent of a vehicle\u2019s sticker price can hurt resale values, in turn weighing on new vehicle sales. In December, auto consultancies J.D. Power and LMC estimated discounts had topped 10 percent for the 17th time in the last 18 months.  Mark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial consulting at consultancy AlixPartners LLP - which expects U.S. industry sales to drop to 16.6 million in 2018 - said so far high discounts have not hurt automakers too much, but pricing discipline is a real concern moving forward.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re really nervous about is if someone defects and adds $1,000 to the hood... and forces others to respond to protect market share,\u201d Wakefield said.   GM reported a 3.3 percent drop in sales in December, driven by a decline in lower-margin fleet sales to government agencies and rental car companies. GM\u2019s retail sales were up 1.8 percent.   The automaker said its average transaction price hit $35,400 in 2017, above the industry average of $31,600.  Ford reported a 0.9 percent increase in sales for December, fueled by a 17 percent increase in fleet sales. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said its retail sales were down 4 percent.   GM shares closed up 2.4 percent, Ford shares ended up 0.8 percent and Fiat Chrysler closed up 2.4 percent.  Fiat Chrysler posted an 11 percent sales decrease, with retail sales dropping 3 percent. Fleet sales slumped 42 percent, in line with a company strategy over the last year to cut back on this low-margin way to unload product.   Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said its sales fell 8.3 percent in December, with decreases across all segments.   Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) posted a 7 percent drop in sales in December, driven mostly by declining passenger car sales.   Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) reported a 9.5 percent drop in sales.

          "body": "(Reuters) - A British mobile advertising agency has sued Uber Technologies Inc to force the ride-hailing company to pay millions of dollars of bills that Uber had refused to pay after claiming that ads being generated were fraudulent.  Fetch Media Ltd filed its lawsuit on Tuesday in the same California federal court where Uber had sued Fetch in September, accusing the agency of billing it for nonexistent, nonviewable or fraudulent ads, and failing to pass back rebates and commissions.  Uber voluntarily dismissed that lawsuit on Dec. 22, two weeks after the case was reassigned to U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, and said it would instead pursue related claims in a San Francisco state court.  Ad fraud, sometimes called click fraud, is a persistent issue in online advertising, occurring when automated programs mimic legitimate users by clicking ads.  Fetch, a London-based unit of Japan\u2019s Dentsu Inc, suggested that Uber dismissed its federal case on concern it might lose after it was assigned to Rogers, who has overseen other litigation involving the San Francisco-based company.  In Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit, Fetch asked that Rogers be assigned to determine both companies\u2019 contractual responsibilities, and direct Uber pay more than $19.7 million of invoices still owed for 2017.  \u201cFetch does not believe that Uber can avoid federal-court scrutiny of its incorrect contract theories so easily,\u201d the company said.  Uber did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.  The Association of National Advertisers, a trade group, last May estimated that marketers would lose $6.5 billion in 2017 because of fake web traffic caused by \u201cbots.\u201d  Uber said in September that it had hired Fetch to place ads to encourage new riders to download the Uber app, and would pay for \u201clegitimate clicks\u201d that helped attract riders.  But it said Fetch wrongly claimed credit for app downloads that occurred without ads ever being clicked. Uber said it paid Fetch more than $82.5 million, but that Fetch\u2019s failure to stop  ad fraud contributed to at least $50 million of damages.  According to Uber, the alleged fraud surfaced in early 2017 as customers began complaining about where its ads appeared.  Uber said, in one example, it had asked Fetch not to place ads on Breitbart.com, the conservative news website run by Steve Bannon, a former strategist for U.S. President Donald Trump, but that ads appeared there anyway.  In court papers, Fetch called Uber a \u201cfaithless business partner,\u201d and said it had helped Uber monitor ad fraud despite not being contractually required. Fetch also said its work helped Uber register more than 35 million riders.  The case is Fetch Media Ltd v. Uber Technologies Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-00015.

          "title": "Dollar rallies after data, Fed minutes; world shares hold record highs",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar advanced against key currencies on Wednesday after the release of minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, while world shares smashed records and Wall Street closed higher on investor optimism in the new year.  The dollar index .DXY rose 0.34 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.38 percent to $1.2011.  The euro fell to a session low versus the dollar after the release of minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. During the meeting, Fed policy makers decided to raise short-term interest rates for a third time in 2017.   According to the minutes, policymakers showed worry over the fate of currently low inflation and saw recent tax changes as providing a boost to consumer spending.  Fed officials also discussed the possibility that the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts or easy financial conditions could cause inflation pressures to rise, leading to some dollar-buying, analysts said.  \u201cThe debate is the same. You have strong growth and low unemployment on one side and surprisingly low inflation on the other side,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.  \u201cThey have been taking a middle-of-the-road on their policy approach, gradually raising interest rates and unwinding the balance sheet. They will continue the same tack.\u201d  The dollar had already snapped a three-week losing streak earlier on Wednesday, after stronger-than-forecast U.S. manufacturing and construction data.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.18 percent versus the greenback at 112.50 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3512, down 0.54 percent on the day.  Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.4452 percent, from 2.465 percent late on Tuesday.  The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 18/32 in price to yield 2.7824 percent, from 2.81 percent late on Tuesday.  Hawkish comments from two European Central Bank officials had sent yields higher on Tuesday, with the 10-year German Bund yield DE10YT=RR hitting a two-month peak and the five-year U.S. yield US5YT=RR reaching its highest level since April 2011.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.46 percent. In 2017, the index\u2019s best year since 2009, it set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value.  The benchmark S&P 500 breached the 2,700-mark for the first time on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also broke records as tech stocks climbed  amid indications of strong economic growth in the United States and abroad.  Wall Street held its gains after the release of minutes from the Fed\u2019s policy meeting last month.  \u201cI think pretty much everyone sort of thinks the Fed is on track to do what it has been saying it is going to do, which is not do anything this month and then raise at their mid-March meeting. Currently there is about a 75-percent probability for a March hike. I don\u2019t think anything that was said was outside of that assumption,\u201d said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading at derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 98.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,922.68, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 17.25 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,713.06 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 58.63 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,065.53.  In Europe, shares closed higher after a rising dollar boosted exporters and Wall Street records lifted optimism as new European market rules took hold. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  was up 0.48 percent.   Emerging market stocks rose 0.53 percent.  Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.4 percent to $1,313.43 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.09 percent to $1,314.90 an ounce.  Oil prices hit fresh two-and-a-half year highs, with a sixth day of unrest in OPEC member Iran and strong economic data from the United States and Germany spurring buying.  U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 2.34 percent to $61.78 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $67.89, up 1.98 percent on the day.

          "body": "(Updates with share prices throughout, comment from MJIC)  By Nichola Saminather  TORONTO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Canadian cannabis stocks surged to new records on Wednesday as investors enthused over early growth of the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded fund focused on the pot industry and the Jan. 1 legalization of recreational marijuana in California.  Cannabis producers Canopy Growth Corp and Aphria Inc were among the biggest gainers on the Toronto Stock Exchange\u2019s S&P/TSX composite index, surging as much as 11.9 percent and 8.8 percent respectively, although they later pared some of those gains. Aurora Cannabis, Canada\u2019s second-biggest listed producer, closed up 20 percent. All hit record highs.  MJIC Inc's equal-weighted Canadian Marijuana Index, which tracks stocks of major cannabis companies, also hit a record and rose more than 14 percent. [here ].  Canada\u2019s Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF gained 10 percent. The U.S.-listed ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF , which began trading on Dec. 26, has risen to $164 million in net assets from $6 million in one week, according to Vahan Ajamian, an analyst at Beacon Securities in Toronto. Top Alternative Harvest holdings include Canadian weed producers Cronos Group Inc and Canopy.  \u201cIf Americans want to buy Canadian stocks in an easy way, this is the first ETF that provides that ability in the U.S.,\u201d Chris Damas, editor of the BCMI Cannabis Report, said in an interview.  Still, he cautioned that in his view the sector was in a bubble as foreigners were rushing to invest in the Canadian cannabis sector, causing demand to far outstrip supply.  Reports of long lines and product shortages in California, which legalized pot sales on Jan. 1, also helped the rally. Some investors see the launch of sales in Canada as a harbinger of what can be expected when Canada launches recreational sales in mid-2018.  To be sure, the only Canadian company with significant exposure to the California market is CannaRoyalty Corp, Ajamian said by email.  MJIC Vice-President Dan Nicholls said he expects a correction in the sector, given the steep gains.  \u201cWe saw a dramatic rise in trading volumes in the U.S. and Canada over the last week,\u201d he said. \u201cThis ... was likely tied directly to the California legalization as there has been little news of significance out of Canada during this time period.\u201d  \u201cMany investors likely invest in Canadian stocks given its better cannabis regulatory climate compared to the U.S. and expanding international opportunities,\u201d Nicholls added.

          "body": "DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen killed dozens of Houthi fighters and cut one of their main supply routes on Wednesday, United Arab Emirates state news agency WAM reported.  The offensive, northwest of Yemen\u2019s third largest city of Taiz, could be a major advance for the Western-backed coalition forces in nearly three years of civil war.  It would consolidate gains made last month at al-Khoukha on the Red Sea where pro-government forces, energized since the death of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh in December after he ditched his alliance with the Iran-aligned Houthis, made their biggest advance in months.  The Houthis, who swept across Yemen since 2014 overthrowing the internationally-recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2015, hold the capital Sanaa and much of northern Yemen,  where most of the country\u2019s 25 million people live.   The conflict - widely seen as a proxy war between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran - has displaced more than 2 million people, caused a cholera epidemic and pushed the country to the brink of famine. At least 10,000 people have been killed.  WAM said local Yemeni fighters, backed by UAE troops, raided Houthi strongholds between al-Khoukha and the town of Heys, about 25 km (15 miles) to the east to try to secure Red Sea areas captured last month.  \u201cEmirati armed forces members and Yemeni resistance fighters managed to cut supply lines for the Houthi coup militias between Hodeidah and Taiz south of Heys city,\u201d WAM said, citing an Emirati army source.  It said that dozens of Houthi fighters were killed.  Residents said that Houthi forces, who control most of Taiz province and surround pro-government forces inside the provincial capital, continue to receive supplies through the adjacent Ibb province.

Apple\u2019s customers have not been very pleased since the company said last month it intentionally slowed down older iPhones with weakening batteries to prevent the handset from shutting off abruptly.  Following consumer outrage, Apple apologized and slashed the price of out-of-warranty replacement batteries to $29 from $79  for iPhone 6 or later models.  Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz says 77 percent of iPhone customers are using iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and SE, which means even a small percentage opting for battery replacement over upgrade could have meaningful impact on iPhone sales.

          "title": "Winter storm challenges U.S. East Coast energy complex",
          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. energy industry was facing a massive test of its infrastructure as an intense winter storm roared up the Atlantic Coast, threatening power outages, refinery shutdowns and spikes in heating prices.  The storm swept the U.S. Southeast and headed toward New England on Wednesday, adding snow, freezing rain and strong winds to a record-shattering cold already affecting much of the eastern United States. Temperatures were expected to keep dropping throughout the weekend, according to private AccuWeather forecasts.  The cold weather punishing most of the country already caused Phillips 66  to shut a crude and coking unit at its Wood River, Illinois, refinery after a line froze followed by a brief fire, a source told Reuters on Wednesday.  Prices for heating oil and natural gas in the U.S. Northeast are at their highest levels in several years on the back of near-record heating demand.   The extreme cold has stoked fears that a significant disruption could lead to a heating oil shortage, as inventories of distillate products, including heating oil, in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions are at their lowest levels for this time of year since 2015. A number of tankers carrying diesel and heating oil from Europe are bound for the United States to address supply worries.  The U.S. Coast Guard in the key ports of Boston, New York Harbor and Philadelphia have deployed ice-breaking ships to help keep trade traffic moving, but delays were expected.  Gasoline and diesel futures have climbed above five-year highs for this time of year, boosting key refining margins to a five-year high for this time of year.  \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a big bang and price response but I don\u2019t expect the impact and price response to be as long lasting as what you saw during Hurricane Harvey,\u201d said John Auers, executive vice president at consultancy Turner, Mason & Co in Dallas.  Refiners along the U.S. East Coast were bracing for difficulties in the next few days. So far, the five refineries along the East Coast are dealing with frozen pipes and other challenges, but have not experienced any significant outages, according to sources at the plants.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of freeze-up but haven\u2019t lost any units. This weekend will be bad,\u201d said a source at Monroe Energy\u2019s 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery outside Philadelphia.  Monroe Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Although most refineries, particularly those in northern climates, are designed to operate throughout the winter, increasingly extreme weather conditions in recent years have tested their capabilities. In 2015, more than a third of the U.S. East Coast\u2019s capacity was abruptly shut down due to glitches.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions delayed a planned shutdown of a 50,000-bpd hydrotreater and a benzene unit at the Girard Point section of the Philadelphia refinery complex due to severe weather conditions, a source told Reuters on Wednesday.  Phillips 66 does not currently have a timeline for restarting the units at its Illinois plant, the source said.  U.S. natural gas demand was expected to remain near record highs this week due to the frigid weather. Natural gas is the major fuel for residential and commercial heating in the U.S. Northeast and is also widely used by power plants.  Total gas consumption in the lower 48 U.S. states peaked at 141.9 billion cubic feet per day on Monday, New Year\u2019s Day, and was expected to remain near that level all week, according to Thomson Reuters analysts.  One bcfd of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes.  Natural gas prices in New England last week jumped to $53.50 per million British thermal units, the highest since January 2014. The average price for gas in New England in 2017 was $3.80/mmBtu.  Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw, Jessica Resnick-Ault and Scott DiSavino; Editing by Alistair Bell"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Wednesday found a Turkish banker guilty of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions, after a nearly four-week trial that has strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey.  Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank (HALKB.IS), was convicted on five of six counts he faced, including bank fraud and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions law, in Manhattan federal court.  Atilla was also found not guilty on a money laundering charge.   Prosecutors had accused Atilla of conspiring with gold trader Reza Zarrab and others to help Iran escape sanctions using fraudulent gold and food transactions. Zarrab pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecutors.  In several days on the witness stand, Zarrab had described a sprawling scheme that he said included bribes to Turkish government officials and was carried out with the blessing of  current President Tayyip Erdogan.  Halkbank had no immediate comment. Attempts to reach Erdogan\u2019s spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful. Erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government.   In brief public remarks after the verdict was announced, Erdogan made no comment on the trial but a senior Turkish government official rejected the verdict.  U.S. prosecutors have criminally charged nine people, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, have been arrested by U.S. authorities.  \u201cForeign banks and bankers have a choice: you can choose willfully to help Iran and other sanctioned nations evade U.S. law, or you can choose to be part of the international banking community transacting in U.S. dollars,\u201d Joon Kim, the acting U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement after the verdict was read. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do both.\u201d       U.S. District Judge Richard Berman scheduled Atilla to be sentenced on April 11.      Victor Rocco, one of Atilla\u2019s lawyers, told reporters that the banker would ask Berman to overturn the verdict and would appeal if necessary.  \u201cWe believe he\u2019s innocent,\u201d Rocco said. \u201cWe intend, and he intends, most importantly, to continue to fight and clear his name.\u201d      The trial carried echoes of an investigation in Turkey in 2012 and 2013 that involved Zarrab and multiple government officials. One of the prosecutors\u2019 witnesses was a former Turkish police officer, Huseyin Korkmaz, who said he led that investigation.  Korkmaz said he was jailed in retaliation, and eventually fled to the United States, carrying evidence from his investigation with him.  A senior government official in Turkey said Wednesday\u2019s verdict was \u201cvoid.\u201d   \u201cWe consider this verdict void in every sense; international law has been violated,\u201d said the official, who declined to be named. \u201cIt cannot have a negative impact on the Turkish economy, banking system or Halkbank, specifically.\u201d      Last month, Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul demanded in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Korkmaz be returned to Turkey, calling him \u201ca fugitive, a terror suspect facing serious allegations.\u201d  The Turkish government has said that followers of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen were behind both the Turkish investigation and the U.S. case, as well as the 2016 failed coup in Turkey. Gulen has denied the accusations.              Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Additional reporting by Orhan Coskun in Ankara; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Alistair Bell"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It was too good to be true. Scientists have ruled out the most exotic explanation \u2014 an orbiting alien mega-structure \u2014 for the behavior of a celestial oddity dubbed Tabby\u2019s Star that has been puzzling scientists with its sporadic dimming and brightening.  Astronomers said on Wednesday that the most thorough study to date of the star, officially called KIC 8462852, showed that its dimming episodes are not caused by a large opaque object passing in front of it. The dimming could be due to some sort of dust, they added, though the cause remains uncertain.  The researchers relied on observations of Tabby\u2019s Star from March 2016 to December 2017 using Las Cumbres Observatory telescopes in Maui and the Canary Islands. The star is named after Louisiana State University astrophysicist Tabetha Boyajian, who was instrumental in identifying its idiosyncrasies in 2015.  Beginning in May 2017, the scientists observed four episodes when the star\u2019s light dipped. The data showed\u00a0less dimming in the star\u2019s red light than in its blue light, and a large opaque object would dim all colors of light equally when passing in front of a star, Boyajian said.  \u201cWe took measures of the star\u2019s brightness in several colors.\u00a0Data taken in this way can inform us on what kind of material is passing in front of the star,\u201d Boyajian added.  Numerous hypotheses have been offered about the star\u2019s occasional dimming, including a hypothetical mega-structure called a Dyson Sphere built to surround a star and harvest its energy output.  \u201cSure, it\u2019s disappointing that this isn\u2019t the anomaly that will turn out to be that big discovery.\u00a0But we always knew the chances were low. It\u2019s like finding out that your lottery ticket isn\u2019t a winner: disappointing, but not surprising,\u201d said another of the researchers, Penn State astrophysicist Jason Wright.  Tabby\u2019s star, roughly 40 percent more massive than the sun, is located about 1,280 light-years away from our solar system in the constellation Cygnus. Its light has been observed dimming as much as 22 percent.  The new observations were consistent with the effects of dust \u2014 fine grains of material \u2014 on the starlight, Wright said. There was no hint of gas along with the dust, Wright said.  \u201cWe still aren\u2019t 100 percent sure where the dust is, but it seems to be somewhere around the star,\u201d Wright added. \u201cWe\u2019re still not sure where it\u2019s coming from \u2014 maybe colliding asteroids or comets.\u201d  The findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Bitcoin was the star of the white-knuckle ride that cryptocurrencies offered in 2017 but lesser-known names, such as Ripple and Ethereum, are seen gaining prominence in 2018.  While bitcoin jumped more than 1,200 percent last year, Ripple, created by the founder of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, surged 35,000 percent in the same period.  That means $100 invested in Ripple in January 2017 would have grown to about $35,000 at the start of this year.  To be sure, bitcoin is still the biggest cryptocurrency by far - with market value exceeding $250 billion - and is expected to keep that mantle in the months to come.  Here is a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies - including bitcoin - and how they performed in 2017:  Ripple (XRP):  Launched in 2012, Ripple had a market cap of $91.79 billion as of Tuesday, second after Bitcoin. It is used by companies such as UBS (UBSG.S) and Santander (SAN.MC) as payment technology. In November 2017, American Express Co (AXP.N) also launched an instant blockchain-based payment system using Ripple.  Percentage gain in 2017: About 35,000 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: $2.73  Launched in 2015, NEM is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency platform. It is used in a commercial blockchain called Mijin, tested mainly in Japan, by financial institutions and private companies.

          "title": "Click bait ads are tied to teen smoking",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) - - Teens who engage with online tobacco ads are more likely to start smoking than their peers who aren\u2019t lured by digital marketing campaigns, a U.S. study suggests.  Twice, about a year apart, almost 12,000 adolescents were surveyed about their online and social media habits as well as their tobacco use.   At the start, most of the teens were online and using social media at least once a day. But 78 percent of them had never used tobacco, and 88 percent had not engaged with online tobacco ads by doing things like signing up for emails, watching videos, sharing links on social media or getting coupons.  Overall, 6 percent of the participants had used one tobacco product in the year leading up to the first survey and 16 percent had sampled more than one, the study found.   Among nonsmokers, the few participants who engaged with tobacco ads at the start of the study were 26 percent more likely to have started smoking and vaping by the end, researchers report in Pediatrics.  Among study participants who had already tried tobacco, those who also engaged with online ads were 58 percent more likely to become frequent users of cigarettes and other products by the end of the study and 29 percent less likely to attempt quitting.   \u201cOne possible influence of engagement with online tobacco marketing is to make teenagers curious about and wanting to try a tobacco product,\u201d said lead study author Samir Soneji, a researcher at Dartmouth College in Lebanon, New Hampshire.   \u201cCigarette ads are not allowed on television, but there are far fewer restrictions that would prevent tobacco marketers from marketing to children and teenagers online,\u201d Soneji said by email. \u201cUntil those regulations are in place, parents should educate their children about the dangers of tobacco, including e-cigarettes.\u201d  Adolescents in the study range in age from 12 to 17, and approximately one in three of them lived with a tobacco user.   The most common types of engagement were signing up for email alerts about tobacco products, reading articles online or watching videos, the study found. Some teens also used smartphones to scan quick response (QR) codes to enter a tobacco company sweepstakes or visited tobacco websites.   The study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how engagement with online tobacco ads might influence smoking or vaping habits, the authors note.   However, the results build on an extensive body of research showing that tobacco ads cause young people to start using tobacco products and become heavier users who are less motivated to quit, said Brian King, deputy director for research translation at the Office on Smoking and Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.   \u201cTobacco products are advertised using themes that can especially resonate with youth, including independence, rebellion, and sex,\u201d King, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cThe bottom line is that tobacco product advertising causes young people to start using tobacco products, irrespective of whether that advertising is made by traditional methods or newer methods such as the Internet.\u201d  Online marketing may be harder for parents to police than traditional formats like print or television, said John Pierce, a cancer prevention researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.   \u201cA major problem is that parents do not know when their child is being targeted by the tobacco industry advertising algorithms,\u201d Pierce said by email. \u201cCertainly we know that if the child clicks on any element of the ad, then that child will be further targeted by the tobacco industry.\u201d  To figure out what their kids are finding online, parents should ask them what type of ads are popping up in their social media accounts, Pierce advised.   \u201cIf they are honest with us, then we can discuss with them what the purpose of the advertising is and what the consequences of clicking on any component of the ad will be,\u201d Pierce said.

          "body": "(Corrects 6th paragraph to say refining margins are at five-year highs seasonally)  By Jarrett Renshaw  NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. energy industry is facing a massive test of its infrastructure as an intense winter storm roars up the Atlantic Coast, threatening power outages, refinery shutdowns and spikes in heating prices.  The storm swept up the U.S. Southeast toward New England on Wednesday, bringing snow, freezing rain and strong winds to a record-shattering cold already affecting much of the eastern United States. Temperatures are expected to keep dropping throughout the weekend, according to AccuWeather forecasts.  Prices for heating oil and natural gas in the U.S. Northeast are at their highest levels in several years on the back of near-record heating demand.  The extreme cold has stoked fears that a significant disruption could lead to a heating oil shortage, as inventories of distillate products, including heating oil, in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions are at their lowest levels for this time of year since 2015. A number of tankers carrying diesel and heating oil from Europe are bound for the United States to address supply worries.  The U.S. Coast Guard in the key ports of Boston, the New York Harbor and Philadelphia have deployed ice-breaking ships to help keep trade traffic moving, but delays are expected.  Gasoline and diesel futures have climbed above five-year highs for this time of year, boosting key refining margins CL321-1=R to a five-year high for this time of year.  \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a big bang and price response but I don\u2019t expect the impact and price response to be as long lasting as what you saw during Hurricane Harvey. Markets tend to over react,\u201d said John Auers, executive vice president at consultancy Turner, Mason & Co. in Dallas.  Refiners along the U.S. East Coast were bracing for difficulties in the next few days. So far, the five refineries along the East Coast are dealing with frozen pipes and other challenges, but have not experienced any significant outages, according to sources at the plants.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of freeze up but haven\u2019t lost any units. This weekend will be bad,\u201d said a source at Monroe Energy\u2019s 185,000 barrel-per-day refinery outside Philadelphia.  Monroe Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Although most refineries, particularly those in northern climates, are designed to operate throughout the winter, increasingly extreme weather conditions in recent years have tested their capabilities. In 2015, more than a third of the U.S. East Coast\u2019s capacity was abruptly shut down due to glitches.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions delayed a planned shutdown of 50,000 bpd hydrotreater and a benzene unit at the Girard Point section of the Philadelphia refinery complex due to severe weather conditions, a source told Reuters Wednesday.  U.S. natural gas demand was expected to remain near record highs this week due to the frigid weather. Natural gas is the major fuel for residential and commercial heating in the U.S. Northeast and is also widely used by power plants.  Total gas consumption in the lower 48 U.S. states peaked at 141.9 billion cubic feet per day on Monday, New Year\u2019s Day, and was expected to remain near that level all week, according to Thomson Reuters analysts.  One bcfd of gas is enough to fuel about five million U.S. homes.  Natural gas prices in New England NG-CG-BS-SNL last week jumped to $53.50 per million British thermal units, highest since January 2014. The average price for gas in New England in 2017 was $3.80/mmBtu. (Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw, Jessica Resnick-Ault and Scott DiSavino; Editing by Alistair Bell)"

          "body": "(Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) said it expects to report a fourth-quarter loss due to a $2.4 billion hit from the tax legislation which makes it cheaper for U.S. companies to repatriate profits.  The company also said it expects full-year 2017 earnings to be below its $5.80-$5.90 per share forecast. (bit.ly/2CyIWfT)  The impacts of the tax act in the fourth quarter will reduce American Express\u2019 regulatory capital and capital ratios for the fourth quarter, the company said.  In the long run, AmEx expects the lower corporate tax rate to be a significant benefit. The company anticipates effective tax rate in the low twenties before discrete tax items in 2018.

          "title": "Bannon calls Trump Jr. meeting with Russians 'treasonous': book",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon called a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians attended by Donald Trump Jr. and his father\u2019s top campaign officials \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic,\u201d according to excerpts of a new book seen by Reuters on Wednesday.  The explosive comments from a former close aide and far-right architect of Donald Trump\u2019s November 2016 election victory roiled the White House and the Republican president, who famously values loyalty in associates and employees. Trump fired Bannon from his White House post in August and split with him on Wednesday in a highly personal public repudiation.  \u201cSteve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,\u201d Trump said in a statement hours after Bannon\u2019s comments emerged.  In the book, Bannon expressed derision and astonishment over the meeting at Trump Tower in New York in which a Russian lawyer was said to be offering damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to the book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff.  Bannon also was quoted as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians who took part in the meeting to meet his father in Trump Tower. Trump Jr. arranged the meeting and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman,  Paul Manafort, also attended.  The June 9, 2016, meeting has become part of federal special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election. Trump has denied any such collusion.  \u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers,\u201d Bannon was quoted as saying in excerpts of the book seen by Reuters.  \u201cEven if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.\u201d  Bannon also was quoted as saying, \u201cThe chance that Don Jr. did not walk these jumos up to this father\u2019s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero.\u201d Jumo is a word meaning drunk.  When an intermediary proposed the meeting, saying the Russians were offering damaging information about Clinton, Trump Jr. responded in an email, \u201cI love it.\u201d  Bannon was incredulous about the meeting shortly after it was first revealed publicly, according to the book, concluding sarcastically, \u201cThat\u2019s the brain trust they had.\u201d  The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Trump Jr. on the Bannon comments, first reported by the Guardian.  The book, due out next Tuesday, was based on more than 200 interviews with Trump, senior White House staffers and confidantes conducted by Wolff, a contributing editor for The Hollywood Reporter, according to publisher Henry Holt.  In a New York magazine article on Wednesday adapted from the book, Wolff described a campaign team looking forward to losing, from Trump and his family to staffers angling for profitable jobs after the election.  When it became clear on election night that Trump would win, Donald Trump Jr told a friend that his father \u201clooked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania was in tears - and not of joy.\u201d      U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to try to help Trump win in part by hacking and releasing emails embarrassing to Clinton. Moscow has denied the allegation.  In the book, Bannon also said he believed the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow will focus on money laundering.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV,\u201d Bannon was quoted as saying.  Manafort and business associate Rick Gates, who also worked on Trump\u2019s campaign, pleaded not guilty in November to federal charges brought by Mueller including conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine\u2019s former pro-Russian government.  Bannon was scheduled to appear in the near future before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee and will likely be questioned about the Trump Tower meeting comments, a congressional official said.  Bannon became Trump\u2019s campaign manager in the months before the November 2016 election, but after the Trump Tower meeting. He served as chief White House strategist during the first eight months of Trump\u2019s turbulent presidency.  He was a driving force behind Trump\u2019s nationalist and anti-globalization agenda. After being fired in August, he returned to lead the far-right Breitbart News website.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States aims to collect \u201cactionable information\u201d that could allow it to pursue sanctions against Iranian individuals and organizations involved in a crackdown on protesters, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday.  The move is part of an effort by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to swiftly side with anti-government protesters who have rattled Iran\u2019s clerical leadership, including at the United Nations and through Trump\u2019s own proclamations of support.  Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards have deployed forces to three provinces to put down the protests, which began last week out of frustration over economic hardships suffered by youths and the working class.  The senior Trump administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to explain U.S. thinking about the protests, acknowledged that the demonstrations were unexpected and that Washington was actively collecting information about the Iranian crackdown.  The idea was to obtain information and \u201cto feed that into our sanctions designation machinery,\u201d noting that the Trump administration already had robust authority to target individuals or organizations for human rights abuses, censorship or for preventing the free assembly of protesters.  \u201cHuman rights, censorship, free assembly - we have existing authorities that we can bring into action. That requires information,\u201d the official said.  \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of information out there so we intend to start assembling that and see what we can do.\u201d  Anti-government rallies, held in defiance of the pervasive security services, have called for the downfall of the Islamic Republic, posing one of the most sustained challenges to the established order of the major oil-exporting state since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed Shah.  The protests have heaped pressure on President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who championed a deal struck with world powers in 2015 to curb Iran\u2019s disputed nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions.  The U.S. official left open the possibility that protests may initially been tied to Rouhani\u2019s more conservative opponents, but said it quickly morphed into a spontaneous, broader uprising that caught Tehran off-guard.  Many of the protesters are fuming over what they see as the failure so far of Rouhani\u2019s government to deliver on promises of more jobs and investment as a dividend of the nuclear accord.  The U.S. official said the United States believed that Iranians were upset that a disproportional amount of the sanctions relief was directed toward state security services.  Still, it was unclear how the protests might affect Trump\u2019s thinking about the 2015 nuclear pact that eased economic pressure on Tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.  Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports under the terms of the  international deal.  If he reimposes sanctions on oil, it could increase the economic pain for Iran\u2019s leaders. But analysts said it could also send the wrong message about U.S. support for Iran\u2019s people in the middle of the boldest challenge to the leadership in a decade.  Asked about those sanctions, the U.S. official said no decision had been reached.  \u201cWe have some time,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing options for the president. It\u2019s just too soon to say.\u201d  Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by James Dalgleish"

          "title": "New SCOTUS brief: no circuit split on standing in data breach class actions",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Circuit splits, like beauty, can be in the eye of the beholder.  Last October, I told you about a petition for U.S. Supreme Court review by the health insurer CareFirst, which asked the justices to clarify constitutional standing requirements for plaintiffs exposed in corporate data breaches. CareFirst\u2019s lawyers at Eversheds Sutherland argued that the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which revived a data breach class action against the insurer, applied an overly permissive interpretation of constitutional standing requirements that is at odds with decisions by the 3rd, 4th and 8th Circuits, which have held that the mere theft of personal information does not give plaintiffs a right to sue.  CareFirst said the lower courts are in such disarray that judges in different circuits have reached opposite conclusions in competing class actions stemming from the exact same data breach. \u201cLower courts have struggled to consistently apply Article III standing principles to future injuries allegedly caused by data theft, including the increased risk of future identity theft,\u201d its Supreme Court petition said. \u201cWithout guidance, courts, litigants, cybersecurity insurers and corporate America will remain uncertain as to when a federal court can hear such claims.\u201d  Or not, according to a newly filed brief opposing Supreme Court review in the CareFirst case. The brief, by lawyers for the plaintiffs suing CareFirst, contends the much-ballyhooed (by me, among others) circuit split on standing in data breach class actions is a mirage.  In fact, according to plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers from Paulson & Nace, Nidel & Nace and the Giatras Law Firm, the federal circuits all agree on how to interpret Supreme Court precedent on constitutional standing. The circuits may have reached different conclusions about standing in particular data breach class actions, the new brief said, but those conclusions were based on particular facts, not on the law.  \u201cA review of these opinions does not demonstrate a split, but only that the courts are applying the facts to the appropriate precedent to weed out only those cases that do not meet the Article III standards the court has long identified,\u201d the new Supreme Court brief said. \u201cNot a single case cited by petitioners suggests a split on the legal issue.\u201d  The brief addressed three circuit court rulings that held data breach victims do not have standing based only on the theft of their personal information. The 3rd Circuit\u2019s 2011 decision in Reilly v. Ceridian predates the Supreme Court\u2019s latest precedent on standing and imminent threat of injury, 2013\u2019s Clapper v. Amnesty International\u00a0and 2014\u2019s Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus. After the Supreme Court clarified the test for standing, the new brief said, the 3rd Circuit revised its analysis in a 2017 decision\u00a0holding that plaintiffs in a data breach class action against Horizon Healthcare had standing based only on alleged violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  Similarly, the CareFirst plaintiffs said, the 4th Circuit held last year, in Wikimedia v. NSA\u00a0that data misappropriation can confer constitutional standing, despite its earlier decision in Beck v. McDonald\u00a0that the mere risk of identity theft is not concrete enough to give data breach victims standing to sue. And even in the Beck decision, the CareFirst plaintiffs\u2019 brief said, the 4th Circuit based its holding on the premise that no plaintiffs alleged their stolen data had actually been misused. That fact pattern distinguished the data breach class action at the 4th Circuit from the CareFirst case and others in which federal circuits have found the risk of identity theft sufficient to establish standing.  Finally, the CareFirst plaintiffs\u2019 Supreme Court brief quoted the 8th Circuit\u2019s own language in 2017\u2019s In re SuperValu, which it concedes to be the best evidence of a split amongst the circuits on standing for data breach victims. But the big problem with that evidence, according to the opposition brief, is that the 8th Circuit said all of the circuit rulings \u201cultimately turned on the substance of the allegations before each court,\u201d so the different outcomes \u201cneed not\u201d be reconciled.  Computer hackers have compromised personal information belonging to scores, if not hundreds, of millions of Americans. All of them are likely to be members of data breach class actions (whether they know it or not). So far, as I\u2019ve said many times, consumer class actions based on the theft of personal data have not produced big-money damages. But these cases affect more people than any other class actions I can think of.  The Supreme Court has already ducked a big class action issue this term, when it declined to take up the issue of ascertainability and class certification. The CareFirst plaintiffs seem to be banking on the court\u2019s disinclination to discern a circuit split when there may not actually be one. The views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News."

The dollar index rose 0.33 percent, with the euro down 0.36 percent to $1.2013.  The euro fell to a session low versus the dollar after the release of minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. During the meeting, Fed policy makers decided to raise short-term interest rates for a third time in 2017.  According to the minutes, policymakers showed worry over the fate of currently low inflation and saw recent tax changes as providing a boost to consumer spending.  \u201cI would say there\u2019s a little bit of a hawkish tilt in the minutes here,\u201d said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis.  \u201cIf you think about some of the stuff from the previous statement, there wasn\u2019t a ton of change. Really, I think the discussion is centered around the inflation topic.\u201d  The dollar had already snapped a three-week losing streak earlier on Wednesday, after stronger-than-forecast U.S. manufacturing and construction data.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.21 percent versus the greenback at 112.53 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3512, down 0.54 percent on the day.  Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.4471 percent, from 2.465 percent late on Tuesday.  The 30-year bond last rose 16/32 in price to yield 2.7855 percent, from 2.81 percent late on Tuesday.  Hawkish comments from two European Central Bank officials sent yields higher on Tuesday, with the 10-year German Bund yield hitting a two-month peak and the five-year U.S. yield reaching its highest level since April 2011.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.40 percent. In 2017, the index\u2019s best year since 2009, it set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value.  U.S. equities also climbed to fresh highs on Wednesday, propelled by tech stocks. The benchmark S&P 500 breached the 2,700-mark for the first time, while the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also broke records.  Wall Street held its gains after the release of minutes from the Fed\u2019s policy meeting last month.  \u201cIt emphasizes the message they\u2019ve had out there, that they\u2019ll be data dependent and that they want to try to normalize policy unless there\u2019s an economic slowdown or inflation doesn\u2019t act as expected,\u201d said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 63.51 points, or 0.26 percent, to 24,887.52, the S&P 500 gained 14.59 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,710.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 53.77 points, or 0.77 percent, to 7,060.67.  Technology companies Oracle and IBM rose 2.43 percent and 2.87 percent, respectively, following brokerage upgrades. The shares helped boost the S&P technology index 0.93 percent.  Tuesday, the first day of trading in 2018, saw a strong start for the indices, with the S&P and the Nasdaq hitting record closing highs.  In Europe, shares closed higher on Wednesday after a rising dollar boosted exporters and Wall Street records lifted optimism as new European market rules took hold. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.48 percent.  Meanwhile, MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.47 percent higher as manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy.  Emerging market stocks rose 0.58 percent, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 0.08 percent.  Elsewhere, spot gold reached its highest since mid-September on Wednesday, before edging back to $1,312.51 per ounce.  Oil prices hit fresh two-and-a-half year highs as strong output in the United States and Russia balanced tensions from a sixth day of unrest in OPEC member Iran.  U.S. crude rose 2.2 percent to $61.70 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.83, up 1.89 percent on the day.

          "body": "MONTREAL, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Canada\u2019s Bombardier Inc delivered 17 CSeries jets in 2017, missing its latest target of 20 to 22 planes, but is confident it can achieve its 2018 target of 40 deliveries, a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday, after engine delays hampered its ability to deliver orders last year.  More details on Bombardier\u2019s 2017 deliveries will be disclosed when the company announces its financial results in February, spokeswoman Nathalie Siphengphet said by phone.  The 110-to-130 seat CSeries jets sell for between $79.5 million and $89.5 million based on list prices.  Investors closely watch figures on aircraft orders and deliveries to help them accurately estimate revenues since airlines make the bulk of payments when planes are delivered.  Bombardier in November cut its CSeries delivery guidance by about a third, from 30 planes to a range of 20 to 22, citing delays from engine supplier Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp.  Pratt & Whitney in October disclosed that it had slowed production of its Geared Turbofan (GTF) to make them more durable after some of its customers had problems with the line of fuel-saving engines used in narrowbody jets.  Bombardier is \u201cconfident\u201d in the fixes from Pratt & Whitney and expects to meet its forecast of delivering 40 CSeries planes in 2018, Siphengphet said.  Two aerospace analysts told Reuters they believe Bombardier\u2019s goal of 40 deliveries is achievable, provided the supply chain woes are indeed fully fixed.  \u201cSo far it looks OK, but again, it\u2019s very early,\u201d said AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray by phone.  In late December, Bombardier said it finalized a letter of intent signed in November with EgyptAir for 12 CSeries planes, the first completed order received by Bombardier for the single-aisle jets after a 1-1/2-year sales drought.  It\u2019s not clear when a second letter of intent signed in November from an undisclosed European customer for 31 CSeries jets will be finalized. The order was initially expected to be completed by the end of 2017.  Reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Cynthia\nOsterman"

          "body": "(Updates throughout, adds quotes from DEP and ETP and background)  Jan 3 (Reuters) - Environmental regulators in Pennsylvania on Wednesday ordered Energy Transfer Partners LP\u2019s (ETP) Sunoco Pipeline unit to stop work again on its Mariner East 2 natural gas liquids pipeline after numerous violations of its construction permits.  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) said the $2.5 billion project\u2019s permits will be suspended until Sunoco addresses concerns outlined in the order.  \u201cUntil Sunoco can demonstrate that the permit conditions can and will be followed, DEP has no alternative but to suspend the permits,\u201d DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell said in a statement.  Those conditions include addressing all impacts on private water wells in Silver Spring Township in Cumberland County near Harrisburg, the state capital, identifying all in-progress or upcoming construction activities and submitting a detailed operations plan.  Jeff Shields, a spokesman for the Mariner East project, said in an email that ETP intends to \u201cexpeditiously submit\u201d the reports the DEP is seeking and noted the company was \u201cconfident that we will be reauthorized to commence work on this project promptly.\u201d  Shields could not say whether the latest order to stop work would affect the project\u2019s already delayed completion schedule.  Before the DEP\u2019s order on Wednesday, ETP had expected to complete the project in the second quarter of 2018.  That was delayed from the third quarter of 2017 before the DEP last ordered the company to stop some work on the project in July following fluid spills from horizontal directional drilling activities that adversely affected some drinking water supplies, among other things.  Energy companies use horizontal drilling to cross under obstacles like roads and rivers.  After reaching an agreement with the state to restart work on the pipeline, the company said in August it expected to complete the project during the fourth quarter of 2017.  Mariner East 2 is just one of ETP\u2019s projects, which include the Dakota Access crude line from North Dakota to Illinois and the Rover natural gas pipe from Pennsylvania to Michigan, that has come under intense regulatory scrutiny for environmental reasons over the past year.  Once complete, Mariner East 2 will expand the total takeaway capacity of the Mariner East project to 345,000 barrels per day to move propane, ethane and butane from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to customers in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, including ETP\u2019s Marcus Hook industrial complex near Philadelphia, according to ETP\u2019s website.

          "body": "OSLO (Reuters) - Norway has suspended exports of weapons and ammunition to the United Arab Emirates over concerns they could be used in the war in Yemen, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.  The UAE is part of a Saudi-led coalition formed in 2015 to fight the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa, in a war that has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than 3 million.  While there is no evidence that Norwegian-made ammunition has been used in Yemen, there was a rising risk related to the UAE\u2019s military involvement there, the ministry said.  \u201cThe decision reflects the strict precautionary approach taken by Norway,\u201d it added.  Existing export permits had been temporarily revoked and no new licenses would be issued under the current circumstances. The decision was made on Dec. 19, but was not made public until Wednesday.  In 2016, Norwegian exports of weapons and ammunition to the UAE rose to 79 million Norwegian crowns ($9.7 million) from 41 million in 2015, Statistics Norway data showed.  Human rights groups and several members of Norway\u2019s parliament have for months campaigned for a halt in arms exports to the UAE.  \u201cIt is fantastic that the government finally has taken responsibility to end weapons exports to a country which is active in the bombing of schools and hospitals in Yemen,\u201d said Line Hegna, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian branch of charity Save the Children.  \u201cFurthermore, we are hopeful that the decision taken by the Norwegian government can act as an example for other exporting nations to act responsibly in the face of repeated violations of international humanitarian law,\u201d she added.  Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang on Tuesday published what it said was video footage of a small remote-operated submarine captured by Houthi rebels and produced by Norwegian defense contractor Kongsberg Gruppen.  \u201cThis submarine has been seized in Yemeni waters and it belongs to the Saudi-American enemy,\u201d a voice in the video said.      Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the footage.      Kongsberg Gruppen, which is 50 percent owned by the Norwegian government, declined to comment on the Verdens Gang story, while the foreign ministry said it had no knowledge of the vessel\u2019s origins.  The Houthi news agency al-Masirah published similar video footage on Jan. 1 which it said showed the capture of a military reconnaissance submersible device by their naval frogmen. It did not specify the origin of the device or refer to Norway in its report.  The sale of arms to Saudi Arabia and other coalition members has also stirred debate in other European countries, including Britain. Last July, London\u2019s High Court rejected a claim by campaigners that billions of dollars\u2019 worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia should be halted because they were being used in Yemen in violation of international humanitarian law.  The Department for International Trade said on Wednesday that the British government \u201coperates one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world\u201d.  \u201cWe rigorously examine every application, including those from the UAE, on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. We will not grant a license if to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria,\u201d a spokesperson said.   The opposition Labour party, however, said it would continue to call for the suspension of all British arms sales to Saudi Arabia \u201cuntil there is evidence of a complete halt to the use of British weapons against any civilian population\u201d.   While weapons exports to the UAE have been allowed since 2010, Norway does not permit sale of arms or ammunition to Saudi Arabia.  The Norwegian parliament\u2019s foreign relations committee is due to debate the country\u2019s arms sales later this month.  UAE officials were not immediately available for comment.

Human rights groups and several members of Norway\u2019s parliament have for months campaigned for a halt in arms exports to the UAE.  \u201cIt is fantastic that the government finally has taken responsibility to end weapons exports to a country which is active in the bombing of schools and hospitals in Yemen,\u201d said Line Hegna, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian branch of charity Save the Children.  \u201cFurthermore, we are hopeful that the decision taken by the Norwegian government can act as an example for other exporting nations to act responsibly in the face of repeated violations of international humanitarian law,\u201d she added.  Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang on Tuesday published what it said was video footage of a small remote-operated submarine captured by Houthi rebels and produced by Norwegian defense contractor Kongsberg Gruppen.  \u201cThis submarine has been seized in Yemeni waters and it belongs to the Saudi-American enemy,\u201d a voice in the video said.      Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the footage.      Kongsberg Gruppen, which is 50 percent owned by the Norwegian government, declined to comment on the Verdens Gang story, while the foreign ministry said it had no knowledge of the vessel\u2019s origins.  The Houthi news agency al-Masirah published similar video footage on Jan. 1 which it said showed the capture of a military reconnaissance submersible device by their naval frogmen. It did not specify the origin of the device or refer to Norway in its report.  The sale of arms to Saudi Arabia and other coalition members has also stirred debate in other European countries, including Britain. Last July, London\u2019s High Court rejected a claim by campaigners that billions of dollars\u2019 worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia should be halted because they were being used in Yemen in violation of international humanitarian law.  The Department for International Trade said on Wednesday that the British government \u201coperates one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world\u201d.  \u201cWe rigorously examine every application, including those from the UAE, on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. We will not grant a license if to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria,\u201d a spokesperson said.   The opposition Labour party, however, said it would continue to call for the suspension of all British arms sales to Saudi Arabia \u201cuntil there is evidence of a complete halt to the use of British weapons against any civilian population\u201d.   While weapons exports to the UAE have been allowed since 2010, Norway does not permit sale of arms or ammunition to Saudi Arabia.  The Norwegian parliament\u2019s foreign relations committee is due to debate the country\u2019s arms sales later this month.  UAE officials were not immediately available for comment.

          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - A company that planned to build a coal export terminal in the Pacific Northwest to ship western U.S. coal to Asian markets sued the state of Washington on Wednesday for blocking construction last year.  Lighthouse Resources Inc filed a lawsuit in federal court against Washington Governor Jay Inslee and two state regulators for allegedly violating the U.S. Constitution\u2019s commerce clause by denying permits to allow the company to ship coal mined in Wyoming, Montana and other western states through its proposed Millennium Bulk Terminal to clients in Japan and South Korea.  The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Tacoma, claims that state regulators \u201cunreasonably\u201d refused to process permits to develop a site on the Columbia River where an existing Washington state lease allows coal exports.  Lighthouse, a privately held company based in Salt Lake City, says that by rejecting necessary permits, regulators imposed an \u201cembargo\u201d on new coal exports and discriminated against Lighthouse\u2019s efforts to transport coal mined in Montana and Wyoming through Washington.  The commerce clause gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce to prevent economic battles between states.  Lighthouse, which is the parent company of the Millennium Bulk Terminals and whose subsidiary companies own coal mines in Wyoming and Montana, accused Washington state officials of being \u201cphilosophically opposed to coal.\u201d  \u201cBut that does not give them legal authority to discriminate against this project and block foreign trade and interstate commerce,\u201d said Everett King, chief executive officer of Lighthouse Resources.  Lighthouse is also seeking a declaration by the court that the state\u2019s denial is unlawful and an order directing the state to continue processing any and all current and future permit applications.  The company also said that since the coal its subsidiaries are mining are on federally leased land, preventing exports to customers in Japan and South Korea keeps the companies from achieving \u201cmaximum economic recovery for minerals.\u201d  Washington state\u2019s Department of Ecology denied a key water quality permit for the Millennium Coal Terminal, blocking what would be the largest coal export terminal in the United States. The agency said the export terminal would cause environmental harm in nine key areas, from air quality to vessel traffic.  It was the last of six proposed coal terminals in the Pacific Northwest that was denied approval by state regulators or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers amid opposition from states and the Lummi Tribe, which argued that coal terminals interfered with their fishing rights.

          "body": "NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify has filed confidentially with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering and is targeting a direct listing in the first half of 2018 that would allow some longtime investors to cash out, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.   If Spotify, which was valued at as much as $19 billion last year, goes ahead with its plans, it would be the first major company to carry out a direct listing, an unconventional way to pursue an IPO without raising new capital.  A direct listing mainly eliminates the need for a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite an IPO along with many associated fees and could change the way companies approach selling shares to the public.   The confidential filing was initially reported by news outlet Axios.   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission now allows all companies, regardless of revenue, to file a draft IPO registration statement confidentially before they unveil their financials.  Spotify is the biggest global music streaming company and counts Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) as its main rivals. Reuters had previously reported Spotify was aiming to file for an IPO in late 2017 and list with the New York Stock Exchange early this year.  Spotify declined to comment.  Spotify was sued by Wixen Music Publishing Inc last week for allegedly using thousands of songs without a license and compensation to the music publisher. Wixen is seeking damages worth\u00a0at least\u00a0$1.6 billion.  Spotify intends to proceed with a U.S. direct listing in the first half of 2018 despite the lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the matter. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Allen & Co are helping arrange the listing, the source added.    The lawsuit is unlikely to have a major impact on Spotify\u2019s IPO, said Luke DeMarte, a copyright lawyer at Michael Best & Friedrich not involved. DeMarte said he expects Wixen to settle its case for far less than the damages it is seeking and that it is unlikely any of the publisher lawsuits go to trial.   \u201cIt is not in Wixen\u2019s interests or its constituents\u2019 interests to stop Spotify or really inflict harm on them because it is the main game in town for streaming,\u201d DeMarte said.   The company said in June it had more than 140 million active users while listing more than 30 million songs. Spotify last reported more than 60 million paid users, twice that of Apple Music, its closest rival.  Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Liana B.

          "body": "WARSAW, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Poland is in talks with Hungary to create a development bank aimed at investments in infrastructure in the region and plans to involve Slovakia and the Czech Republic in the project, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Wednesday.  Morawiecki met his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban in Budapest to discuss economic and political co-operation, including European Union migration quotas which they oppose, as well as issues regarding energy and the next EU budget.  \u201cWe talked about a Visegrad development bank. We can afford a bank that would support infrastructure development in the region,\u201d Morawiecki told reporters after his Budapest trip, referring to a group of central European countries comprising Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic.  \u201cWe strongly confirmed (with PM Orban) that we\u2019re interested. If Czechs and Slovaks respond positively we could quickly set up this bank,\u201d he said without providing more details.  Morawiecki also said his cabinet had not changed its sceptical view about adopting the euro in the near future despite recent calls from local economists trying to convince the Polish government to join the euro zone soon and keep Poland close to the core of the EU.  \u201cWe have not changed our rhetoric with regard to this. This is not an issue today,\u201d Morawiecki said.  Morawiecki and Orban appeared to have struck up a good personal relationship, reinforcing their countries\u2019 diplomatic rapprochement within the EU.  When the EU\u2019s executive body launched an unprecedented legal action against Warsaw in December in an attempt to force it to reverse judicial reforms that Brussels says undermine democracy, Orban signalled he would use Hungary\u2019s right of veto to block any punitive sanctions against Poland.  \u201cWe are like-minded countries,\u201d Morawiecki said when asked if Poland offered anything to Hungary in exchange for Orban\u2019s gesture and added that Budapest could rely on Poland in the future.  Both Orban\u2019s Fidesz and the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) in Poland are riding high in national opinion polls, thanks to their strong economic record, tough anti-migrant policies and their defiance of EU institutions.  Critics say reforms introduced by Fidesz in Hungary and by PiS in Poland are eroding democracy and the rule of law, charges rejected by Budapest and Warsaw.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Think of the stock market right now as a high-school cafeteria. The most popular kids in school are growth investors, high-fiving and riding a multi-year bull run.  Meanwhile, the geeky kids off to the side, eating lunch by themselves, are the value investors.  But those geeks often end up on top as adults. So even in this growth-oriented economy, you would be wise to have a value component to your portfolio.  For a double bargain, look to value-driven exchange-traded funds, which not only offer rock-bottom management fees but in some cases have been matching or even exceeding the broader market in gains.  \u201cGiven how strong a bull market we have had, there will be an inevitable rotation to value,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at independent advisory firm CFRA. \u201cIn fact, value has already showing signs of improvement.\u201d  Take the Deep Value ETF from TWM funds. As the name implies, the fund contains in its top 10 holdings the stocks of a number of firms that have been battered, most notably in retail, including Macy\u2019s Inc, Target Corp, Kohls Corp and Gap Inc.   Also represented in the Deep Value fund are some long-in-the-tooth tech firms like Seagate Technology PLC and Xerox Corp, and pharma play Gilead Sciences Inc. The result is an average price-earnings ratio of around 13, well below the S&P 500\u2019s collective P/E which is now over 25.  Those beaten-up names might make investors a little queasy, especially since this ETF is so concentrated with just 20 stocks. But you cannot argue with the performance: It boasts one-year returns of 23.1 percent, matching the S&P 500, to add to 2016\u2019s 24.8 percent.  Other value ETFs have been picking up bargains, while the rest of the universe obsesses over growth. Another standout is Guggenheim Investments\u2019 S&P Pure Value ETF. It sifts through the S&P 500, eliminates all growth stocks and the so-called \u201cmuddle in the middle,\u201d and comes up with 114 pure value plays.  Among its top holdings is telecom provider CenturyLink Inc, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, agriculture play Archer Daniels Midland Co and General Motors Co.  The one-year performance is 17.2 percent, with five-year gains at 16 percent annually - not bad for a supposedly out-of-favor strategy. \u201cSince we\u2019ve been in a market where growth has outperformed, many investors are now looking at value\u2019s relative appeal,\u201d said William Belden, Guggenheim\u2019s director of ETF development. \u201cAnd over time, a value tilt tends to outperform its growth peers.\u201d  The $890-million fund also boasts an affordable expense ratio of .35 percent. In the fund\u2019s rebalancing in December financial and utilities were trimmed back, thanks to their recent runups, while consumer discretionary stocks were boosted.  A word of caution for value-minded investors: Such deep-value and pure-value screens tend to make holdings more limited, and therefore more volatile, than broader market indices.  Investors wary of concentrated bets should perhaps look to a larger, steadier ship like Vanguard\u2019s Value Index Fund. This fund, five-star-rated by Chicago-based research shop Morningstar, contains 329 total stocks and annualized returns of 15.2 percent over five years.  Its biggest holdings are familiar blue-chippers like Microsoft Corp, Johnson & Johnson, JP Morgan Chase & Co and Exxon Mobil Corp. Perhaps best of all for value-conscious investors, its expense ratio is a microscopic 0.06 percent.  Part of the appeal of value ETFs is that when the next downturn comes, high-flying growth stocks will likely get pounded more than reliable blue chips.

          "body": "CARACAS, Jan 3 (Reuters) - A U.S. court has dismissed Canadian gold miner Crystallex\u2019s lawsuit against asset transfers by Venezuelan-owned refiner Citgo as part of a long-running dispute over the South American nation\u2019s 2008 nationalization of the company\u2019s assets.  Crystallex International Corp is seeking to collect $1.2 billion plus interest awarded in 2016 by a World Bank tribunal against Venezuela, which Venezuela has refused to pay.  The company has argued that Citgo financial operations in 2015 and 2016, including bond issues and dividend payments, were \u201cfraudulent transfers\u201d meant to prevent Crystallex from collecting the award.  The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals accepted the defendant\u2019s request to dismiss the suit because Crystallex\u2019s claim is against Venezuela rather than Citgo, which is owned by Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.  \u201cWhile we do not condone the debtor\u2019s and the transferor\u2019s actions, we must conclude that Crystallex has failed to state a claim,\u201d the court said in a ruling on Wednesday.  A lawyer representing Crystallex declined to comment. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Crystallex\u2019s lawsuit had targeted a Delaware-incorporated subsidiary of PDVSA which in turn owns Citgo. It called the transfers a violation of the Delaware Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act.  The case has been closely followed by investors holding Venezuela\u2019s distressed bonds. Some have considered targeting Citgo in the event that President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government, struggling under hyperinflation and an economic crisis, defaults on its debt.  Sovereign nations and state-owned companies are generally considered separate legal entities, meaning companies that have commercial disputes with the former face an uphill battle in seeking to collect from the latter.  Crystallex has argued that PDVSA is in fact the \u201calter ego\u201d of Venezuela.  Venezuela, which has around $30 billion in outstanding bonds, has little in the way of offshore assets.  That has encouraged creditors to consider ways to pursue Citgo under a potential default scenario.  \u201cThis decision is a big blow for Crystallex\u2019s fraudulent transfer theory but doesn\u2019t undermine the legal basis for its alter ego theory,\u201d said Mark Weidemaier, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is an expert on international debt disputes and resolution.  Maduro said in November his government would restructure foreign debt, but Caracas has continued to make payments - with significant delays - on both PDVSA and Venezuela bonds.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), whose leadership includes critics of President Donald Trump, asked a federal judge to declare that the Justice Department was violating the Freedom of Information Act by not expediting the group\u2019s request.  The Justice Department on Dec. 12 invited a small group of journalists to examine private text messages exchanged during the 2016 presidential election campaign by FBI lawyer Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, a senior FBI agent who at one point was working on FBI investigations into possible contacts between Trump\u2019s team and Russia.  In the message traffic, Strzok was quoted as saying Democrat Hillary Clinton \u201cjust has to win\u201d and he and Page expressed concern that a Trump presidency could politicize the FBI.   Trump and his supporters, including members of Congress, have cited the messages between the FBI employees as evidence of alleged bias against Trump by Mueller\u2019s team.  Mueller is investigating whether Trump\u2019s presidential campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the election. Russia has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion.  CREW\u2019s lawsuit said it asked the Justice Department for internal correspondence on how the department decided to release the messages to the media, any correspondence with Congress about such a release and communications with reporters regarding the meeting at which the materials were disclosed.  The Justice Department had no comment.  Trump administration officials say a decision by the Obama Justice Department to release internal communications about an anti-drug operation that went wrong set a precedent for the release of messages exchanged between Strzok and Page.

Stocks held gains following the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s last policy meeting. Details of the meeting showed that policymakers were worried over the fate of currently low inflation and saw the recent tax changes as providing a boost to the economy.  \u201cIt emphasizes the message they\u2019ve had out there, that they\u2019ll be data dependent and that they want to try to normalize policy unless there\u2019s an economic slowdown or inflation doesn\u2019t act as expected,\u201d said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.  \u201cIt was at least interesting that they tipped their hats to the tax cuts.\u201d  Earlier in the session, a report showed U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, in a further sign of strong economic momentum at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy.  The technology sector was boosted by a rise in shares of Alphabet, IBM and chipmakers. The S&P 500 tech index - the best-performing S&P 500 sector in 2017 with a 37-percent jump - was up 1 percent.  U.S. chipmaker stocks surged for second straight session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 1.4 percent and heading for its strongest two-day performance since July.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 48.67 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,872.68, the S&P 500 gained 13.73 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,709.54 and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.86 points, or 0.75 percent, to 7,059.75.  Oracle shares were up 2.5 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock.  Gains in energy and healthcare also boosted the market. The S&P energy index was up 1.5 percent while S&P healthcare was up 1 percent.  Intel fell 6.2 percent following a report that its processor chips had a fundamental design flaw.  Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices climbed 9.5 percent. Nvidia gained 6.6 percent and Micron rose 2.8 percent.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ancient DNA extracted from the skull of a six-week-old baby girl whose 11,500-year-old remains were unearthed in a burial pit in central Alaska is helping scientists resolve long-standing controversies about how humans first populated the Americas.  Scientists said on Wednesday a study of her genome indicated there was just a single wave of migration into the Americas across a land bridge, now submerged, that spanned the Bering Strait and connected Siberia to Alaska during the Ice Age.  The infant \u2014 named \u201csunrise girl-child\u201d (Xach\u2019itee\u2019aanenh T\u2019eede Gaay) using the local indigenous language \u2014 belonged to a previously unknown Native American population that descended from those intrepid migrants, the researchers added.  \u201cThe study provides the first direct genomic evidence that all Native American ancestry can be traced back to the same source population during the last Ice Age,\u201d University of Alaska Fairbanks archaeologist Ben Potter said.  The remains of the infant \u2014 part of a hunter-gatherer culture that hunted bison, elk, hare, squirrels and birds and caught salmon \u2014 were unearthed in 2013 at a prehistoric encampment in Alaska\u2019s Tanana River Valley about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Fairbanks.  Our species first arose in Africa roughly 300,000 years ago, and later spread around the world. The researchers studied the baby\u2019s genome and genetic data covering other populations to unravel how and when the Americas were first populated.  A single ancestral Native American group split from East Asians about 36,000 year ago and thousands of years later crossed the land bridge, they said. This founding group diverged into two lineages about 20,000 years ago.  The first lineage trekked south of the huge ice caps that covered much of North America between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago, spreading throughout North and South America and becoming the ancestors of today\u2019s Native Americans.  The second was the newly identified population called Ancient Beringians who included the infant. They eventually disappeared, perhaps absorbed into another population that later inhabited Alaska.  Some scientists previously hypothesized about multiple migratory waves over the land bridge as recent as 14,000 years ago.  The girl was found alongside remains of an even-younger female infant, possibly a first cousin, whose genome the researchers could not sequence. Both were covered in red ochre and surrounded by decorated antler tools.  \u201cEven the one that got sequenced was a huge challenge due to poor DNA preservation,\u201d said Eske Willerslev, director of the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Centre for GeoGenetics.  The research was published in the journal Nature.  Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler"

          "title": "Bannon calls Trump Jr. meeting with Russians 'treasonous': book",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon called a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians attended by Donald Trump Jr. and his father\u2019s top campaign officials \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic,\u201d according to excerpts of a new book seen by Reuters on Wednesday.  The explosive comments from a former close aide and far-right architect of Donald Trump\u2019s November 2016 election victory roiled the White House and the Republican president, who famously values loyalty in associates and employees. Trump fired Bannon from his White House post in August and split with him on Wednesday in a highly personal public repudiation.  \u201cSteve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,\u201d Trump said in a statement hours after Bannon\u2019s comments emerged.  In the book, Bannon expressed derision and astonishment over the meeting at Trump Tower in New York in which a Russian lawyer was said to be offering damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to the book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff.  Bannon also was quoted as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians who took part in the meeting to meet his father in Trump Tower. Trump Jr. arranged the meeting and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman,  Paul Manafort, also attended.  The June 9, 2016, meeting has become part of federal special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election. Trump has denied any such collusion.  \u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers,\u201d Bannon was quoted as saying in excerpts of the book seen by Reuters.  \u201cEven if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.\u201d  Bannon also was quoted as saying, \u201cThe chance that Don Jr. did not walk these jumos up to this father\u2019s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero.\u201d Jumo is a word meaning drunk.  When an intermediary proposed the meeting, saying the Russians were offering damaging information about Clinton, Trump Jr. responded in an email, \u201cI love it.\u201d  Bannon was incredulous about the meeting shortly after it was first revealed publicly, according to the book, concluding sarcastically, \u201cThat\u2019s the brain trust they had.\u201d  The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Trump Jr. on the Bannon comments, first reported by the Guardian.  The book, due out next Tuesday, was based on more than 200 interviews with Trump, senior White House staffers and confidantes conducted by Wolff, a contributing editor for The Hollywood Reporter, according to publisher Henry Holt.  In a New York magazine article on Wednesday adapted from the book, Wolff described a campaign team looking forward to losing, from Trump and his family to staffers angling for profitable jobs after the election.  When it became clear on election night that Trump would win, Donald Trump Jr told a friend that his father \u201clooked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania was in tears - and not of joy.\u201d      U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to try to help Trump win in part by hacking and releasing emails embarrassing to Clinton. Moscow has denied the allegation.  In the book, Bannon also said he believed the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow will focus on money laundering.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV,\u201d Bannon was quoted as saying.  Manafort and business associate Rick Gates, who also worked on Trump\u2019s campaign, pleaded not guilty in November to federal charges brought by Mueller including conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine\u2019s former pro-Russian government.  Bannon was scheduled to appear in the near future before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee and will likely be questioned about the Trump Tower meeting comments, a congressional official said.  Bannon became Trump\u2019s campaign manager in the months before the November 2016 election, but after the Trump Tower meeting. He served as chief White House strategist during the first eight months of Trump\u2019s turbulent presidency.  He was a driving force behind Trump\u2019s nationalist and anti-globalization agenda. After being fired in August, he returned to lead the far-right Breitbart News website.

          "body": "The following are the Federal Reserve\u2019s staff forecasts as contained in the minutes of recent Federal Open Market Committee meetings:  For a full text, see here  DEC 12-13 FOMC: Minutes released on Jan. 3:  \u201cThe U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting was generally comparable with the staff\u2019s previous forecast. Real GDP was forecast to have increased at a solid pace in the second half of 2017. Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was revised up modestly, reflecting the staff\u2019s updated assumption that the reduction in federal income taxes expected to begin next year would be larger than assumed in the previous projection. The staff projected that real GDP would increase at a modestly faster pace than potential output through 2019. The unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue running below the staff\u2019s slightly downward-revised estimate of the longer-run natural rate over this period.  \u201cThe staff\u2019s forecast for total PCE price inflation was revised up a little for 2017, as somewhat higher forecasts for core PCE prices and for consumer energy prices were offset only partially by a lower forecast for consumer food prices. Total PCE price inflation in 2018 was projected to be about the same as in 2017, despite projected declines in consumer energy prices; core PCE prices were forecast to rise faster in 2018, reflecting the expected waning of transitory factors that held down those prices in 2017. Beyond 2018, the inflation forecast was little changed from the previous projection. The staff projected that inflation would be very close to the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective in 2019 and at that objective in 2020.  \u201cThe staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. On the one hand, many indicators of uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook continued to be subdued; on the other hand, considerable uncertainty remained about a number of federal government policies relevant for the economic outlook. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced. Downside risks to inflation included the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may move lower or that the run of soft core inflation readings this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected. These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.  OCT.31-NOV. 1 FOMC: Minutes released on Nov. 22:  \u201cThe U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for this FOMC meeting was broadly similar to the previous forecast. Real GDP was expected to rise at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of this year, boosted in part by a rebound in spending and production after the negative effects of the hurricanes in the third quarter. Payroll employment was also expected to rebound during the fourth quarter. Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was essentially unrevised. In particular, the staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output through 2019. The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff\u2019s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.  \u201cThe staff\u2019s forecast for total PCE price inflation was little changed for 2017, as a somewhat higher forecast for consumer energy prices was mostly offset by a slightly lower forecast for core PCE prices. Although total PCE price inflation was forecast to be about the same in 2017 as it was last year, core PCE price inflation was anticipated to be a little lower than in 2016, and consumer food and energy price inflation was expected to be a little higher. Total PCE price inflation was projected to pick up in 2018, as most of the softness in core PCE price inflation this year was expected to be transitory. How-ever, the staff\u2019s forecasts for core inflation and, thus, for total inflation were revised down slightly for next year, reflecting the judgment that a bit of the unexplained weakness in core inflation this year may carry over into next year. Beyond 2018, the inflation forecast was unchanged from the previous projection. The staff continued to project that inflation would reach the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective in 2019.  \u201cThe staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. On the one hand, many indicators of uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook continued to be subdued; on the other hand, considerable uncertainty remained about a number of federal government policies. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for realGDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced. Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of soft readings on core inflation this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected. These downside risks were seen as essentially counter-balanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its longer-run potential.\u201d  SEPT. 19-20 FOMC: Minutes released on Oct. 11:  \u201cThe U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was broadly similar to the previous forecast. Real GDP was expected to rise at a solid pace, on net, in the second half of the year, and by a little more than previously projected, reflecting data on spending that were stronger than expected on balance. The short-term disruptions to spending and production associated with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma were expected to reduce real GDP growth in the third quarter and to boost it in the fourth quarter as production returned to its pre-hurricane path and as a portion of the lost spending was made up. The hurricanes were also expected to depress payroll employment in September, with a reversal over the next few months. Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was little revised. In particular, the staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output through 2019. The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff\u2019s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. Because of continued subdued inflation readings and, given real GDP growth, a larger-than-expected decline in the unemployment rate over much of the past year, the staff revised down slightly its estimate of the longer-run natural rate of unemployment in this projection.  \u201cThe staff\u2019s forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by the change in the PCE price index, was revised up somewhat for 2017 in response to hurricane-related effects on gasoline prices. The near-term forecast for core PCE price inflation was essentially unrevised. Total PCE price inflation this year was expected to run at the same pace as last year, with a slower increase in core PCE prices offset by a slightly larger increase in energy prices and an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports. Beyond 2017, the inflation forecast was little revised from the previous projection. The staff continued to project that inflation would edge higher in the next couple of years and that it would reach the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective in 2019.  \u201cThe staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. On the one hand, many financial market indicators of uncertainty remained subdued, and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook still appeared to be less than last year; on the other hand, uncertainty about the direction of some economic policies was judged to have remained elevated. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. The risks to the projection for inflation were also seen as balanced. Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected. These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.\u201d  JULY 25-26 FOMC: Minutes released on Aug. 16:  \u201cThe U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was broadly similar to the previous forecast. In particular, real GDP growth, which was modest in the first quarter, was still expected to have stepped up to a solid pace in the second quarter and to maintain roughly the same rate of increase in the second half of the year. In this projection, the staff scaled back its assumptions regarding the magnitude and duration of fiscal policy expansion in the coming years. However, the effect of this change on the projection for real GDP over the next couple of years was largely offset by lower assumed paths for the exchange value of the dollar and for longer-term interest rates. Thus, as in the June projection, the staff projected that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2017 through 2019. The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff\u2019s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.  \u201cThe staff\u2019s forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by the change in the PCE price index, was revised down slightly for 2017 in response to weaker-than-expected incoming data for inflation. As a result, inflation this year was expected to be similar in magnitude to last year, with an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports offset by a slower increase in core PCE prices and weaker energy prices. Beyond 2017, the forecast was little revised from the previous projection, as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory. The staff continued to project that inflation would increase in the next couple of years and that it would be close to the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective in 2018 and at 2 percent in 2019.  \u201cThe staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. On the one hand, many financial market indicators of uncertainty remained subdued, and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook still appeared to be less than late last year; on the other hand, uncertainty about the direction of some economic policies was judged to have remained elevated. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced. Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down, that the dollar could appreciate substantially, or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected. These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.\u201d"

          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico is failing to root out money laundering because it uses a reactive case-by-case investigation approach and law enforcement agencies suffer from corruption, according to a report on Wednesday by an international body that fights illicit cash.  Money laundering \u201cis not investigated and prosecuted in a proactive and systematic fashion.... Consequently, the number of prosecutions and convictions for money laundering are very low. Significant shortcomings were found in the way in which money-laundering cases are investigated,\u201d said the report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  The group is an inter-governmental organization established in 1989.  Mexico\u2019s finance ministry and the attorney general\u2019s office promised in a joint statement to improve efforts. \u201cThe authorities commit to strengthening the areas of opportunity detected, but above all to continue safeguarding the national financial system and supervising vulnerable activities,\u201d they said.  Mexico is making little headway in seizing illicit cash, according to the government\u2019s own estimates.  Mexico seized just $32.5 million in 2016. That represents less than 0.1 percent of the $58.5 billion of illicit revenues the government estimates is generated by organized crime annually.  Although the FATF said Mexican authorities generally have \u201ca good understanding of money laundering and terrorist financing risks ... this financial intelligence does not often lead to investigations of money laundering, underlying crimes, and terrorist financing.\u201d  Mexico is the top source of illegal drugs to the United States and both countries\u2019 authorities have been criticized by civil society groups for leaving drug gang finances largely intact.  \u201cThe level of corruption affecting law enforcement agencies, in particular at the state level, undermines their capacity to investigate and prosecute serious offences,\u201d said the report.  In a draft of the report previously seen by Reuters, FATF commended efforts to clean up the Mexican banking sector after U.S. investigations in the mid-2000s showed global banks processed billions of dollars in drug gang cash.  But it said tax authorities did not do enough to monitor businesses outside the financial sector used for money laundering, such as real estate.

          "title": "Mexico falls short on prosecuting money laundering: report",
          "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico is failing to root out money laundering because it uses a reactive case-by-case investigation approach and law enforcement agencies suffer from corruption, according to a report on Wednesday by an international body that fights illicit cash.  Money laundering \u201cis not investigated and prosecuted in a proactive and systematic fashion.... Consequently, the number of prosecutions and convictions for money laundering are very low. Significant shortcomings were found in the way in which money-laundering cases are investigated,\u201d said the report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  The group is an inter-governmental organization established in 1989.  Mexico\u2019s finance ministry and the attorney general\u2019s office promised in a joint statement to improve efforts. \u201cThe authorities commit to strengthening the areas of opportunity detected, but above all to continue safeguarding the national financial system and supervising vulnerable activities,\u201d they said.  Mexico is making little headway in seizing illicit cash, according to the government\u2019s own estimates.  Mexico seized just $32.5 million in 2016. That represents less than 0.1 percent of the $58.5 billion of illicit revenues the government estimates is generated by organized crime annually.  Although the FATF said Mexican authorities generally have \u201ca good understanding of money laundering and terrorist financing risks ... this financial intelligence does not often lead to investigations of money laundering, underlying crimes, and terrorist financing.\u201d  Mexico is the top source of illegal drugs to the United States and both countries\u2019 authorities have been criticized by civil society groups for leaving drug gang finances largely intact.  \u201cThe level of corruption affecting law enforcement agencies, in particular at the state level, undermines their capacity to investigate and prosecute serious offences,\u201d said the report.  In a draft of the report previously seen by Reuters, FATF commended efforts to clean up the Mexican banking sector after U.S. investigations in the mid-2000s showed global banks processed billions of dollars in drug gang cash.  But it said tax authorities did not do enough to monitor businesses outside the financial sector used for money laundering, such as real estate.

          "body": "DUBLIN, Jan 3 (Reuters) - In the first test case of a major sovereign syndication under sweeping new financial market rules, Ireland\u2019s debt agency said the process went relatively smoothly, soothing concerns that the new regulations could prove disruptive to bond transactions.  Ireland was the first euro zone sovereign issuer out of the traps this year when it raised 4 billion euros in a new 10-year bond on Wednesday, the same day the wide-ranging European Union financial reforms took effect.  The new regime, known as MiFID II or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive I, shines a spotlight on the innards of stock, bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to report detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions.  \u201cI would say there was some small change,\u201d Frank O\u2019Connor, the head of funding at Ireland\u2019s National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), told a conference call.  \u201cUnder MiFID II, sovereigns tend to be more exempt than other market participants. Notwithstanding that, the primary dealers and the people who are involved in the sales process have obligations to the end client.\u201d  O\u2019Connor said the changes were limited to some additional documentation, for example, having to include an extra line in its announcement of the deal on Tuesday stating that its target market for the bonds were eligible counterparties, professional clients and retail clients \u201cas defined in MiFID II\u201d.  The syndicate of banks and brokers mandated by the NTMA to sell the bond were also now obliged to provide the debt agency with an overarching guidance of the allocation in writing which it then had to approve, he said.  The rollout of the new rules has been glitch-free so far, though disruptions cannot be ruled out, the EU\u2019s markets watchdog said.  \u201cIt\u2019s very small to the eyes of some, but that\u2019s a change,\u201d O\u2019Connor said, referring to one of the tweaks. \u201cIn terms of the underlying for us, there was no change, I would say at the margin just a little more documentation.\u201d (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Additional reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan in London; Editing by Richard Balmforth)"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - A trial of a potential new brain cancer treatment has shown that a virus injected directly into the bloodstream can reach tumors deep inside the brain and switch on the body\u2019s own defense system to attack them.  The trial involved just nine patients, but scientists said that if the results could be replicated in larger studies, the naturally occurring \u2018reovirus\u2019 could be developed into an effective immunotherapy for people with aggressive brain tumors.  \u201cThis is the first time it has been shown that a therapeutic virus is able to pass through the brain-blood barrier,\u201d said  Adel Samson, a medical oncologist at the University of Leeds\u2019 Institute of Cancer and Pathology who co-led the work.  He said their trial had shown not only that a virus could be delivered to a tumor deep in the brain, but that when it reached its target, \u201cit stimulated the body\u2019s own immune defenses to attack the cancer\u201d.  Published in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, the trial involved nine patients with tumors that had either spread to the brain from other areas or were fast-growing gliomas, an aggressive type of brain cancer.  All the patients were due to have their tumors removed surgically, but in the days beforehand they were each given a single dose of the reovirus administered via intravenous drip into the bloodstream.  Once the tumors were removed, the scientists analyzed samples to see if the virus had been able to reach the cancer, which in some cases was deep within the brain.   In all nine patients, there was evidence that the virus had reached its target, they said. There were also signs that the replicating virus had stimulated the immune system, with white blood cells or so-called \u201ckiller\u201d T-cells being drawn to the tumor to attack it.  Because the virus only infects cancer cells and leaves healthy cells alone, patients who received the experimental treatment reported only mild side-effects such as slight flu-like symptoms.  Until these positive results, scientists had been doubtful about whether the virus would be able to pass into the brain because of the protective blood-brain barrier membrane.  However, injecting the virus directly into the brain would be difficult and potentially dangerous.  Alan Melcher of Britain\u2019s Institute of Cancer Research, who also co-led the study, said the results pointed a way forward for more trials using this virus, including testing whether it can harness the immune system to super-charge the effect of existing chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments.  \u201cNow we know we can get reovirus across the blood-brain barrier, we have begun clinical studies to see just how effective this viral immunotherapy can be,\u201d he said.

          "title": "Fed policymakers see future rate rises guided by inflation, fiscal stimulus",
          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers showed worry over the fate of currently low inflation and saw recent tax changes as providing a boost to consumer spending, according to the minutes of the U.S. central bank\u2019s last policy meeting on Dec. 12-13 released on Wednesday.  The details of the meeting, at which the Fed raised interest rates for the fifth time since the 2008 financial crisis, also showed that officials have a similar lack of certainty over the impact of fiscal stimulus on raising price pressures.  \u201cMost participants reiterated their support for continuing a gradual approach to raising the target range, noting that this approach helped to balance risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation,\u201d the Fed said in the minutes.  They then mulled the dual possibilities that the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts or easy financial conditions could cause inflation pressures to build unduly, while at the same time also considering that actual or expected inflation may fail to rise to the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target.  The inflation shortfall is set to dominate incoming Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s first few months as chief of the central bank with further rate increases more difficult to justify without an upswing. He is set to take over from Janet Yellen by the time of the next rate-setting meeting on Jan. 31-Feb. 1.  At its December meeting, the Fed kept its forecast for three rate rises this year and in 2019 unchanged even as policymakers anticipated a short-term boost in U.S. economic growth from the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping $1.5 trillion tax overhaul signed into law on Dec. 22.  The tax changes reduce the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily cuts the taxes paid by most individuals as well.  In the minutes, many policymakers \u201cexpected the proposed cuts in personal taxes to provide some boost to consumer spending\u201d and many characterized the changes in business taxes as likely to provide a modest boost to capital spending.  \u201cHowever, some business contacts...noted that the increase in cash flow that would result...was more likely to be used for mergers and acquisitions or for debt reduction and stock buybacks,\u201d the minutes said.  In December, the Fed forecast ultra-low unemployment of below 4 percent in 2018 and 2019, but still predicted inflation would remain below 2 percent at the end of 2018.  The mystery of low inflation in such a robust economy has prompted debate at the Fed for the past several months and was the concern of the two policymakers who voted against a rate increase at last month\u2019s meeting.  The latest minutes showed that while participants generally viewed inflation rising back to target over the medium term, several said \u201cother persistent factors may be holding down inflation.\u201d  Investors have all but ruled out an interest rate increase at the Fed\u2019s upcoming meeting but currently see another nudge upwards at the following one in March.

          "body": "BUENOS AIRES, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Bus, train and subway fares in the Buenos Aires area will rise this year, the Argentine government said on Wednesday, despite fears that the increases will stoke already high inflation.  Fare increases on buses and trains will start in February, Transportation Minister Guillermo Dietrich told reporters, with an initial average rise of around 35 percent.  \u201cIn order to continue funding public works, we will update rates in a gradual, step-by-step manner,\u201d Dietrich said at a news conference. Subway rates are set to start rising in April.  The news came a week after Argentina changed its 2018 inflation target to 15 percent from the central bank\u2019s previous goal of 8-12 percent. Consumer prices rose 21 percent in the first 11 months of 2017, one of the world\u2019s fastest rates.  President Mauricio Macri was elected in 2015 on promises of freeing the economy from the tight controls favored by his predecessor. He reduced energy and transportation subsidies in a bid to simultaneously cut the fiscal deficit, lower inflation, attract investment and induce long-term economic growth.  Although higher transport fares in Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s most densely populated area, would put upward pressure on consumer prices, Goldman Sachs analyst Alberto Ramos said the fare increase would be positive in the long term.  \u201cIt will impact inflation in the short term but will keep it lower and contained in the future as prices and tariffs that reflect the cost of producing and supplying these services will attract more investment and will lead to better and cheaper services in the future,\u201d he said in an email.  \u201cIt is better to have real prices than hidden subsidies paid by society and non-users of those services,\u201d Ramos added.  The government aims to reduce its primary fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2018, down from 4.2 percent.  The inflation target revision was \u201ca long overdue recognition that the aggressive inflation targets were not compatible with a slow pace of fiscal adjustment,\u201d Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Nomura Securities International, said in a research note on Wednesday.

          "body": "* Stock markets globally start 2018 on cheerful note  * S&P cruises past 2,700 as tech stocks advance  * Dollar up after strong U.S. data, ahead of Fed minutes (Updates to European markets close; adds commentary)  By Stephanie Kelly  NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - World shares smashed records on Wednesday as U.S. equities advanced and European stocks closed higher on investor optimism in the new year, while the dollar rallied against key currencies ahead of minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.40 percent. In 2017, the index\u2019s best year since 2009, it set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value.  U.S. equities also climbed to fresh highs on Wednesday, propelled by tech stocks. The benchmark S&P 500 breached the 2,700-mark for the first time, while the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also broke records.  Technology companies Oracle and IBM rose 2.47 percent and 2.92 percent, respectively, following brokerage upgrades. The shares helped boost the S&P technology index 0.86 percent.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 45.72 points, or 0.18 percent, to 24,869.73, the S&P 500 gained 12.81 points, or 0.48 percent, to 2,708.62 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.74 points, or 0.68 percent, to 7,054.64.  Tuesday, the first day of trading in 2018, saw a strong start for the indices, with the S&P and the Nasdaq hitting record closing highs.  \u201cWe had a strong start and we are likely to see a follow through in the near-term,\u201d said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.  In Europe, shares closed higher after a rising dollar boosted exporters and Wall Street records lifted optimism as new European MiFID II market rules took hold. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.48 percent.  Meanwhile, MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.46 percent higher as manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy.  Emerging market stocks rose 0.58 percent, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 0.08 percent.  The dollar index rose 0.24 percent, snapping a three-week losing streak, after stronger-than-forecast U.S. manufacturing and construction data.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.04 percent versus the greenback at 112.35 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3518, down 0.50 percent on the day.  The euro was down 0.27 percent to $1.2025.  Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.4471 percent, from 2.465 percent late on Tuesday.  The 30-year bond last rose 11/32 in price to yield 2.7933 percent, from 2.81 percent late on Tuesday.  Investors are also awaiting the release later on Wednesday of minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. During the meeting, Fed policy makers decided to raise short-term interest rates for a third time in 2017.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of focus around the discussion around what the potential impact of the tax bill was,\u201d said Bill Northey, a senior vice president at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana.  \u201cCertainly there had to be some discussion around the economic impacts. I think that\u2019s going to be one of the clear pieces of information value that we can draw from these minutes.\u201d  Hawkish comments from two European Central Bank officials sent yields higher on Tuesday, with the 10-year German Bund yield hitting a two-month peak and the five-year U.S. yield reaching its highest level since April 2011.  Elsewhere, spot gold reached its highest since mid-September on Wednesday, before edging back to $1,316.11 per ounce.  Oil prices hit fresh two-and-a-half year highs as strong output in the United States and Russia balanced tensions from a sixth day of unrest in OPEC member Iran.  U.S. crude rose 2.02 percent to $61.59 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.77, up 1.8 percent on the day.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Botox-maker Allergan Plc (AGN.N) on Wednesday said it plans to cut over 1,000 jobs, more than 5 percent of its workforce, and eliminate an additional 400 currently open positions, as it works to cut costs in the face of new competition for its second most important drug, dry-eye treatment Restasis.   The company said the jobs and positions it plans to eliminate mostly focus on products and categories where the company has or expects to soon lose exclusivity.  The drugmaker said it expects to take a $125 million charge from the job cuts, primarily due to severance, most of which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.   Analysts estimated that the company had around $5.8 billion of net income in 2017 on roughly $15.9 billion of revenue, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  It said cost savings from this restructuring program  should be around $300 million to $400 million per year. Allergan currently employs 18,000 people, according to its website. RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky said the savings should add around 75 cents to $1 of earnings per share support going forward.  In November, the company said it was working on a program to expand its base business and reduce costs so it could return to earnings growth by 2019, but did not disclose a specific strategy at that point.  Allergan worked hard in recent years to protect Restasis, which generated about $1.5 billion in sales in 2016, from generic rivals. It struck a controversial deal with a Native American tribe in September to shield review of the patents by U.S. regulators, drawing the ire of lawmakers and rival drug companies.  But in October, a Texas federal judge invalidated Restasis patents on grounds that they cover ideas that are obvious, making it possible for rival generics to hit the market as early as next year.

          "title": "Trump blasts former aide Bannon after 'treasonous' comments",
          "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday blasted former White House adviser Steve Bannon as having \u201clost his mind\u201d in the fallout over damaging comments Bannon made about Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., in excerpts of a new book.  Trump, who had continued to speak privately with Bannon in the months after firing him as the White House chief strategist last August, essentially cut ties with Bannon in a blistering statement issued after Bannon\u2019s comments about Don Jr. came to light.  \u201cSteve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,\u201d Trump said.  Trump said Bannon had little to do with his presidential victory in 2016 but was to blame for the loss of a Republican-held U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in December when accused child molester Roy Moore, who both Bannon and Trump had backed, lost to Democrat Doug Jones.  \u201cNow that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn\u2019t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,\u201d Trump said.  \u201cSteve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well,\u201d Trump added.  Bannon expressed derision and astonishment over the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in New York in which a Russian lawyer was said to be offering damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to the book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff.  In the book, Bannon called the meeting that his son arranged and that Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also attended \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d Bannon also was quoted as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians who took part in the meeting to meet his father in Trump Tower.  The explosive comments from a former close aide and far-right architect of Trump\u2019s November 2016 election victory roiled the White House and the Republican president, who famously values loyalty in associates and employees.  \u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers,\u201d Bannon said in the book in excerpts seen by Reuters.  \u201cEven if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.\u201d  When an intermediary proposed the meeting, saying the Russians were offering damaging information about Clinton, Trump Jr. responded in an email, \u201cI love it.\u201d  Bannon was incredulous about the meeting shortly after it was revealed, according to the book, concluding sarcastically, \u201cThat\u2019s the brain trust they had.\u201d  Reporting by Steve Holland and Doina Chiacu; Additional\nreporting by Jim Oliphant; Editing by Will Dunham"

          "title": "Senate swears in Democrats from Alabama, Minnesota",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats boosted their ranks in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, trimming Republicans\u2019 edge in the chamber to 51-49 with the swearing in of two new lawmakers from Alabama and Minnesota.  In a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol, officials administered the oath of office to Doug Jones, who won last month\u2019s special election in Alabama to become the state\u2019s first Democratic senator in 25 years, and Tina Smith, who is replacing fellow Democrat Al Franken a day after he resigned over sexual harassment allegations.  Vice President Mike Pence conducted the swearing-in ceremony for both Democrats simultaneously. Jones was escorted to the Senate chamber by former Vice President Joe Biden, while former Vice President Walter Mondale, who is also a former senator from Minnesota, accompanied Smith.  In taking his seat, Jones, 63, a former federal prosecutor who won a bitterly fought special election last month against Republican Roy Moore, reduced the Republican majority in the Senate to 51-49.  Moore, a Christian conservative and former judge, had his campaign hobbled by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls while he was in his 30s. The seat was formerly held by Republican Jeff Sessions, now President Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general.   Jones\u2019 victory left Trump\u2019s Republicans even less room for defections from within their party as they pursue legislative initiatives such as an infrastructure plan, entitlement changes and scaling back Obama-era regulations on industry.  Smith, 59, brings the number of women in the Senate to a record-high 22. Smith, who served as her state\u2019s lieutenant governor, was appointed by Minnesota\u2019s governor to replace Franken.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was seen speaking with Jones just after the swearing-in, welcomed the newcomers in a brief floor speech, and said he hoped the chamber could address issues in a renewed spirit of bipartisanship.  McConnell then plunged immediately into a Republican talking point. He said lawmakers should \u201cset aside the arbitrary notion\u201d that new defense spending should be matched equally by new non-defense spending - a key Democratic request in negotiations set to resume between the parties later Wednesday on a government spending bill.  Congress must reach an agreement by Jan. 19, or face a government shutdown.  A Democratic takeover of the Senate in November\u2019s elections could partially stifle the Trump administration\u2019s agenda but the party\u2019s chances are uncertain. One-third of the seats in the chamber will be up for grabs and Democrats will be defending many more seats than Republicans in this round.  Republicans in 2017 used their thin Senate majority to help a pass a tax overhaul with their colleagues in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. But they fell short in their effort to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare program, after three Senate Republicans rejected the bill.  Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said on Tuesday he would not seek re-election in November, following fellow Republicans Bob Corker and Jeff Flake who announced last year they would retire. Hatch\u2019s move opens the door to a potential run by Mitt Romney, the Republican\u2019s unsuccessful 2012 presidential nominee and one of the party\u2019s top critics of Trump.

          "body": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Shares in Howard Hughes Corp (HHC.N) dropped more than 3 percent on Wednesday after billionaire investor William Ackman, who chairs the real estate company\u2019s board and called it an attractive buy in May, said his firm would sell 2.5 million shares.  Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management is Howard Hughes\u2019 biggest shareholder, is trimming the firm\u2019s holdings for tax reasons and insists he hasn\u2019t soured on one of his hedge fund\u2019s longest-held investments. He needs to make the move in order to invest some $300 million of his own money into Pershing Square Holdings (PSH.AS), his publicly listed portfolio that trades like a closed-end fund.    But investors\u2019 reaction to the news that he is slimming down his Howard Hughes stake illustrates just how much sway the activist investor has in the stock market even after three straight years of losses at his $9.3 billion firm.  In afternoon trading Howard Hughes Corp\u2019s stock stood at $128.52, off 3.25 percent. The company, whose real estate assets include master planned communities like Summerlin near Las Vegas and The Woodlands near Houston, helped performance at Ackman\u2019s firm in the first three quarters of 2017, the fund manager told clients.  He announced the move \u2014 Pershing Square Capital Management will still own a 17.6 percent economic stake, down from 23.4 percent \u2014 as he tries to fix his lagging portfolio, Pershing Square Holdings. After months of buying back more than $40 million worth of Pershing Square Holdings shares, the shares were still trading roughly 20 percent below their net asset value, marking another disappointment for Ackman.  Sluggish returns \u2014 the Pershing Square Holdings portfolio lost 4 percent in 2017 while Pershing Square International lost roughly 1.5 percent - coupled with investor defections and concerns that Ackman\u2019s investment ideas aren\u2019t as powerful as they once were, are prompting new moves, including the planned $300 million cash infusion from Ackman and senior associates.  While the move hurt Howard Hughes\u2019 stock, it helped Pershing Square Holdings. Its Amsterdam-listed shares rose 3.6 percent.  The cash infusion from Ackman, whose net worth is estimated at $1.4 billion by Forbes, is aimed to \u201cassist in reducing the discount to net asset value at which PSH\u2019s public shares currently trade,\u201d the release said.  In May 2017, when Ackman tried to convince other investors to bet on Howard Hughes, he said the company wasn\u2019t well known and its stock price was inexpensive.

          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Last January, Alibaba founder Jack Ma met with Donald Trump, then the U.S. president-elect, to discuss helping one million small U.S businesses access Chinese consumers through the e-commerce giant\u2019s online platform.  Trump told reporters that he and Ma had a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d and would do great things together.  One year on, however, U.S. security concerns have torpedoed Ma\u2019s plans for a $1.2 billion takeover of the Dallas-based MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) by Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL], an Alibaba (BABA.N) affiliate.   It was the most high-profile Chinese deal yet to fall foul of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) under the Trump administration.  The failure has prompted the question among dealmakers: If a Jack Ma-linked company cannot buy a U.S. company, is there hope for other Chinese companies - or should they turn their sights elsewhere?  \u201cThe regulatory uncertainty will certainly make Chinese buyers further head for other countries such as Germany, the UK and Israel for foreign assets,\u201d said one China-focused M&A lawyer at a global law firm, who did not wish to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media.  Over the past decade, a quarter of all Chinese bids for U.S. companies by value have been withdrawn, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with 15 percent for Asia-Pacific-focused deals and 8 percent in Europe.   Not all of the withdrawals were due to regulatory factors.   The largest was the dropping by the Chinese insurer Anbang of a surprise $15 billion bid for Starwood Hotels in 2016.   But U.S. lawmakers - whose biggest rebuff to China was delivered in 2005, when congressional opposition derailed a $19.5 billion bid for Unocal by the Chinese state-owned oil major CNOOC - have once more become an increasing concern for dealmakers.   A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives introduced bills in November to  broaden the government\u2019s power to stop foreign purchases of U.S. companies by strengthening CFIUS, amid growing concerns about Chinese efforts to buy U.S. high-tech companies.  Lawmakers are expected to present a new draft of the bills in March or April and \u201cpeople are pretty confident\u201d that some form of the bills will be passed, according to a China-based lawyer familiar with CFIUS matters.  Rod Hunter, a partner with the Baker McKenzie law firm and a former official with oversight of CFIUS cases under the last Bush administration, said companies needed to take account of the evolving nature of security concerns and the increasing focus on personal data and emerging technologies.   \u201cCFIUS, by statute, focuses only on national security when reviewing proposed foreign investments, but notions of national security have evolved substantially in recent years,\u201d he said.  He added: \u201cFrom the U.S. government perspective, Chinese investment in the United States is made sensitive by the extensive involvement of the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese government in the economy.\u201d  Ant and MoneyGram terminated their deal after CFIUS rejected their proposals to address data safety concerns, according to sources familiar with the confidential discussions.   The United States has typically attracted relatively little Chinese dealmaking due to a mix of regulatory factors and the fierce competition that foreign buyers face from local players.   Just 18 percent of Chinese cross-border deals by value over the past decade have had a U.S. target, compared with 36 percent for Europe and 46 percent for Asia-Pacific.  While China dealmakers acknowledged the signal sent by Ant\u2019s MoneyGram failure, most viewed it as a one-off situation.  \u201cLots of China\u2019s companies underestimate compliance risk and the complexity of operating in highly regulated U.S. markets, particularly in the finance and fin tech sectors,\u201d said Jeffrey Sun, partner at law firm Orrick, based in Shanghai.  Chinese groups have already begun adapting to the difficulty in getting deals passed. In November, the buyout firm Orient Hontai Capital dropped a $1.4 billion bid for AppLovin, a U.S. mobile marketing group, because of push back from CFIUS. Instead of equity, it opted to lend the group $841 million.  Still-pending deals include the $2.7 billion bid by Oceanwide Holdings (000046.SZ) for the insurer Genworth Financial Inc (GNW.N), first announced in October 2016. In November last year the pair agreed to extend the deadline for a second time to April 2018 to allow them to amend the deal terms further to satisfy CFIUS.  Another high-profile deal before CFIUS is the purchase by HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL] of SkyBridge Capital LLC, a hedge fund of funds firm, from Anthony Scaramucci, the Trump administration\u2019s former communications director.  Others have begun to focus on smaller minority investments - a route taken by Tencent (0700.HK), Alibaba\u2019s fiercest Chinese rival. The Shenzhen-based group last year bought a 5 percent stake in the U.S. electric car maker Tesla (TSLA.O) for $1.8 billion.

          "title": "Howard Hughes shares hurt as Ackman trims stake to invest in own fund",
          "body": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Shares in Howard Hughes Corp (HHC.N) dropped more than 3 percent on Wednesday after billionaire investor William Ackman, who chairs the real estate company\u2019s board and called it an attractive buy in May, said his firm would sell 2.5 million shares.  Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management is Howard Hughes\u2019 biggest shareholder, is trimming the firm\u2019s holdings for tax reasons and insists he hasn\u2019t soured on one of his hedge fund\u2019s longest-held investments. He needs to make the move in order to invest some $300 million of his own money into Pershing Square Holdings (PSH.AS), his publicly listed portfolio that trades like a closed-end fund.    But investors\u2019 reaction to the news that he is slimming down his Howard Hughes stake illustrates just how much sway the activist investor has in the stock market even after three straight years of losses at his $9.3 billion firm.  In afternoon trading Howard Hughes Corp\u2019s stock stood at $128.52, off 3.25 percent. The company, whose real estate assets include master planned communities like Summerlin near Las Vegas and The Woodlands near Houston, helped performance at Ackman\u2019s firm in the first three quarters of 2017, the fund manager told clients.  He announced the move \u2014 Pershing Square Capital Management will still own a 17.6 percent economic stake, down from 23.4 percent \u2014 as he tries to fix his lagging portfolio, Pershing Square Holdings. After months of buying back more than $40 million worth of Pershing Square Holdings shares, the shares were still trading roughly 20 percent below their net asset value, marking another disappointment for Ackman.  Sluggish returns \u2014 the Pershing Square Holdings portfolio lost 4 percent in 2017 while Pershing Square International lost roughly 1.5 percent - coupled with investor defections and concerns that Ackman\u2019s investment ideas aren\u2019t as powerful as they once were, are prompting new moves, including the planned $300 million cash infusion from Ackman and senior associates.  While the move hurt Howard Hughes\u2019 stock, it helped Pershing Square Holdings. Its Amsterdam-listed shares rose 3.6 percent.  The cash infusion from Ackman, whose net worth is estimated at $1.4 billion by Forbes, is aimed to \u201cassist in reducing the discount to net asset value at which PSH\u2019s public shares currently trade,\u201d the release said.  In May 2017, when Ackman tried to convince other investors to bet on Howard Hughes, he said the company wasn\u2019t well known and its stock price was inexpensive.

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - After more than 140 years of being stabbed to death on stage, the gypsy heroine of the opera \u201cCarmen\u201d gets her own revenge in a new Italian production - shooting her thwarted lover instead.  The globally popular opera by French composer Georges Bizet, that held its premiere in 1875, will have a new ending when it opens on Jan. 7 in Florence to highlight the ongoing battle to stop violence against women in Italy.  In the latest version, written by Italian director Leo Muscato, the flirtatious, fiery Carmen no longer dies at the hand of her rejected lover Don Jose whom she has abandoned for a bullfighter but pulls a gun on him.  The head of Florence\u2019s Teatro del Maggio Musicale Foundation, Cristiano Chiarot, said he discussed changing the opera with Muscato to give it a more modern ending.  \u201cAt a time when our society is having to confront the murder of women, how can we dare to applaud the killing of a woman?\u201d Chiarot, who took up the role last year, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email.  Italian National Institute of Statistics figures show one in three Italian women aged 16-70 experienced physical or sexual violence in 2014 while 149 women were murdered in 2016, half of whom were killed by partners or ex-partners.  The United Nations in 2012 said violence against women remained a \u201csignificant problem in Italy\u201d and called domestic abuse \u201cthe most pervasive form of violence in Italy\u201d.  The government has since adopted tougher laws to crackdown on violence against women but violence against women remains pervasive amid a culture of patriarchy, Chiarot said.  \u201c(Our opera) is an attempt to highlight the modern-day abuse and mistreatment of women in Italy where femicide is not an uncommon occurrence,\u201d Chiarot added.  Paolo Antonio Klun, a spokesman from the Maggio, said the new \u201cCarmen\u201d was taking a stand when there is so much violence against women as theater had a social role to fulfill.  \u201cThe theater must have an ethical and social function. It must transmit a message against violence,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation     Editing by Belinda Goldsmith @BeeGoldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.

          "title": "Sempra shares bounce on fundraising plans",
          "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 3 (IFR) - Sempra Energy shares rose more than 2% on Wednesday after the natural gas utility revealed plans to raise up to US$4.6bn to fund its acquisition of Texas power distributor Oncor.  California-based Sempra\u2019s stock was up as much as 2.6% to US$108.05 per share on news of the dual-tranche equity and equity-linked offering to fund the pending US$9.45bn purchase.  Sempra said it would sell US$2.5bn of common equity and US$1.5bn of three\u2013year mandatory convertible preferred shares, raising US$4.6bn in all if 15% overallotment options are used.  The mandatory is being marketed with a 6%-6.5% dividend and a 17.5%-22.5% conversion premium.  The smaller-than-expected offering helped relieve pressure on Sempra\u2019s stock price, which slumped last month when fellow California utility PG&E suspended its share dividends.  PG&E\u2019s move, amid uncertainty about the costs associated with the state\u2019s rash of forest fires, pushed Sempra shares as low as US$105.03 last month from US$122.98 in mid-November.  Morgan Stanley, RBC Capital Markets and Barclays are leading Sempra\u2019s offerings, which are scheduled to price after the market close on Thursday.  A strong market backdrop early in the new year and the smaller-than-expected deal size contributed to the positive market reaction, a banker close to the deal said.  Both offerings were well oversubscribed as of Wednesday morning, the banker said.  Sempra agreed to buy Oncor in August after a long-winded sales process for the key remaining assets of bankrupt utility Energy Future Holdings, formerly known as TXU.  In October, Sempra revised the financing plan for Oncor, stating it would fund 65% of the cost with its own equity.  That implied a US$6.1bn equity raise, or more than the US$4.6bn now being sought.  Sempra said in an SEC filing Tuesday that it could use cash on hand, the proceeds of asset sales and future stock sales to make up the difference of about US$1.5bn.  The banker said one option was for Sempra to undertake an at-the-market stock sales at a later date.  California, where Sempra owns the San Diego Gas & Electric Company and the Southern California Gas Company, is one of the few US states where so-called \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d can leave utilities responsible for property damage from wildfires.  Oncor will diversify Sempra\u2019s business away from California and enhance its growth prospects, though it is only modestly accretive to earnings in the first four years.  Sempra last month said it had the support of key stakeholders as part of the regulatory approval process, though it is awaiting final approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas.  While that is expected in the first half of 2018, Sempra has structured the equity sale as a forward sale agreement that delays the issuance of new shares until as late as December 2019, giving it the ability to defer dilution if the regulatory approval process takes longer than expected.  Mandatory convertible is standard for large M&A financings, and allows Sempra to access a different type of investor (convert specialists) and ease the capital call on the market.  The maturity of a number of other mandatory convertible securities in the next three months - and a need to replace those securities - is driving demand for the Sempra offering, the banker said.

          "body": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon lifted a years-old security cordon near its parliament on Wednesday in a move it hopes will revive central Beirut\u2019s business district and cement improved political stability after a prolonged period of upheaval.  Security forces removed metal barriers and heavy concrete slabs which had blocked all entrances to Beirut\u2019s showpiece Place d\u2019Etoile quarter and forced most shops and restaurants in the once thriving district to shut down.  The security measures had been in place around the square for a number of years, but were significantly tightened in 2015 following large-scale protests over a garbage crisis.   Crowds thronged the Place d\u2019Etoile square for the first time in a decade on Sunday night to usher in the new year with fireworks, music and dancing in the streets.  The speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri, who issued Wednesday\u2019s order, said he hoped businesses, restaurants, hotels and offices in the area would now be able to resume work.  \u201cThere were many times we thought about closing, but we said \u2018no, maybe things will pick up\u2019,\u201d said Zeina Hasbini, who runs a chocolate boutique just off the square.  She and her son, who runs a small grocery store next door, said they were sure lifting the barriers would boost business as footfall and investment increased.  Though Lebanon still faces daunting challenges, it has seen some progress over the past year despite continued conflict in neighboring Syria and rising tensions elsewhere in the region.  Its squabbling politicians clinched a deal that ended a two-and-a-half-year period without a state president and installed a new government under Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. The government also approved its first budget in 12 years and awarded its first offshore oil land gas exploration licenses.  In August, Islamic State and other militants were cleared from the Lebanon-Syria border area after separate offensives by the Lebanese army and Lebanon\u2019s powerful Hezbollah militia.   The Petit Cafe overlooking Place d\u2019Etoile reopened in mid-2017 after shutting its doors as the Syrian crisis erupted.  \u201cThe country ground to a halt: you no longer saw tourists, or people from the Gulf countries, so we closed for about 6-7 years,\u201d said Muhammad Faris, the restaurant manager.   He said the new year\u2019s celebrations and the lifting of the barriers were signs that the area \u201ccan flourish again\u201d.  Despite such signs of hope, Lebanon remains a politically fraught country.  Tensions flared in November when Hariri unexpectedly resigned as prime minister in a shock broadcast from Saudi Arabia \u2014 a move linked to conflict in the wider region between Riyadh and Tehran. He subsequently withdrew the resignation and the government resumed business as usual.  Reporting by Lisa Barrington; Editing by Gareth Jones"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Bitcoin was the star of the white-knuckle ride that cryptocurrencies offered in 2017 but lesser-known names, such as Ripple and Ethereum, are seen gaining prominence in 2018.  While bitcoin jumped more than 1,200 percent last year, Ripple, created by the founder of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, surged 35,000 percent in the same period.  That means $100 invested in Ripple in January 2017 would have grown to about $35,000 at the start of this year.  To be sure, bitcoin is still the biggest cryptocurrency by far - with market value exceeding $250 billion - and is expected to keep that mantle in the months to come.  Here is a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies - including bitcoin - and how they performed in 2017:  Ripple (XRP):  Launched in 2012, Ripple had a market cap of $91.79 billion as of Tuesday, second after Bitcoin. It is used by companies such as UBS and Santander as payment technology. In November 2017, American Express Co also launched an instant blockchain-based payment system using Ripple.  Percentage gain in 2017: About 35,000 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: $2.73  Launched in 2015, NEM is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency platform. It is used in a commercial blockchain called Mijin, tested mainly in Japan, by financial institutions and private companies.  Percentage gain in 2017: About 29,000 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: $1.27  Stellar (XLM):  Released in early 2014, Stellar comes in at number three in terms of percentage growth in 2017. In October 2017, Stellar and IBM entered into a deal aimed at improving the speed of global payments.  Percentage gain in 2017: Close to 14,000 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: About $0.76  Dash (DASH):  Originally launched as XCoin in early 2014, Dash got its name in March 2015. It offers instant transactions. Transactions done with Dash get confirmed in seconds, whereas Bitcoin transaction can take up to 10 minutes to confirm.  Percentage gain in 2017: About 9,300 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: $1,162.84  Ethereum (ETH):  Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s main aim is to operate \u2018smart contacts\u2019, instead of acting as a form of money. Smart contracts are scripts of code that can be deployed in Ethereum blockchain.  Percentage gain in 2017: About 9,200 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: $879.91  Litecoin (LTC):  Introduced in October 2011, Litecoin is very similar to bitcoin. It is number six in terms of market cap, according to coinmarketcap.  Percentage gain in 2017: About 4,800 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: $250.31  Cardano (ADA):  Cardano was founded in 2014 and began trading on Bittrex exchange in October 2017. Within three months, it has garnered a market cap of over $18.6 billion, to secure itself at the fifth position (in terms of market cap).  Percentage gain in 2017: Close to 3,000 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: About $0.99  Bitcoin (BTC):  Invented by an unknown person/group called Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was released in January 2009. Bitcoins are created by mining and was the first decentralised cryptocurency.  Percentage gain in 2017: Over 1,200 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: $15,003.90  Bitcoin Cash (BCH):   Born from bitcoin itself, Bitcoin Cash is a segregated version of bitcoin that was released on Aug. 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash was branched out to increase the blocksize limit to 8 MB and allow faster transactions.  Percentage gain in 2017: Over 500 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: $2,748.33  IOTA was introduced in June 2016 and started trading on Bitfinex in June 2017. With a market cap of about $11.19 billion, it is ranked ninth, according to coinmarketcap.  Percentage gain in 2017: Over 450 percent  Trading price as of Wednesday: $4.03  (Graphic - Cryptomania: reut.rs/2CLOAJk)  (Information compiled from Thomson Reuters data, company websites, Coinmarketcap.com)  Compiled by Pallavi Dewan in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty"

Oliver Krauss, a lawyer at Munich-based firm Tricon, said Deutsche Bank should have paid his 31 clients, former Postbank shareholders, around 64 euros per share rather than the 25 euros they received when they accepted the takeover offer in 2010.  They argue, in a suit filed in late December in a district court in Cologne, that Deutsche Bank effectively took control of Postbank in 2008 when it bought a stake of just under 30 percent at a much higher price than 25 euros. They say as a result Postbank shareholders are entitled to a much higher price for their holdings.  A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said the complaint was unfounded, as were other similar suits that are currently making their way through the courts.  A spokeswoman for the court declined to comment.  German weekly WirtschaftsWoche first reported the lawsuit.   Krauss, citing client confidentiality, declined to provide a copy of the lawsuit but confirmed the accuracy of the WirtschaftWoche article.  WirtschaftsWoche said the lawsuit detailed examples of Postbank and Deutsche Bank acting in concert in 2008, including a strategy change to focus on retail customers and dropping riskier forms of business.  In addition, WirtschaftsWoche said Postbank and Deutsche Bank agreed on details of a planned capital increase, board changes and the elimination of a 2008 dividend.  December 31 marked a deadline for taking legal action on the takeover.  Reporting by Hans Seidenstuecker; Writing by Tom Sims. Editing by Jane Merriman"

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s largest parties expressed optimism about the chances of forming a government after several hours of talks between the leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) she hopes to win as coalition partners.  Wednesday\u2019s joint statement from the parties, which talked of growing confidence, was good news for Merkel, whose reputation as Europe\u2019s consummate consensus-builder is on the line in this second bid to form a coalition government after weeks of sniping between its would-be partners.  Seeking a fourth term in office, Merkel saw her authority weakened in a national election in September, when support for her conservatives was eroded by the far right.  \u201cConfidence has grown and we are optimistic heading into the talks,\u201d read the joint statement, issued after three hours of talks between Merkel and other leaders of her Christian Democrats (CDU), her Bavarian CSU allies and the SPD.  She is under pressure to reach a deal with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), which also lost ground in the election, but the two sides have bickered over a range of issues, notably immigration and taxation.  SPD leader Martin Schulz praised the \u201cconcentrated, focused consultations\u201d he had had with leaders, which he said were a good basis for formal exploratory talks. The discussions are due to start on Sunday and could lead to official coalition negotiations in a few weeks.   Having failed before Christmas to form a coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), Merkel is now leading an interim government with the SPD that is keeping things ticking over in Europe\u2019s biggest economy.  Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU alliance ruled in a \u2018grand coalition\u2019 with the SPD from 2013 to 2017 and, with investors fearing a protracted power vacuum that could delay reforms in Germany and the European Union, she is pressing for a re-run of that arrangement.  But the SPD has shown reluctance, with some of its members favoring a looser cooperation agreement or supporting a minority government.  The two blocs are at odds on issues from healthcare and immigration to Europe and pensions and, if no deal is done, Merkel\u2019s future as chancellor would be thrown into doubt with new elections a distinct prospect.

          "title": "Parties optimistic as matchmaker Merkel plans SPD coalition re-run",
          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s largest parties expressed optimism about the chances of forming a government after several hours of talks between the leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) she hopes to win as coalition partners.  Wednesday\u2019s joint statement from the parties, which talked of growing confidence, was good news for Merkel, whose reputation as Europe\u2019s consummate consensus-builder is on the line in this second bid to form a coalition government after weeks of sniping between its would-be partners.  Seeking a fourth term in office, Merkel saw her authority weakened in a national election in September, when support for her conservatives was eroded by the far right.  \u201cConfidence has grown and we are optimistic heading into the talks,\u201d read the joint statement, issued after three hours of talks between Merkel and other leaders of her Christian Democrats (CDU), her Bavarian CSU allies and the SPD.  She is under pressure to reach a deal with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), which also lost ground in the election, but the two sides have bickered over a range of issues, notably immigration and taxation.  SPD leader Martin Schulz praised the \u201cconcentrated, focused consultations\u201d he had had with leaders, which he said were a good basis for formal exploratory talks. The discussions are due to start on Sunday and could lead to official coalition negotiations in a few weeks.   Having failed before Christmas to form a coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), Merkel is now leading an interim government with the SPD that is keeping things ticking over in Europe\u2019s biggest economy.  Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU alliance ruled in a \u2018grand coalition\u2019 with the SPD from 2013 to 2017 and, with investors fearing a protracted power vacuum that could delay reforms in Germany and the European Union, she is pressing for a re-run of that arrangement.  But the SPD has shown reluctance, with some of its members favoring a looser cooperation agreement or supporting a minority government.  The two blocs are at odds on issues from healthcare and immigration to Europe and pensions and, if no deal is done, Merkel\u2019s future as chancellor would be thrown into doubt with new elections a distinct prospect.  In recent days some conservatives, especially from Bavaria, have stoked tensions by calling for tax cuts for high earners and reductions in benefits for asylum seekers, which the SPD opposes.      \u201cAgain verbal shenanigans from the Bavarian CSU,\u201d tweeted one of the SPD\u2019s deputy leaders, Ralf Stegner.  \u201cAlways the same recipe: humour the lederhosen public.

          "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - International and German investors have sued Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) for 740 million euros ($890 million) in connection with the bank\u2019s takeover of Postbank, their lawyer said on Wednesday.  Oliver Krauss, a lawyer at Munich-based firm Tricon, said Deutsche Bank should have paid his 31 clients, former Postbank shareholders, around 64 euros per share rather than the 25 euros they received when they accepted the takeover offer in 2010.  They argue, in a suit filed in late December in a district court in Cologne, that Deutsche Bank effectively took control of Postbank in 2008 when it bought a stake of just under 30 percent at a much higher price than 25 euros. They say as a result Postbank shareholders are entitled to a much higher price for their holdings.  A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said the complaint was unfounded, as were other similar suits that are currently making their way through the courts.  A spokeswoman for the court declined to comment.  German weekly WirtschaftsWoche first reported the lawsuit.   Krauss, citing client confidentiality, declined to provide a copy of the lawsuit but confirmed the accuracy of the WirtschaftWoche article.  WirtschaftsWoche said the lawsuit detailed examples of Postbank and Deutsche Bank acting in concert in 2008, including a strategy change to focus on retail customers and dropping riskier forms of business.  In addition, WirtschaftsWoche said Postbank and Deutsche Bank agreed on details of a planned capital increase, board changes and the elimination of a 2008 dividend.  December 31 marked a deadline for taking legal action on the takeover.  Reporting by Hans Seidenstuecker; Writing by Tom Sims. Editing by Jane Merriman"

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Although Britain generated most of its electricity from low carbon sources for the first time in 2017, it needs to invest more in clean energy to meet climate change targets, experts said on Wednesday.  Nuclear is the UK\u2019s largest source of low-carbon electricity at 21 percent, followed by wind at 15 percent and biomass at 9 percent, according to analysis by Carbon Brief, a website that covers energy policy, using data from Imperial College London.  \u201cEven though there\u2019s been good progress so far, there isn\u2019t enough new low-carbon generation that we know of to meet the UK\u2019s targets,\u201d Simon Evans, policy editor at Carbon Brief, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   Britain\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have fallen 42 percent since 1990, meaning it is half way toward meeting a legally binding target to cut these emissions by 2050 to 80 percent below 1990 levels.  It is investing in projects to support new nuclear technology, cut the cost of renewables and encourage people to buy low-emission vehicles, as Britain\u2019s aging coal and nuclear plants are due to close in the 2020s.    But initiatives to fund technology to capture carbon emissions from power plants and industry and store them underground have yet to produce a commercial-scale project.  Gas is the UK\u2019s main source of power, providing 40 percent of electricity, Carbon Brief\u2019s analysis showed.  \u201cNew nuclear costs are far higher than anticipated and carbon capture hasn\u2019t even got off the ground yet,\u201d Tom Jennings, policy director at the Carbon Trust, an environmental consultancy, said in emailed comments.   \u201cThe big challenges are low carbon transport - such as investment in electric vehicles - and heat.\u201d  Most of Britain\u2019s emissions reductions have occurred in the power and waste sectors, while emissions in the transport and building sectors are rising.   Shelagh Whitley, a climate expert at the London-based Overseas Development Institute, said that Britain must end fossil fuel subsidies to meet carbon targets.  \u201cThe government spends almost 200 million pounds a year subsidizing fossil fuel-based electricity production,\u201d she said in emailed comments.   \u201cThat extends the life of high-carbon assets, and makes it more challenging for alternative lower-carbon options to compete.\u201d  Reporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, Editing by Katy Migiro.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, boosted by a surge in new orders growth, in a further sign of strong economic momentum at the end of 2017.  The economy\u2019s robust fundamentals were also underscored by other data on Wednesday showing construction spending rising to a record high in November amid broad gains in both private and public outlays. Given the bullish growth outlook, economists expect the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in March after increasing borrowing costs three times last year.  \u201cStrong manufacturing and construction data confirm the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders at the turn of the year,\u201d said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. \u201cThe Fed remains solidly on track to lift rates again in March and two more times this year, with possible upside risk if growth doesn\u2019t simmer down.\u201d  The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 59.7 last month, the second-highest reading in six years, from 58.2 in November. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.    The survey\u2019s new orders sub-index shot up 5.4 points to 69.4, the highest reading since January 2004. Manufacturers also reported an increase in export orders. While a measure of factory employment fell 2.7 points last months it remained at lofty levels consistent with an expansion in manufacturing payrolls.  Factories also reported paying more for raw materials, with the survey\u2019s prices index jumping by 3.5 points. Rising raw material prices bolster the view that inflation will pick up in 2018.   Manufacturing is likely to get a boost this year from a $1.5 trillion tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress last month. The overhaul of the tax code, the most sweeping in 30 years, slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.   Business spending surged in anticipation of the corporate tax cuts.

It advanced 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.  The manufacturing and construction reports added to data ranging from the labor market to housing and consumer spending in sketching a robust picture of the U.S. economy.   Following Wednesday\u2019s data, the Atlanta Fed raised its  fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to an annualized rate of 3.2 percent. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the third quarter.  In November, spending on private residential projects soared 1.0 percent to the highest level since February 2007 after rising 0.3 percent in October.

          "body": "HOUSTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. shale oil and gas producer Gulfport Energy Corp has recruited Noble Energy Inc\u2019s head of Texas operations to serve as its next chief operating officer, a key role as Gulfport aims to rebound from the commodity price bust.  The move by Donnie Moore to Gulfport, announced late on Tuesday, deprives Noble of a key lieutenant who had been overseeing its Permian and Eagle Ford shale operations, one of Noble\u2019s fastest growing areas of operation.  Noble just last spring paid $2.7 billion for rival Clayton Williams Energy Inc to boost its presence in the Permian, acreage Moore had been helping to develop. Moore had previously worked in Noble\u2019s Colorado and U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations and for BP Plc.  Noble did not respond to requests for comment on Moore\u2019s exit. Moore begins his role at Gulfport on Monday.  The move will be a lucrative one for Moore, according to regulatory filings. He will receive an annual salary of $430,125 and a sign-on bonus of $250,000. Moore\u2019s compensation package at Noble was not publicly disclosed as he was not one of the company\u2019s five highest-paid employees. However, his new compensation plan eclipses that of some of his former Noble peers, according to filings.  Moore will be eligible for stock awards of $1.2 million that will vest over three years and stock grants worth 350 percent of his salary. He also be eligible for an annual cash bonus of 80 percent of his salary. Gulfport, which is based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, will pay up to $90,000 for Moore\u2019s moving expenses. Noble Energy is based in Houston.  Gulfport, a growing producer in Oklahoma and Ohio shale formations, had held a nationwide search for its operations chief. Gulfport Chief Executive Michael Moore cited Donnie Moore\u2019s experience boosting Noble\u2019s shale output as a key reason to hire him. The men are not related.  \u201cDonnie has demonstrated exceptional management and technical leadership throughout his career and I believe his proven track record will play a vital role in Gulfport\u2019s future success,\u201d CEO Moore said in a statement.  Shares of Noble rose 4 percent to $31.39 and shares of Gulfport rose 2 percent to $13.53 in Wednesday afternoon trading as crude prices rallied. (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Tom Brown)"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Drinking alcohol produces a harmful chemical in the body which can lead to permanent genetic damage in the DNA of stem cells, increasing the risk of cancer developing, according to research published on Wednesday.  Working with mice in a laboratory, British scientists used chromosome analysis and DNA sequencing to examine the genetic damage caused by acetaldehyde, a harmful chemical produced when the body processes alcohol.  Their findings offered more detail about how alcohol increases the risk of developing 7 types of cancer, including common forms such as breast and bowel cancer. It also showed how the body seeks to defend against the damage alcohol can do.  \u201cSome cancers develop due to DNA damage in stem cells. While some damage occurs by chance, our findings suggest that drinking alcohol can increase the risk of this damage,\u201d said Ketan Patel, a professor at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, who co-led the study.  The World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, citing \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d it causes cancer in humans.   A study published in 2011 found that alcohol is responsible for around 4 percent of all cancer in Britain - equating to around 12,800 cases a year.  In Wednesday\u2019s study, published in the journal Nature, Patel\u2019s team gave diluted alcohol to mice and then analyzed the effect on the animals\u2019 DNA. They found that acetaldehyde can break and damage DNA within blood stem cells, permanently altering the DNA sequences within these cells.  This is important, Patel said, because when healthy stem cells become faulty, they can give rise to cancerous cells.  The researchers also looked at how the body tries to protect itself against damage caused by alcohol. The first line of defense is a group of enzymes called aldehyde dehydrogenases or ALDHs, Patel explained. These break down the acetaldehyde into acetate, which cells can then use as a source of energy.  In the study, when mice lacking a critical ALDH enzyme were given alcohol, their DNA suffered four times as damage compared with mice with a properly functioning version of the enzyme.  Patel said cells also have a second line of defense in the form of a range of DNA repair systems which, most of the time, allow them to fix and reverse different types of DNA damage.   But in some instances and in some people - particularly people from South East Asia - the repair systems fail to work, meaning their cells are unable to repair effectively.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that alcohol clearance and DNA repair systems are not perfect, and alcohol can still cause cancer in different ways - even in people whose defense mechanisms are intact,\u201d Patel said.

          "title": "Age may be a factor in facial skin cancer treatment",
          "body": "(Reuters Health) \u2013 - In very elderly patients, less aggressive skin cancers on the face might not always need to be treated, a new study suggests.  Age of the patient and relative lifespan could be taken into consideration when discussing treatment for slow-growing facial nonmelanoma skin cancer, say the authors.  \u201cThere are multiple ways to treat, all cancers aren\u2019t the same, and skin cancer more often . . . is not lethal,\u201d coauthor Dr. Sunil Tholpady of the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis told Reuters Health.  Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma, Tholpady explained. \u201cThe decision to cut them out or treat them in some fashion should take into account the patient\u2019s lifestyle, their needs, and their wishes as long as they understand what the course of the cancer usually is,\u201d he said.  Tholpady and his colleagues studied 440 adults over age 40 with 569 non-melanoma skin cancers on the face.  About 55 percent were basal cell carcinomas and 30 percent were squamous cell carcinomas, they reported in JAMA Surgery.  Overall, in about a third of the cases, there was no cancer left in the skin after the lesion was removed for the biopy. This was true for roughly half of patients over age 90.  During the next several years, 50 patients died. Not surprisingly, the largest percentage of deaths was among patients in their 90s. No one died of the skin cancers, however.   In more than one in three patients above age 80, and in more than half of those above 90, simply removing the lesion for biopsy left the patients cancer-free. In other words, the researchers say, \u201ca large minority of patients\u201d would not have needed more extensive treatments.   Treatments for non-melanoma skin cancers range from immunomodulatory creams, to destructive therapies such as freezing, burning, shaving and lasers, to surgery, said Tholpady.  Further, his team points out, more than half of the patients who were in their 90s died within a year. \u201cThese small (cancers) would never have caused a problem,\u201d the authors write. Given that half of these oldest patients were free of cancer after their biopsies, \u201ca strong argument can be made for a watchful-waiting approach for the amenable nonagenarian,\u201d they add.  Dr. Brian Gastman, director of melanoma surgery at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, said a lot of money is spent every year on non-melanoma skin cancer, much of it in the elderly.  \u201cParticularly in the oldest-old, life expectancy \u201cin theory would be much less than any non-melanoma skin cancer would take to actually cause death, and many are not generally life-threatening,\u201d Gastman told Reuters Health by an email.  The idea that some non-melanoma skin cancers in elderly patients can be monitored without formal treatment is \u201cintriguing,\u201d said Gastman, but the new data are not definitive enough to change the standard of care.  The authors agree.  \u201cFuture studies are needed to investigate if a watchful-waiting approach is cost-effective and has higher patient satisfaction than surgical excision in this elderly population,\u201d they conclude.

Canadian cannabis producers Canopy Growth Corp and Aphria Inc were among the biggest gainers on the Toronto Stock Exchange\u2019s S&P/TSX composite index, surging as much as 11.9 percent and 17.5 percent respectively, although they pared some of those gains during the day. Aurora Cannabis, Canada\u2019s second-biggest listed producer, soared 25 percent. All hit record highs.  MJIC Inc's equal-weighted Canadian Marijuana Index, which tracks stocks of major cannabis companies, rose 14 percent, also a record high. [here ].  The U.S.-listed ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, which began trading on Dec. 26, has risen to $164 million in net assets from $6 million in one week, according to Vahan Ajamian, an analyst at Beacon Securities in Toronto. Top holdings include Canadian weed producers Cronos Group Inc and Canopy.  \u201cIf Americans want to buy Canadian stocks in an easy way, this is the first ETF that provides that ability in the U.S.,\u201d Chris Damas, editor of the BCMI Cannabis Report, said in an interview.  Still, he said that he considered the sector to be in a bubble. With investors from the U.S. and other countries seeking exposure to Canadian cannabis stocks, demand is far outpacing supply, he said.  California\u2019s legalization of recreational marijuana has also given legs to the Canadian rally. The state, with a population similar to the size of Canada\u2019s, is seen as a harbinger of the demand that can be expected when Canada legalizes adult use in mid-2018.  Reports of long lines and shortages in California were contributing to the positive sentiment, even though the only Canadian company with \u201cmeaningful direct exposure\u201d in the state was CannaRoyalty Corp, Ajamian said by email.

          "body": "This will be a big year for the Paris climate agreement. The broad outlines of the deal were figured out in 2015, but the specific rules governing what it requires countries to do will have to be written by the end of 2018.  In spite of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the accord, the deal appears surprisingly strong. In the final months of 2017, Nicaragua and Syria, the last two holdouts of the more than 190 nations that met in Paris, signed on. The United States, meanwhile, will not be able to withdraw from the agreement until November 4, 2020 \u2014 four years to the day after the agreement went into effect, and, coincidentally, one day after the next U.S. presidential election.  Now it\u2019s time to figure out the fine print. The process that must wrap up before the end of 2018 is comparable to the period after Congress passes any legislation, when regulatory agencies need to figure out what a given law will mean in practice. Over the course of 2018, negotiators from around the world will be working through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that undergirds the Paris Agreement, to do something similar.  At the top of their to-do list are rules for what the UN calls \u201ctransparency\u201d \u2014 that is, rules for measuring countries\u2019 emissions, and for measuring their progress toward reducing that pollution.  When each country signed on to the agreement, it offered a goal, or a \u201cnational determined contribution,\u201d stating how much it planned to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Over time, countries are expected to improve on those pledges. The Paris Agreement's objective is that these goals will gradually add up to a large enough reduction in global emissions that global warming can be contained within 2 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit.)  Transparency is essential to determine whether that 2-degree target is realistic. Practically speaking, the UN needs to figure out how countries will report their progress toward their emission-cutting goals. It will also need to figure out how to determine whether those reports are accurate. This will mean digging into topics that, during past rounds of negotiations, have proven to be complex and technically intricate.  When it comes to reporting, \u201cthe Paris Agreement itself essentially points to a common approach for countries but also acknowledges a need for flexibility for the countries that need it,\u201d says David Waskow, head of the DC-based World Resources Institute\u2019s International Climate Initiative. That \u201ccommon approach\u201d is key, and something that U.S. diplomats representing both Republican and Democratic administrations have pushed for years. If the UN has different standards for different countries \u2014 for instance, if it holds India and China to lower transparency standards than the European Union \u2014 then the agreement will be weakened at a time when it needs to get much stronger.  The flip side of those common reporting standards is flexibility. By allowing for some variation in the information that countries report, the UN acknowledges that not every country will be able to measure their greenhouse gas emissions with the same degree of accuracy.  A national government, Waskow explains, needs \u201cto know basic data about not only power plants but industrial facilities, what\u2019s happening with transportation systems and vehicles, what kind of fuels are being used, what\u2019s happening in the agriculture sector, what\u2019s happening with land use, et cetera. It requires government capacity not only at the national level but at the sub-national level \u2014 the city and state and provincial level \u2014 to be able to know what power plants and industrial facilities are in operation and at what level they\u2019re producing and emitting.\u201d  Not every county has that capacity. The specifics of how the UN deals with the range of data available is one of the things that must be figured out in 2018.  One of the goals of the Paris Agreement is that every country eventually will be able to report information with the same degree of accuracy. Initially, however, that won\u2019t be the case. So negotiators this year will have to write rules that require strong, accurate reports, but that leave developing countries some wiggle room.  Negotiators will also have to figure out how the UN will measure emissions outside national borders, including those from airplanes and boats in international waters. Planes and boats together account for about four percent of global emissions, by some estimates, and both air travel and maritime cargo shipping are expected to increase in coming years. Measuring these emissions will likely involve greater use of technology, especially satellites that can measure carbon dioxide and other climate change-causing pollutants from space.  A further complicating factor is the rule-writing role of the United States and China, the two countries that head the Paris Agreement\u2019s committee on transparency and which are also the world\u2019s top two carbon emitters. Washington has historically championed stronger transparency, but whether State Department diplomats will remain as invested in the issue given the nation\u2019s current one-foot-out-the-door status is unclear.  China, meanwhile, has at times balked at efforts to assess its role in climate change. In the past, the country has shared its own internal statistics on emissions but has refused to answer questions about how those statistics were calculated. China\u2019s data on coal use, a major contributor to its greenhouse gas emissions, has not always been reliable, and, at times, the country has dramatically revised past reports. But Chinese President Xi Jinping is trying to position his country as a global leader on climate change, a mantle the United States dropped when President Obama left office. Whether that means advocating for stronger transparency rules remains to be seen.  Ultimately, if the UN ends 2018 with strong rules on transparency, countries will have greater faith in the Paris Agreement. They\u2019ll know, with greater certainty, that what they\u2019re doing is making a difference.  Looking beyond 2018, countries will begin offering up stronger and stronger emissions-cutting pledges. Once the rules are written, those undertakings are \u201cthe other critical task,\u201d says Waskow. \u201cThose together will put the Paris Agreement fully into motion and make it a living, breathing thing with real consequence.\u201d  The transparency rules will not just determine whether the world avoids a dangerous level of climate change \u2014 they will determine whether countries have faith in the UN\u2019s delicate effort to protect the planet.

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Brazilian Captive Banks (Automakers) Dashboard here RIO DE JANEIRO, January 03 (Fitch) Despite signs of recovery, the Brazilian automotive sector remained challenged in 2017, with total sales still lagging pre-2015 figures. During 2017, Brazilian Captive Banks continued to play a key role for automakers, supporting both dealers' sales and final clients' financing in a still constrained credit market, according to Fitch Ratings Brazilian Captive Banks Dashboard. Despite some improvement, the domestic operating environment in 2018 is still uncertain due to local elections in Brazil, which can significantly affect the recovery speed of the sector, especially in the transportation and heavy equipment segments. Despite the substantial decline in BNDES disbursements since 2015 - a nominal reduction of 63% in 9M of 2017 in comparison with same period of 2014, due to the strong appetite for fixed income securities - Captive Banks were able to partially offset this funding gap with the issuance of term deposits and financial bills (domestic called Letras Financeiras). Fitch's  Brazilian Captive Banks Dashboard, examines the financial profile trends of 15 Brazilian banks linked with automakers. Key financial profile items covered in this report include 3Q'17 loan growth, asset quality, earnings, capitalization, funding and liquidity ratios and trends of the Captive Banks.

          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea reopened a border hotline with Seoul on Wednesday to discuss sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea\u2019s Pyeongchang next month.  Should the North attend the event, the two Koreas may march under a single flag at a sports opening ceremony for the first time in more than a decade and even compete as a single nation, experts and officials have suggested.  Such a move would be a powerful symbol of reconciliation amid a tense standoff over Pyongyang\u2019s defiant pursuit of nuclear and missiles programmes.  Games organising chief Lee Hee-beom previously raised the possibility of the two Koreas forming unified teams in figure skating and ice hockey for the Games to be held in the mountain village of Pyeongchang, just 80 km (50 miles) from the inter-Korean border.   The two Koreas have competed as a single nation in international table tennis and soccer games before but have never joined forces for multi-sports events such as the Olympics or Asian Games.  South and North Korea marched together at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics for the first time, after the two Koreas held its first-ever summit under South Korea\u2019s liberal Kim Dae-jung government.  Lee, president of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, also proposed North Korean athletes entering the South by crossing the heavily armed land border between the two Koreas.  That would be the first time that North Korean athletes would arrive the South by road, the organizer said. North Korea has not responded to Lee\u2019s proposals.  North Korea participated in the international multi-sports events hosted by South Korea three times - in 2002, 2003 and 2014.   The North boycotted the Seoul Olympics held in 1988. Nine months before those Games, North Korean agents detonated a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858, killing all 104 passengers and 11 crew.  2002 ASIAN GAMES, BUSAN (Sept 29-Oct 14)      North Korea sent a 606-member delegation, including 184 athletes, 288 cheerleaders and 134 officers to the 2002 Asian Games in the South Korean port city of Busan.   Athletes from the two Koreas paraded together at the opening and closing ceremonies, a spectacle not seen since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China as relations chilled under nearly a decade of conservative rule in the South.  The contingent traveled to the via North Korean flights and a cruise ship, using the vessel as their accommodation.  The female cheerleaders proved a huge attraction in South Korea with their good looks and tightly choreographed gymnastic routines, and became a feature of subsequent events in 2004 and 2005. Ri Sol Ju, now North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s wife, came to South Korea in 2005 as a North Korean cheerleader for the Asian Athletics Championships in Incheon, a lawmaker previously told reporters after being briefed by intelligence officials.  2003 SUMMER UNIVERSIADE, DAEGU (Aug 21-Aug 31)  A combined 528 North Koreans, including 303 cheerleaders and 94 athletes, attended the Games. The two Koreas marched together at the ceremonies.   North Korean athletes flew into South Korea and stayed at Daegu Bank Institute, a training facility for the local bank.  2014 ASIAN GAMES, INCHEON (Sept 19-Oct 4)  Pyongyang sent a total of 273 North Korean athletes and officials to the Games. They stayed at the athletes\u2019 village.   But Pyongyang dropped its plan to send a cheerleading squad amid deteriorating inter-Korean relations under the previous Park Geun-hye administration. Ahead of the Games, the North also threatened to pull out of the event, accusing the South of plotting to block its athletes from taking part.      The two Koreas did not march together at the ceremonies.   The North sent its most senior delegation ever to attend its closing ceremony with just 24 hours\u2019 notice. Kim allowed three of his top aides to fly aboard his personal jet to attend the event, while the athletes, who arrived in five installments including from Japan and Switzerland, took regular commercial flights of North Korea\u2019s Air Koryo.

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors closed out 2017 in the same cautious stance where they started the year, favoring bonds and world stocks over equities in their home market, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on Wednesday.  Stock funds attracted $4.1 billion during the week ended Dec. 27, the trade group said, with about 70 percent of that moving into funds focused on stocks abroad and the remainder into domestic-oriented products. Bond funds also attracted $4.1 billion.  The holiday week marked the 56th in a row of inflows for taxable-bond and world stock funds.  Investors have preferred those funds out of a belief that they can grow their investments and harvest income without over-committing to a U.S. stock market that has recorded nearly a decade of gains.  The ICI data covers mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based in the United States.  The S&P 500 index .SPX gained more than 19 percent in 2017, or nearly 22 percent if you count dividends, yet domestic equity funds posted outflows for the third straight year in 2017, according to preliminary data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit.

          "body": "UNITED NATIONS/SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, warned North Korea on Tuesday against staging another missile test and said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not do something to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.  Haley told reporters the United States was hearing reports that North Korea might be preparing to fire another missile.  \u201cI hope that doesn\u2019t happen. But if it does, we must bring even tougher measures to bear against the North Korean regime,\u201d Haley said.  South Korea on Tuesday offered talks with North Korea next week, amid a tense standoff over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Year\u2019s Day speech that he was \u201copen to dialogue\u201d with Seoul.  Kim also said he was open to the possibility of North Korean athletes taking part in Winter Olympics South Korea hosts next month.   At the same time, he stressed that his country would push ahead with \u201cmass producing\u201d nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions and that he had a nuclear button on his desk capable of launching missiles at the United States.  U.S. President Donald Trump responded to Kim in a Twitter post on Tuesday: \u201cWill someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d  Haley said the United States would not take talks seriously if they did not take steps toward banning North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons.  \u201cNorth Korea can talk to anyone they want, but the U.S. is not going to recognize it or acknowledge it until they agree to ban the nuclear weapons that they have,\u201d she said.  Haley gave no details of the missile test preparations.  Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were indications that could point toward a potential missile launch \u201csooner rather than later,\u201d but cautioned that such signs had been seen in the past and no test had resulted.  U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said North Korea might be \u201ctrying to drive a wedge of some sort\u201d between the United States and South Korea and added that while it was up to Seoul to decide who it talked to: \u201cWe are very skeptical of Kim Jong Un\u2019s sincerity in sitting down and having talks.\u201d  Trump, who has led a global drive to pressure North Korea through sanctions to give up development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States, earlier held back judgment on Pyongyang\u2019s offer to talk, saying on Twitter:  \u201cRocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. \u201cPerhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!\u201d  Trump has frequently derided Kim as \u201crocket man.\u201d The U.S. president said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea.   Kim and Trump have exchanged fiery barbs in the last year and the U.S. president has warned that the United States would have no choice but to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies.  North Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan and tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead anywhere in the United States.  South Korea\u2019s Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon said the offer for high-level talks next Tuesday had been discussed with the United States. Nauert said she was not aware if the matter had been discussed in advance of the South Korean response.   Cho suggested the talks be held at the border village of Panmunjom and said they should be focused on North Korea\u2019s participation at the Olympics, but other issues would likely arise, including the denuclearisation of North Korea.  \u201cI repeat: The government is open to talking with North Korea, regardless of time, location and form,\u201d Cho said.  Should the talks be held, it would be the first such dialogue since a vice-ministerial meeting in December 2015.       South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed Kim\u2019s New Year address and asked his government to move as quickly as possible to bring North Korea to the Olympics, but he stressed that an improvement in inter-Korean relations \u201ccannot go separately with resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear program\u201d.  China, which has persistently urged a return to talks to ease tensions, said recent positive comments from North and South Korea were a good thing.  \u201cChina welcomes and supports North Korea and South Korea taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearisation on the peninsula,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to the issuance of senior unsecured notes by Athene Holding Ltd. (Athene). The existing ratings of Athene and its affiliates are unaffected by today's rating action. Fitch last affirmed the ratings of Athene and its insurance operating subsidiaries on Dec. 21, 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes have been assigned a rating one notch below Athene's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), which reflects standard notching based on Fitch's rating criteria. Athene previously had no debt outstanding, but Fitch's current ratings on the company incorporate an expectation that the company would issue debt in the future and eventually maintain a run-rate financial leverage ratio of approximately 20%. The vast majority of the proceeds from the issuance are expected to be contributed to Athene's operating subsidiaries to support the block reinsurance transaction involving Voya Insurance and Annuity Company announced on Dec. 21, 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating sensitivities that could result in a rating upgrade include: --Further improvement in business profile driven by continued progress on diversification and clarity around implementation of new Department of Labor rules governing the sale of fixed-indexed annuities; --Maintenance of current capitalization metrics, including a Prism score of 'Very Strong'; --Maintain current level of operating performance. Key rating sensitivities that could result in a ratings downgrade include: --Large acquisitions that are either outside of Athene's historical risk preference and expertise or add significantly to the company's operating or financial leverage; --Significant changes in asset allocation, which may include an increase in limited partnership exposure to over 15% or a large increase in below investment-grade exposure; --Deterioration in Athene's operating performance, resulting in an ROE below 9%; --Prism score below 'Very Strong'. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following rating: Athene Holding Ltd. --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-'. Fitch currently rates Athene Holdings Ltd. as follows: --Issuer Default Rating 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Contact: Primary Analyst Bradley S.

          "title": "Egypt court postpones verdict against presidential hopeful: sources",
          "body": "CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian court on Wednesday postponed its verdict in a case against rights lawyer and presidential hopeful Khaled Ali, judicial sources said, leaving uncertainty over whether he will be allowed to run in a forthcoming election.  President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is widely expected to seek a second term in the presidential vote early this year, but has not yet announced his candidacy.  Ali said in November he intended to run against former military commander Sisi, who led the ousting of Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 before taking office a year later.  But a three month prison sentence passed in September for public indecency over an alleged rude hand gesture he made outside a courthouse last year might yet disqualify Ali.  Ali has appealed, denying the charges which he says are politically motivated. Wednesday\u2019s hearing at an appeals court delayed the final decision until March 7.  If the guilty verdict is upheld he will not be allowed to run, even if he is not jailed.  If the election takes place before March 7, however, Ali will be allowed to run, he and another lawyer said.  \u201cNothing stands in the way of my running,\u201d Ali told Reuters by phone.  \u201cThe (September) verdict ... has no value until it becomes final through an appeals court,\u201d he said.  Egypt will announce a date for the 2018 vote next week.  Ali, a socialist, ran in the 2012 election coming seventh. Mursi won that vote as Egypt\u2019s first freely elected president.  A judicial source said the appeals court had postponed its verdict while footage was examined to determine whether Ali made the alleged rude sign.  Ali gained prominence in January last year when he won a case that nullified a government transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, a deal that had prompted mass protests.  Sisi\u2019s critics say his popularity has been dimmed by austerity reforms, security problems and a crackdown on dissidents.   His allies dismiss accusations of rights abuses, saying his measures are needed for security in the face of an Islamist insurgency in the North Sinai region that has expanded to include civilian targets.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Six small U.S. oil and natural gas drilling projects will receive about $30 million in federal funding for research and development to help achieve President Donald Trump\u2019s policy of boosting output of fossil fuels, the Energy Department (DOE) said on Wednesday.  The projects, selected by the DOE under the direction of Congress, are in what is known as unconventional shale development. They currently produce less than 50,000 barrels per day each.  Unconventional oil and gas production uses advanced techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling to reach pockets of resources that are trapped by rock and sand formations.   The selected projects are at sites including the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale in Louisiana and Mississippi that has been estimated to contain 7 billion recoverable barrels of light, sweet crude oil and the Huron Shale in Appalachia, which is rich in natural gas.   Funding the projects \u201cwill help us master oil and gas development in these types of rising shales,\u201d and bolster the DOE\u2019s efforts to strengthen U.S. energy dominance, the department said in a release.  The projects will increase understanding of the behavior of oil and gas reservoirs, advance the completion of wells, and improve drilling technologies at offshore operations, the DOE said.  The project receiving the most DOE money is a study of reservoirs by Texas A&M\u2019s Engineering Experiment Station. The research will enable operators of thousands of existing horizontal wells that have undergone fracking to determine which of them can be fracked again, the DOE said. It will receive $8 million.  The field lab at Virginia Polytech Institute and State University will receive nearly $8 million for investigating the potential for reservoirs in the Nora Gas Field.  Among the other projects is C-Crete Technologies LLC in Stafford, Texas which will receive $1.5 million to develop well cement to prevent offshore oil spills and leaks under high temperatures, high pressure and corrosive conditions.

          "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google both discounted their virtual assistant speakers so deeply over the holiday shopping season that they likely lost a few dollars per unit, highlighting a sharply different strategy from Apple Inc  (AAPL.O) as it prepares its HomePod speaker, analysts said.  Both companies cut prices for the smallest version of their speakers, the Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home Mini, to as little as $29 from $50 for the U.S. holidays. Midlevel versions cost a bit more than twice as much.  Apple failed to ship its $349 HomePod speaker in 2017, as it initially planned, and said the device would go on sale in early 2018.  Apple aims to make a profit on the device itself and bolster sales of its $9.99 per month Apple Music subscription, analysts said. Apple\u2019s voice assistant Siri likely will focus on recommending new songs.  Amazon and Google, meanwhile, are eager to give consumers a taste of their respective digital assistants, Alexa and Google Assistant, at impulse-buy prices, hoping to lock in customers and profit from later sales of goods and data about buying habits.  The Home Mini and Echo Dot do not match the sound quality of the HomePod, but consumers may see less need for a superior, pricier speaker from Apple once they have a rival set up. Even the midlevel Amazon and Google devices were discounted to $79 over the holidays.  \u201cThat kind of pricing is great for consumers and bad for Apple,\u201d said Paul Erickson, a senior analyst with IHS Markit.  Some consumers might consider a $30 speaker to be cheap enough to throw away and not a barrier to buying the Apple device when it arrives.  Amazon declined to comment on Echo devices but said in a press release it sold millions of its Echo Dot speakers during the holiday season, making it the best-selling product over the period on its online store.  Google did not disclose sales numbers for the Home Mini, but Google Home spokeswoman Nicol Addison said the company was very happy with holiday performance. Google gave away the devices to buyers of its new Pixel 2 smartphones and offered them for $29 at Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy.   Amazon dominates the emerging market for smart speakers outside of China, with Google closest behind. Sales of the devices are not yet substantial enough to affect the financial results of either company.   Both companies took small losses or broke even on sales of the hockey puck-shaped devices, analysts estimated.  The Echo Dot has about $31 worth of parts, according to analysis by ABI Research. Components in the Google Home Mini cost about $26. The figures do not include overhead, shipping and other expenses, meaning discounted versions likely sold at a loss.  \u201cApple is in a bit of trouble,\u201d said Adam Wright, senior research analyst at IDC, who estimated that about 35 million smart speakers had been installed worldwide as of a couple of weeks ago - not including U.S. Christmas sales. \u201cWe\u2019ve witnessed an explosion in the last six months.\u201d  (This version of the story has been refiled to delete extra \u201csaid\u201d in paragraph nine)  Reporting by Paresh Dave and Stephen Nellis; editing by Peter Henderson and Grant McCool"

          "body": "(Includes details, background and context)  By Pete Schroeder  WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have reached a $45 million settlement with mortgage lender PHH Corp over alleged misconduct tied to its servicing of single-family mortgages.  The settlement announced on Wednesday resolves allegations that from 2009 to 2012 the lender failed to apply payments promptly, charged borrowers unauthorized fees, and threatened foreclosure to borrowers engaged in loss mitigation.  The company did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which stems from a 2010 examination conducted by the Multi-State Mortgage Committee, a panel of state mortgage regulators.  The settlement did not include the state of New Hampshire.  The company will follow comprehensive mortgage servicing standards, conduct audits and provide results to states under the deal. Over $30 million of the settlement funds will go toward affected borrowers.  The settlement comes as PHH Mortgage awaited a ruling from a U.S. appeals court in its fight against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB sued PHH Mortgage in 2014, charging it engaged in a mortgage insurance kickback scheme.  The company responded by challenging the CFPB\u2019s structure in court, arguing it was unconstitutional and the president should have the authority to fire its chief.  Under current law, the CFPB director can only be removed for cause. A panel on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. ruled in 2016 the agency\u2019s structure was unconstitutional. The regulator appealed that ruling, which is pending before the full court.  In August, PHH Mortgage agreed to pay $74.5 million to settle a separate U.S. probe over whether it generated defective loans that the federal government then insured and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought.

Stock funds attracted $4.1 billion during the week ended Dec. 27, the trade group said, with about 70 percent of that moving into funds focused on stocks abroad and the remainder into domestic-oriented products. Bond funds also attracted $4.1 billion.  The holiday week marked the 56th in a row of inflows for taxable-bond and world stock funds.

          "body": "* LME/ShFE arb: bit.ly/2wZSAEz (Adds closing prices)  By Pratima Desai  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Lead prices hit an 11-week high on Wednesday as expectations of seasonally strong demand and the likelihood of shortages over the winter months spurred investor buying.  Benchmark lead on the London Metal Exchange ended up 0.3 percent at $2,579 a tonne. Prices of the battery metal earlier touched $2,580, the highest since October 16.  \u201cThe severe cold snap in the US \u2014 with pictures of a nearly frozen Niagara Falls \u2014 refocused interest on lead,\u201d said Farid Ahmed, lead analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie.  \u201cPlunging temperatures raise the prospect of a surge in car battery failures leading to a spike in replacement battery demand. When this coincides with tight supply and low stocks, the prospect of an acute squeeze becomes a genuine concern.\u201d  Wood Mackenzie estimates the lead market will see a deficit of 115,000 tonnes this year and 56,000 tonnes in 2019 after a 119,000 shortfall last year.  WINTER: A major winter storm will start hitting the U.S Southeast up through New England on Wednesday with freezing rain, snow and strong winds, adding to record-shattering cold that is keeping its grip on much of the eastern United States.  CHINA: China accounts for about 40 percent of global lead demand estimated at around 12 million tonnes this year.  More than 80 percent of global lead consumption is for batteries mainly for autos. The biggest supply shortfall over coming months is seen in top consumer China due to an environmental crackdown on polluting industries.  SISTER-METAL: Lead is mined alongside zinc. Closures of major mines such as Century in Australia and Lisheen in Ireland and cutbacks by miners such as Glencore have left the market short of both metals.  Between 2014 and 2016 mined lead supply shrank by roughly 500,000 tonnes, or 10 percent of the global total.  \u201cMine closures have starved the market of new supply,\u201d said Societe Generale analyst Robin Bhar.  STOCKS: Inventories of lead in LME approved warehouses at 142,025 tonnes are down more than 25 percent since January last year. MPBSTX-TOTAL  POSITIONING: Large holding of LME warrants and cash contracts <0#LME-WHC> have also reinforced concerns about availability creating a premium of $9 a tonne for the cash over the three-month contract CMPB0-3. That differential on Dec. 27 was a discount of $11 a tonne.  DOLLAR: Weighing on industrial metals was a firmer U.S. currency, which when it rises makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for non-U.S. firms.  PRICES: Copper slipped 0.8 percent to $7,147 a tonne, aluminium fell 1.6 percent to $2,228, zinc lost 0.7 percent to $3,326.5, tin was down 0.7 percent to $19,900 and nickel ceded 1.7 percent to $12,400.

Germany\u2019s 10-year government bond yield fell 2 basis points to 0.44 percent DE10YT=TWEB, off two-month highs hit on Tuesday after weekend comments from the European Central Bank\u2019s Benoit Coeure that there was a \u201creasonable chance\u201d ECB stimulus will not be extended this year.  It held near those highs in early trade after ECB rate setter Ewald Nowotny echoed those comments in a German newspaper, before heading down.  Analysts said that a significant bond redemption in Germany helped explain the fall in yields.  Most core euro zone bond yields were down 1-4 bps on the day, with the gap between Italian and German 10-year bonds yields tightened to 160 basis points as Italian yields dropped as much as 6 bps to 2.03 percent. IT10YT=TWEB  \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way down in prices and we had a redemption in Germany, so there many have been some cash being put back to work,\u201d said Orlando Green, European fixed income strategist at Credit Agricole.  Ireland meanwhile kicked off its annual funding drive by raising 4 billion euros with a syndicated 10-year bond, covering around a quarter of its issuance target just three days into the year.  European stock and bond volumes were generally light after major new securities regulations came into force, although traders said there was little in the way of serious disruption.  Under the new MiFID II - or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II - rules, trades in financial assets and instruments must all be logged in a repository, forcing banks, asset managers and traders to report detailed information on trillions of euros of transactions.  Fixed income volumes were lower at 1000 GMT compared to their average at that time over the previous 30 days, according to data provider Trax, a subsidiary of MarketAxess that tracks around 65 percent of all secondary market deals.  The new regulatory regime was delayed by a year due to its complexity, and regulators have had to issue eleventh-hour guidance to banks and financial firms to avoid trading freezes as well as calming the nerves of those not yet fully compliant.  Strategists said they expected investors to refrain from making large trades until they had a clearer sense of the impact of the reform.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The rollout of new rules on Wednesday that aim to make European Union financial markets safer and more transparent has been glitch-free so far, though disruptions cannot be ruled out, the EU\u2019s markets watchdog said.  The new regime shines a spotlight on the inner workings of stock, bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to provide detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions.     Big banks spent an estimated $2 billion collectively last year to upgrade IT systems to prepare.  \u201cWhat we can see for our part, is no glitches so far,\u201d Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), told reporters.  \u201cIt will be the first time we have a complete overview of all financial instruments in the EU.\u201d  European stock and bond volumes were light in early trading.  \u201cSo far [there is] no difference compared to a regular day,\u201d said Markus Huber, a trader at City of London Markets.   \u201cVolume isn\u2019t expected to be massive or back to normal either due to not everybody being back from holidays, and not much going on in regard to major news or economic data.\u201d  Fixed income volumes were lower at 1000 GMT compared with their average at that time over the previous 30 days, according to data provider Trax, a subsidiary of MarketAxess that tracks around 65 percent of all secondary market bond deals.  Sterling corporate bond volumes were 46 percent lower than their 30-day average, with euro sovereign bond volumes 24 percent lower and sterling sovereign bond volumes 11 percent lower. Euro corporate bond volumes were 2 percent higher, according to Trax.  The new rules, known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), were delayed by a year to give banks, asset managers and exchanges more time to get ready.  Harps Sidhu, head of capital markets at consultants KPMG, said it would become clearer by the end of the week if transaction reporting was working properly.  \u201cThe key thing to realize is MiFID II isn\u2019t done. People are at various stages of readiness, which I think everyone accepts,\u201d Sidhu said.  Market nerves were eased by ESMA announcing measures just before Christmas to give companies more time to comply with some key requirements.  Regulators have said they will not crack down on poor compliance initially, as long as market participants show they are doing everything they can to get up to speed.  Maijoor said given the complexity and size of the reform, ESMA glitches could not be ruled out in coming days or weeks.  Regulators in Britain and Germany intervened just hours before MiFID went live to give three clearing houses an exemption from having to give customers more choice over where to clear some of their derivative contracts.  ICE Futures Europe (ICE.N), London Metal Exchange (0388.HK) and Eurex Clearing (DB1Gn.DE) were granted exemptions until July 2020 from opening themselves up to more competition.  Maijoor said this would be a \u201cone-off\u201d waiver and the new requirements for clearing houses would come into effect in 2020.  Alexandra Hachmeister, chief regulatory officer at Deutsche Boerse, said the waiver was needed for its Eurex arm because it was unclear how Britain\u2019s financial market will look once the UK has left the EU in 2019.  \u201cThat means that access provisions need to be thought about in an uncertain legal and regulatory environment,\u201d Hachmeister told CNBC news channel.  One of MiFID II\u2019s main objectives is to shift trading in stocks, bonds and derivatives from private venues called \u201cdark pools\u201d to \u201clit\u201d markets where everyone in the market can see the prices being offered.  A trader at one of Europe\u2019s largest inter-dealer brokers, which help investment banks trade with each other, said it had seen an increase in volumes on its public trading platforms on Wednesday as activity moved from dark pools.   \u201cOn the trading side, it seems that the exchanges benefit at the expense of these off-exchange markets,\u201d said Martin Van Vliet, a rates strategist at ING.  The rules also require that fund managers pay for research provided by investment analysts, a change that could lead to a fall in the number of reports that pour daily into professional investors\u2019 inboxes.    A fund manager at one of Europe\u2019s largest asset managers said he had received around a third fewer research reports compared with Tuesday.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - European shares recovered on Wednesday from a muted start to the year as a rising dollar boosted exporters and new records on Wall Street lifted spirits on a day devoted to the implementation of the new European MiFID II market rules.  Euro zone blue chips .STOXX50E gained 0.6 percent and the pan-European STOXX 600  index closed up 0.5 percent while trading volumes were slightly up from the previous session despite new financial regulations kicking in.       A greenback rally triggered by upbeat U.S. manufacturing and construction data ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy meeting minutes helped blue chips in France and in Germany.    Frankfurt's DAX .GDAXI and Paris' CAC 40 .FCHI both jumped 0.9 percent.   \u201cIt\u2019s a recovery session\u201d, said Pierre Martin, a senior sales at Saxo Bank, noting that apart from the favorable currency effect, oil prices gave a boost to energy stocks and that other sectors, such as retail, industrials, healthcare or technology, had also supported indexes.   Shares in British retailer Next (NXT.L) rose 6.7 percent after it raised profit guidance on better than expected Christmas sales.  Next is the first major listed retailer to give an update on Christmas trading, but its optimistic update lifted other retailers such as Ocado (OCDO.L), up 7.7 percent or Primark owner Associated British Foods (ABF.L), up 2.1 percent.   \u201cAs much as (Next\u2019s) update is good news, the constant update-by-update tinkering of guidance and sharp reactions by the share price just goes to show how shareholders are at the mercy of UK consumer trends and whims,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.      \u201cThe retail sector is a very tricky one.\u201d  Europe\u2019s retail index .SXRP, one of the major underperformers of 2017,  was up 0.7 percent.  Europe\u2019s energy sector .SXEP built on the previous sessions\u2019 gains with a 1.25 percent advance, helped by firmer oil prices which rose to the highest in 2-1/2 years as unrest continued in OPEC member Iran.

          "body": "(Adds details on grain business, quotes)  By Tom Polansek  CHICAGO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Cargill Inc reported a 6 percent drop in quarterly profits on Wednesday as a global glut of grains limited trading opportunities for the food-commodities merchant.  Four years of bumper grain and oilseeds harvests have squeezed profits for Cargill and main rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd and Louis Dreyfus Corp . Traders expect more of the same next year, prompting cost cuts.  Of Cargill\u2019s four business segments, its unit that buys, trades and processes grains and oilseeds was the only one that saw quarterly earnings decline from a year ago. It was the eighth time in the past 14 quarters the unit posted a year-on-year decline, reflecting pressure from massive inventories, reduced price volatility and clipped margins.  \u201cVery large U.S. corn and soybean crops added to the buildup in global stocks that has weighed on markets, diminishing price volatility and lessening trading opportunities,\u201d spokeswoman Lisa Clemens said.  Trading performance in North America and oilseed processing in Asia stayed ahead of the same quarter last year, Cargill said. Still, the unit\u2019s overall decline was offset by higher profits in the company\u2019s animal-nutrition business, which sells ingredients for livestock and fish feed.  Cargill and its rivals have been investing in higher-margin businesses, such as food ingredients, to make up for the slump in their core grain trading and processing operations.  It said it invested about $1 billion during the quarter that ended on Nov. 30 on projects including a $90 million biodiesel facility in Kansas that will increase demand for U.S. soybeans.  Competitors are taking similar steps.  ADM has reconfigured an Illinois ethanol facility to produce higher-margin industrial and beverage alcohol and fuel for the export market. The company has also cut its global workforce and plans to reallocate funds to its high-value business from oilseed crushing.  Bunge fended off a bid from Glencore Plc last year and promised extensive cost-cutting in a sweeping restructuring.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be made from trade, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Jim Gerlach, president of Indiana-based grain broker A/C Trading.  Privately held Cargill said net earnings fell 6 percent to $924 million a year ago and adjusted operating earnings were down 8 percent at $948 million. Revenue rose 8 percent to $29.2 billion.

          "body": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Gusting winds blew a train off its tracks, injuring eight people, as winter storm Burglind battered Switzerland on Wednesday, bringing trees down on power lines cutting electricity to thousands of homes.  The wind derailed the lead car on the Montreux-Bernese Oberland (MOB) regional train around midday near Lenk in central Switzerland, an MOB spokesman said.  \u201cI have never seen anything like it,\u201d he added.  Gusts on the Pilatus peak near Lucerne hit 195 kph (122 mph), the highest there since records began in 1981, broadcaster SRF reported.  The Swiss weather service issued strong gale warnings for much of the country. Many roads were closed, passenger ferry traffic was halted in some areas and several air flights were canceled.  Media websites featured pictures and video of the havoc: a  light airplane was overturned in Stans, wind tore scaffolding from a construction site near Lucerne, and tractor-trailers were blown onto their sides on some major motorways.  Several people were stranded on a ski lift in St Gallen canton when trees toppled onto the gondola lines, police said.  In the capital Bern, the Christmas tree on display at the main railway station snapped at mid-morning, but no one was injured by the 13-metre high trunk that weighs 2.4 tonnes, Swiss broadcaster RTS said, showing a photo of it on the pavement.  In the Netherlands, a storm disrupted air travel at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport, Europe\u2019s third busiest.  More than a fifth of the originally planned 1,200 incoming and outgoing flights were canceled as wind gusts reached speeds of up to 120 kph (75 mph).   Storms also prompted authorities to close all five major sea barriers to prevent flooding in the lowlands.  In France, a skier was killed when a tree fell on him on a ski slope and at least 15 others were injured in storms in northern and eastern regions that cut power to some 225,000 homes, local authorities said.  Households in the Normandy region were the worst hit by storm Eleanor, Enedis, a unit of state-controlled EDF said, while the area around Paris and northeastern Picardie and Champagne-Ardenne were also among those affected.   The latest weather warning and strong winds come after winter storm Carmen battered western France on New Year\u2019s day, with some 40,000 households in the Brittany region temporarily losing power.   Homes and businesses on Ireland\u2019s west coast suffered flood damage and 27,000 were left without electricity on Wednesday when Eleanor brought heavy rain and winds of up to 155 kph (96 mph) per hour, hitting the fourth largest city, Galway, particularly hard.

          "body": "* FTSE 100 up 0.3 pct  * Next leads retailers up after Christmas trading surprise  * Dollar recovery boosts shares (Adds closing prices, details)  By Helen Reid  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s main stock index rose 0.4 percent to within a whisker of its recent record high, reversing an earlier swoon as oil majors jumped higher and the U.S. dollar gained back ground against sterling, helping UK-listed dollar earners.  Oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP delivered the biggest boost to the index as crude prices hit new two-and-a-half year highs, rising 1.5 percent and 1.3 percent.  Retailers stole the rest of spotlight after high street stalwart Next delivered a strong Christmas update.  Next jumped 6.7 percent to the top of the index after its trading update surprised investors, with a sales beat driving the company to upgrade its full-year profit forecast.  Cheery results from the first UK retailer to report on the Christmas season caused a rally in retail stocks across the market, delivering relief to investors in a sector facing significant challenges.  Mid and small-caps also jumped, with the FTSE 250 and the FTSE small caps rising 0.3 and 0.5 percent respectively.  Next\u2019s update was in stark contrast to the start of 2017 when the retailer issued a profit warning and its shares sank.  But Wednesday\u2019s gains only brought it back to November levels before a third-quarter sales miss, and some were sceptical about how significant this sales performance was.  \u201cThe Next share price rollercoaster continues,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.  \u201cManagement\u2019s update-by-update tinkering of guidance and sharp share price reactions only goes to reinforce how shareholders remain at the mercy of the UK consumer from one season to the next and exposed to short-termism.\u201d  Fashion retailer N Brown rose 7 percent and shares in small-cap department store Debenhams rose 1.2 percent.  Marks & Spencer up 1.3 percent while Primark owner ABF gained 2.1 percent.  The gains across the board in retail were likely to have squeezed the many short sellers betting on the sector\u2019s downfall. Of the top ten most-shorted FTSE 100 stocks, five are in retail.  EU regulatory reforms under the MiFID II market directive that came into force on Wednesday had little early impact on the market, traders said.  Reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"

          "body": "NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify has filed confidentially for an initial public offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is moving ahead with a direct listing in the first half of the year, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.  If Spotify, with was valued at as much as $19 billion last year, goes ahead with its plans, it would make it the first major company to carry out a direct listing, an unconventional way to pursue an IPO without raising new capital.  It also mainly eliminates the need for a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite an IPO along with many associated fees and could change the way companies approach selling shares to the public.  The confidential filing was initially reported by news outlet Axios.  Spotify is the biggest global music streaming company and counts Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc as its main rivals. Reuters has previously reported Spotify was aiming to file for an IPO in late 2017 and list with the New York Stock Exchange early this year.  Spotify could not be reached for comment.  Spotify was sued by Wixen Music Publishing Inc last week for allegedly using thousands of songs, including those of Tom Petty, Neil Young and The Doors, without a license and compensation to the music publisher. It was unclear what the lawsuit\u2019s effect would be on its IPO plans.  Wixen, an exclusive licensee of songs such as \u201cFree Fallin\u2019\u201d by Tom Petty, \u201cLight My Fire\u201d by the Doors, (Girl We Got a) Good Thing by Weezer and works of singers such as Stevie Nicks, is seeking damages worth at least $1.6 billion along with injunctive relief.  Spotify still intends to proceed with a U.S. direct listing in the first half of 2018, despite the lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the matter. It has filed for the listing confidentially with the SEC, with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Allen & Co helping arrange it, the source added.

          "body": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s supporters got a boost on Wednesday when a key ally of the elderly leader announced he would head a group campaigning for him to seek re-election next year.  Buhari, 75, has not publicly said whether he will take part in the February 2019 election. Political insiders have privately questioned Buhari\u2019s willingness, or ability, to keep the top job after he spent much of the past year in Britain being treated for an undisclosed ailment that left him visibly weakened.  But Adebayo Shittu, Nigeria\u2019s minister of communications who played a prominent role in Buhari\u2019s 2015 campaign, said he would chair a group to support the re-election of the president and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.  Campaigning for the re-election of a president in Nigeria has often started with such support groups before the incumbent declares his intention to run again.  \u201cWe, his ardent supporters who appreciate his worth on behalf of millions of Nigerians, would urge him to recontest,\u201d Shittu told reporters in the capital Abuja after informing Buhari of his plans to head the group.  \u201cI know he has not made up his mind but I can say that some of us can assist him in making up his mind,\u201d he added.  The fact that Shittu discussed campaign arrangements with Buhari and then told reporters is a sign that the president may  have given his approval.  On Jan. 20 an office for the organization of the campaign will be set up in Nigeria\u2019s southwest, Shittu said.  The southwest is a key region in Nigerian elections, home to the sprawling megacity of Lagos, where widespread support for Buhari in 2015 is credited with helping him defeat the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan.  But while Buhari in 2015 rode a wave of resentment against Jonathan over endemic government corruption, a struggling economy and a failure to defeat the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast, much of public opinion has now turned against Nigeria\u2019s incumbent leader.  Many Nigerians complain that Buhari\u2019s government is also corrupt, pointing to the president\u2019s sacking of his top civil servant and the head of the National Intelligence Agency in October after highly-public graft scandals.  Others dispute how well the economy, Africa\u2019s largest, has recovered. Nigeria exited its first recession in 25 years in the second quarter of 2017, but growth remains sluggish and the country continues to depend on oil, while unemployment and underemployment have increased.  Boko Haram\u2019s deadly attacks also continue to plague the military and civilians in the northeast almost daily, despite the Buhari administration\u2019s insistence over the past two years that the insurgency has been beaten.  In a blow to the president, Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and key Buhari ally, quit the ruling All Progressives Congress and said he was prepared to run in 2019. Last month he joined the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party.  Reporting by Felix Onuah in Abuja; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Gareth Jones"

The 22-year old U.S skier from Vail, Colorado, finished the two legs in one minute 53.07 seconds, a staggering 1.59 seconds ahead of Swiss runner-up Wendy Holdener, with Sweden\u2019s Frida Hansdotter climbing from fifth to third after a fine second run.  Shiffrin, who won her maiden overall World Cup title last season, tops the standings with 1081 points and is also in the driving seat in the slalom on 580 points with the Feb 9-25 Games in South Korea\u2019s Pyeongchang beckoning.  She set the pace after starting fourth out of the blocks in the opening leg and carved out an advantage of 1.41 seconds over Holdener and 1.61 ahead of Slovakia\u2019s Petra Vlhova.  Heavy snowfall on a soft course in the second leg, when the top 30 skiers start in reverse order, did not deter the American as she produced another flawless run to cross the finish line as the event\u2019s emphatic winner.  Shiffrin is widely expected to retain the Olympic slalom title she won at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia, as well as to have a shot at gold medals in the giant slalom and Super G.  Earlier on Wednesday, former American great Bode Miller heaped praise on his compatriot in an interview with Reuters.  \u201cI think she\u2019s maybe the best ski racer I\u2019ve ever seen, male or female,\u201d said the 40-year-old. \u201cShe\u2019s so balanced, dynamic, intense and focused, so for me, I think she\u2019s got a chance in any event she skis in.\u201d  Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic; Editing by Ian Chadband"

Euronext, which trades derivatives mostly based on agricultural commodities, has been preparing to publish weekly commitments of traders (COT) reports to meet the requirements of the new EU rules, known as MiFID II, that came into effect on Wednesday.  The new rules aim to increase transparency in Europe\u2019s financial markets so regulators can spot risks early and also enable investors to shop around more.  COT data, already a feature of U.S. commodity markets, gives a clearer picture of trading activity by providing information on who has been buying and selling which products.

          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Wednesday it had cracked a Palestinian militant cell suspected of having been recruited and handled by Iranian intelligence officers who worked out of South Africa, but the suspects\u2019 lawyer denied the charges.  Israel has long been locked in a shadow war with arch-foe Iran, which supports Islamist guerrillas in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon and whose nuclear program is widely believed to have been targeted repeatedly by Israeli saboteurs.    Israel\u2019s Shin Bet security agency said three Palestinians from the occupied West Bank had been indicted on espionage and terrorism charges after they confessed to accepting Iranian-assigned missions, including preparation of a suicide bombing and providing their handlers with Israeli cellphone SIM cards.  In its statement, the Shin Bet said the suspects\u2019 point of contact was a Palestinian who lived in South Africa and had been recruited by Iranian intelligence. It gave no indication whether the South African government knew of the alleged Iranian activity, or of the Palestinian expatriate\u2019s whereabouts.  South Africa, where pro-Palestinian sentiment is strong, has strained relations with Israel, but the Shin Bet statement also suggested the country effectively served as an Iranian spy hub.  \u201cIt became clear, during the the Shin Bet investigation, that Iranian intelligence used South Africa as a significant arena for locating, recruiting and running anti-Israel agents in the West Bank,\u201d the Shin Bet said, adding that several Iranian officers had traveled there \u201cfrom Tehran\u201d for the operation.  South Africa\u2019s Foreign Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry, and the Iranian embassy in Pretoria, did not immediately respond to the Israeli allegations.   The three Palestinians were arrested in November and a trial date has yet to be set, their lawyer, Munther Abu Ahmed, said.  \u201cThe three young men denied the charges against them,\u201d Abu Ahmed told Reuters. Two of them had been in touch with a relative in South Africa \u201cabout business and commercial issues,\u201d he said, adding that their most recent meeting was in July 2016.  \u201cWe are in 2018 and none of the three men has done anything, and that refutes the charges against them,\u201d Abu Ahmed said.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Wednesday the case showed that \u201cIran operates in a subversive and terrorist manner ... not just in aiding terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, but also in attempts to organize terror activities within the State of Israel against its civilians\u201d.   A Shin Bet veteran interviewed by Israel Radio about the case suggested the purported South African link may be unprecedented.  \u201cApparently the Iranians found fertile ground in South Africa,\u201d said ex-officer Adi Carmi, adding: \u201cI do not recall South Africa ever having been used by the Iranians as a terrorist recruiting ground for the aim of carrying out attacks.\u201d  Additional reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza and Ed Stoddard and Mfuneko Toyana in Johannesburg; Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Gareth Jones"

          "title": "Nigeria's Buhari re-election movement gathers pace for 2019",
          "body": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s supporters got a boost on Wednesday when a key ally of the elderly leader announced he would head a group campaigning for him to seek re-election next year.  Buhari, 75, has not publicly said whether he will take part in the February 2019 election. Political insiders have privately questioned Buhari\u2019s willingness, or ability, to keep the top job after he spent much of the past year in Britain being treated for an undisclosed ailment that left him visibly weakened.  But Adebayo Shittu, Nigeria\u2019s minister of communications who played a prominent role in Buhari\u2019s 2015 campaign, said he would chair a group to support the re-election of the president and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.  Campaigning for the re-election of a president in Nigeria has often started with such support groups before the incumbent declares his intention to run again.  \u201cWe, his ardent supporters who appreciate his worth on behalf of millions of Nigerians, would urge him to recontest,\u201d Shittu told reporters in the capital Abuja after informing Buhari of his plans to head the group.  \u201cI know he has not made up his mind but I can say that some of us can assist him in making up his mind,\u201d he added.  The fact that Shittu discussed campaign arrangements with Buhari and then told reporters is a sign that the president may  have given his approval.  On Jan. 20 an office for the organization of the campaign will be set up in Nigeria\u2019s southwest, Shittu said.  The southwest is a key region in Nigerian elections, home to the sprawling megacity of Lagos, where widespread support for Buhari in 2015 is credited with helping him defeat the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan.  But while Buhari in 2015 rode a wave of resentment against Jonathan over endemic government corruption, a struggling economy and a failure to defeat the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast, much of public opinion has now turned against Nigeria\u2019s incumbent leader.  Many Nigerians complain that Buhari\u2019s government is also corrupt, pointing to the president\u2019s sacking of his top civil servant and the head of the National Intelligence Agency in October after highly-public graft scandals.  Others dispute how well the economy, Africa\u2019s largest, has recovered. Nigeria exited its first recession in 25 years in the second quarter of 2017, but growth remains sluggish and the country continues to depend on oil, while unemployment and underemployment have increased.  Boko Haram\u2019s deadly attacks also continue to plague the military and civilians in the northeast almost daily, despite the Buhari administration\u2019s insistence over the past two years that the insurgency has been beaten.  In a blow to the president, Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and key Buhari ally, quit the ruling All Progressives Congress and said he was prepared to run in 2019. Last month he joined the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party.  Reporting by Felix Onuah in Abuja; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Gareth Jones"

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission said on Wednesday it found that tool chests imported from China harm U.S. producers, paving the way for the Commerce Department to keep anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties on Chinese exporters for five years.  The case was brought by Waterloo Industries Inc of Sedalia, Missouri, a subsidiary of Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc (FBHS.N), which says it accounts for more than one-half of domestic production of tool chests and cabinets.  In 2016, the value of imports of tool chests from China totalled $990 million, Commerce Department data show.  On Nov. 22, the Commerce Department calculated final countervailing or anti-subsidy duty rates of 15.09 percent for Jiangsu Tongrun Equipment Technology Co Ltd (002150.SZ), 14.03 percent for Zhongshan Geelong Manufacturing Co Ltd, and 14.39 percent for all other producers or exporters in China that responded to its inquiries.  Companies that did not respond to the department\u2019s questionnaire were assigned a final subsidy rate of 95.96 percent.  In a separate anti-dumping investigation, the Commerce Department said on Nov. 13 it had made a preliminary finding that certain companies from China were selling tool chests on the U.S. market at 90.40 percent to 168.93 percent below fair value.  As part of that same finding, the department calculated a preliminary anti-dumping rate of 230.31 percent for Vietnam\u2019s Clearwater Metal Single Entity.

          "body": "GAZA (Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority said on Wednesday it asked Israel to fully restore Israeli electricity flows to the Gaza Strip, a move that could nearly double the daily connection time in an enclave suffering severe power shortages.    There was no immediate word from Israel whether it would comply at a time when it says the Islamist Hamas group, which controls Gaza, bears overall responsibility for recent cross-border rocket attacks launched by smaller militant factions.  In a statement, Hussein Al-Sheikh, Palestinian minister of civil affairs, said the Palestinian Authority would again guarantee payment of Gaza\u2019s Israeli electricity bill and ask Israel to restore the 50 megawatts of power, out of a total 120 megawatts, that it had supplied to the area.  A statement issued by Prime Minister Rami Al-Hamdallah said the request was to \u201calleviate the suffering of the people of Gaza and to improve living conditions.\u201d  Gaza\u2019s two million residents now receive only three to four hours of electricity a day, with schools, factories, hospitals and households affected. A Gaza economist said restoration of power from Israel, the enclave\u2019s main electricity supplier, could raise that figure to six hours. Gaza\u2019s sole power station generates only a small amount of electricity.  In April, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced he was cancelling the guarantee, part of a bid to press Hamas to loosen its hold over the enclave, a decade after the Islamist movement seized the territory from forces loyal to him.  Prompted partly by Abbas\u2019s sanctions and fears of financial and political isolation, Hamas signed an Egyptian-brokered reconciliation agreement with his Fatah movement in October and agreed to hand over administrative control of the Gaza Strip to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority.  But both groups have failed to finalize details of the deal, which had been due to be completed on December 1. The Authority\u2019s decision to resume the electricity payments could help smooth the way towards completing the accord.  The PA\u2019s request coincides with heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions.   Palestinians have been mounting protests in the occupied West Bank and violence has flared along the Israel-Gaza border since U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Dec. 6 that he was recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  In the West Bank on Wednesday, Israeli troops shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian during a confrontation with stone-throwing protesters, Palestinian medics said. An Israeli military spokeswoman said he appeared to have been holding a firearm.  His death raised to 13 the number of Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli forces since Trump\u2019s declaration, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. There have been no Israeli fatalities or serious injuries in the confrontations or as a result of the rocket strikes.  Two Hamas gunmen were killed in one Israeli retaliatory air strike in December.

          "body": "ZAGREB (Reuters) - Overall World Cup leader Mikaela Shiffrin gave herself another confidence boost ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics after blowing away the field to win a third successive women\u2019s slalom at Zagreb\u2019s Mt Sljeme on Wednesday.  The 22-year old U.S skier from Vail, Colorado, finished the two legs in one minute 53.07 seconds, a staggering 1.59 seconds ahead of Swiss runner-up Wendy Holdener, with Sweden\u2019s Frida Hansdotter climbing from fifth to third after a fine second run.  Shiffrin, who won her maiden overall World Cup title last season, tops the standings with 1081 points and is also in the driving seat in the slalom on 580 points with the Feb 9-25 Games in South Korea\u2019s Pyeongchang beckoning.  She set the pace after starting fourth out of the blocks in the opening leg and carved out an advantage of 1.41 seconds over Holdener and 1.61 ahead of Slovakia\u2019s Petra Vlhova.  Heavy snowfall on a soft course in the second leg, when the top 30 skiers start in reverse order, did not deter the American as she produced another flawless run to cross the finish line as the event\u2019s emphatic winner.  Shiffrin is widely expected to retain the Olympic slalom title she won at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia, as well as to have a shot at gold medals in the giant slalom and Super G.  Earlier on Wednesday, former American great Bode Miller heaped praise on his compatriot in an interview with Reuters.  \u201cI think she\u2019s maybe the best ski racer I\u2019ve ever seen, male or female,\u201d said the 40-year-old. \u201cShe\u2019s so balanced, dynamic, intense and focused, so for me, I think she\u2019s got a chance in any event she skis in.\u201d  Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic; Editing by Ian Chadband"

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.52 percent while MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.46 percent higher as manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy.  Emerging market stocks rose 0.57 percent, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 0.08 percent.  The dollar index rose 0.24 percent, snapping a three-week losing streak, after stronger-than-forecast U.S. manufacturing and construction data.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.05 percent versus the greenback at 112.35 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3518, down 0.50 percent on the day.  The euro was down 0.26 percent to $1.2026.  U.S. Treasury yields trimmed their earlier fall on Wednesday after an upbeat report on U.S. manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management.  Investors are also awaiting the release later on Wednesday of minutes from last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. During the meeting, Fed policy makers decided to raise short-term interest rates for a third time in 2017.  Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.4489 percent, from 2.465 percent late on Tuesday.  The 30-year bond last rose 10/32 in price to yield 2.7949 percent, from 2.81 percent late on Tuesday.  Hawkish comments from two European Central Bank officials sent yields higher on Tuesday, with the 10-year German Bund yield hitting a two-month peak and the five-year U.S. yield reaching its highest level since April 2011.  Some investors said Tuesday\u2019s yield rise was in part a reversal of the drop linked to typical year-end buying.  \u201cA majority of yesterday\u2019s move was a move back of what happened over the year-end holiday,\u201d said Jason Celente, senior portfolio manager at Insight Investment in New York.  Elsewhere, spot gold reached its highest since mid-September on Wednesday, before edging back to $1,316.36 per ounce.  Oil prices hit fresh two-and-a-half year highs as strong output in the United States and Russia balanced tensions from a sixth day of unrest in OPEC member Iran.

          "title": "Bannon calls Trump Jr meeting with Russians 'treasonous' -book",
          "body": "(Editors: note language in paragraph 5)  WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has called a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians attended by Donald Trump Jr. and his father\u2019s top campaign officials \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic,\u201d according to excerpts of a new book seen by Reuters on Wednesday.  Bannon expressed derision and astonishment over the meeting in Trump Tower in New York in which a Russian lawyer was said to be offering damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to the book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff.  The meeting arranged by Trump\u2019s son also included Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. It has become part of a federal investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election. Trump has denied any such collusion.  \u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers,\u201d Bannon said in the book in excerpts seen by Reuters.  \u201cEven if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.\u201d  When an intermediary proposed the meeting, saying the Russians were offering damaging information about Clinton, Trump Jr. responded in an email, \u201cI love it.\u201d  Bannon was incredulous about the meeting shortly after it was revealed, according to the book, concluding sarcastically, \u201cThat\u2019s the brain trust they had.\u201d  The book, due out next Tuesday, was based on more than 200 interviews with Trump, senior White House staffers and confidantes conducted by Wolff, a contributing editor for The Hollywood Reporter, according to publisher Henry Holt.  There was no immediate comment from the White House or Bannon on the book details, first reported by the Guardian. The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Trump Jr.  Bannon became Trump\u2019s campaign manager in the months before the November 2016 election, but after the Trump Tower meeting, and was chief White House strategist during the turbulent first eight months of Trump\u2019s presidency.  Trump fired Bannon in August, removing a far-right architect of his election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti-globalization agenda.  In the book, Bannon also said he believed the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow will focus on money laundering.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV,\u201d Bannon was quoted as saying.  Manafort and business associate Rick Gates, who also worked on Trump\u2019s campaign, pleaded not guilty in November to federal charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine\u2019s former pro-Russian government.

          "body": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank\u2019s purchases of corporate bonds slowed last month to their lowest level since it started buying company debt almost two years ago, data showed on Wednesday.  The ECB has been buying government bonds since 2015, in an effort to boost inflation in the euro zone, and added credit to the program a year later. It is widely expected to wind down the program this year, having already reduced its pace to 30 billion euros ($36 bln) per month.    Credit is expected to account for a growing share of the purchases this year as the ECB nears a cap on how many government bonds it can own in countries such as Germany and Portugal.  But Frankfurt bought just 3.08 billion euros ($3.7 billion) worth of company debt last month, less than half the amounts acquired in each of the previous three months.   While purchases of government bonds, the largest component of the ECB\u2019s stimulus program, were also curbed, the reduction there was less marked as they fell to 46.2 billion euros from 50.7 billion a month earlier.  In total, the ECB bought 50.2 billion euros worth of assets in December, a month when it normally reduces the pace of buying due to low trading volumes on financial markets around Christmas.  As has been the case for months, the ECB bought fewer government bonds from Germany, Portugal and Finland than its rules dictate, making up for it with oversized purchases in Spain, France and Italy.  The ECB set out to buy bonds based on how much capital each country has paid into Frankfurt\u2019s coffers, which in turn depends on the size of its economy.  But it has had to deviate from this rule, introduced to overcome German scepticism when the scheme was launched in 2015, to avoid hitting a self-imposed ban on owning more than a third of each country\u2019s debt.

Pressure is growing on Germany to tackle diesel pollution as dozens of cities including Munich and Stuttgart, where BMW and Daimler are based, could face penalties for allowing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in excess of European Union limits introduced in 2010, the DUH environmental lobby has said.  Sales of diesel-engine cars in Europe\u2019s largest auto market declined about 13 percent last year to 1.34 million, the source said, declining to be identified ahead of publication of official sales data.  The country\u2019s KBA automotive watchdog is expected to publish official passenger-car registrations on Thursday.  German car sales fell about 1 percent in December to about 254,000 vehicles because of two fewer selling days than in the same month a year earlier, the source said, adding that private-sector registrations were up about 5 percent last month.  The drop in Germany mirrors declines in Italy and France where December sales fell 3.2 percent and 0.5 percent respectively. Registration of diesel cars in France fell below 50 percent last year for the first time since 2000, industry data released on Monday showed.

          "body": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel\u2019s parliament gave preliminary approval on Wednesday for legislation that would make it easier for a court to impose a death sentence on assailants convicted of murder in attacks classified as terrorism.  Israeli military courts - which handle cases involving Palestinians in the occupied West Bank - already have the power to issue the death sentence, although this has never been implemented. The only case of an execution in Israel was carried out against convicted Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1962.  The amendment to the penal code would still require three more readings if it is to become law. Currently, a death penalty can only be imposed if a panel of three military judges passes sentence unanimously. If the amendment is adopted, a majority verdict would suffice.  Wednesday\u2019s motion was brought by Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, an ultra-nationalist in the conservative coalition government, who advocates tough action against Palestinian militants. Fifty-two of parliament\u2019s 120 members voted in favor, and 49 were opposed.  Qadoura Fares, chairman of the Palestinian Prisoner Club which represents Palestinians jailed in Israel, denounced the vote as \u201can expression of the state of blindness and confusion in the policies of this fascist regime (where) extremist parties race to pass racist laws.  \u201cWhile the world moves toward repealing the death penalty, Israel is working to ratify this law, which is directed against the Palestinians,\u201d Fares told Reuters.      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voted for the motion but said that such legislation required deeper discussion and that the matter would now be considered at ministerial level before further debate in the Knesset.  In remarks to lawmakers, he said: \u201cI think that in extreme cases, when somebody slaughters and laughs (as he kills), he should not spend the rest of his time in jail and should be executed.\u201d  Asked by an Israeli Arab lawmaker whether he would also apply this reasoning to Jewish militants convicted of killing Palestinians, Netanyahu said: \u201cIn principle, yes.\u201d      The successful vote was the latest in a number of motions brought by right-wing coalition members who feel able to pressure Netanyahu\u2019s brittle government into enacting hard-line legislation.

Kotb will join Savannah Guthrie during the first two hours of the popular program, starting at 7 a.m. EST (noon GMT), and become the first pair of women to host the show along with weatherman Al Roker and Orange Room host Carson Daly.

At least two other women went to NBC with similar complaints against Lauer following the first allegation. None of the women has been publicly identified.  \u201cRepairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I\u2019m committed to beginning that effort,\u201d Lauer said after he was fired.

          "body": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italian gas grid company Snam has launched a 33 million euro ($40 million) tender to convert its car fleet to natural gas in a sign of its commitment to develop gas fuelling stations in the country.      The move comes as utilities across Europe race to embrace the fast-growing business of rolling out charging stations to meet carmaker pledges to move fleets to electric drives.     Snam, controlled by state lender CDP, said in a tender it had set a Feb. 16 deadline for bids from European companies to convert its 1,500 vehicle fleet to natural gas.      The supply contracts will be for three years, it said.       Europe\u2019s biggest gas pipeline operator has pledged to spend 150 million euros to build 300 new gas fuelling stations to beef up the country\u2019s existing 1,100 points.  Italy is the leading European market for natural gas-fuelled cars, with motorists guzzling more than 1 billion cubic meters in 2015 and about 1 million vehicles in circulation.  Snam CEO Marco Alvera told Reuters that by adding more stations the market could expand to 2-3 million vehicles and would be able to complement electric cars.  \u201cI drive a hybrid car, and I think the future will be gas and electricity - plug-in hybrids,\u201d he said.  Snam is looking to play a key role in helping develop new gas infrastructure and technology for Italy\u2019s transport sector including the use of liquefied natural gas to drive ships.  It has already inked deals with oil major Eni and leading petrol pump network API as well as carmaker Fiat Chrysler.

          "body": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italian gas grid company Snam has launched a 33 million euro ($40 million) tender to convert its car fleet to natural gas in a sign of its commitment to develop gas fuelling stations in the country.      The move comes as utilities across Europe race to embrace the fast-growing business of rolling out charging stations to meet carmaker pledges to move fleets to electric drives.     Snam, controlled by state lender CDP, said in a tender it had set a Feb. 16 deadline for bids from European companies to convert its 1,500 vehicle fleet to natural gas.      The supply contracts will be for three years, it said.       Europe\u2019s biggest gas pipeline operator has pledged to spend 150 million euros to build 300 new gas fuelling stations to beef up the country\u2019s existing 1,100 points.  Italy is the leading European market for natural gas-fuelled cars, with motorists guzzling more than 1 billion cubic meters in 2015 and about 1 million vehicles in circulation.  Snam CEO Marco Alvera told Reuters that by adding more stations the market could expand to 2-3 million vehicles and would be able to complement electric cars.  \u201cI drive a hybrid car, and I think the future will be gas and electricity - plug-in hybrids,\u201d he said.  Snam is looking to play a key role in helping develop new gas infrastructure and technology for Italy\u2019s transport sector including the use of liquefied natural gas to drive ships.  It has already inked deals with oil major Eni and leading petrol pump network API as well as carmaker Fiat Chrysler.  Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne is one of the few car bosses who has largely resisted the plug-in vogue, signing a deal with Eni in November to study new gas fuels to reduce carbon emissions.

          "body": "* New MiFID II financial rules take effect  * Most euro zone bond yields lower on day  * Ireland launches 10-year syndicated bond  * ECB\u2019s Nowotny says bond buying could end in 2018  * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates prices)  By Fanny Potkin  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Euro area borrowing costs edged lower on Wednesday, as a sweeping reform of EU financial market rules took effect a day after hawkish comments by ECB rate-setters triggered a sharp bond market sell-off.  Germany\u2019s 10-year government bond yield fell 2 basis points to 0.44 percent, off two-month highs hit on Tuesday after weekend comments from the European Central Bank\u2019s Benoit Coeure that there was a \u201creasonable chance\u201d ECB stimulus will not be extended this year.  It held near those highs in early trade after ECB rate setter Ewald Nowotny echoed those comments in a German newspaper, before heading down.  Analysts said that a significant bond redemption in Germany helped explain the fall in yields.  Most core euro zone bond yields were down 1-4 bps on the day, with the gap between Italian and German 10-year bonds yields tightened to 160 basis points as Italian yields dropped as much as 6 bps to 2.03 percent.  \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way down in prices and we had a redemption in Germany, so there many have been some cash being put back to work,\u201d said Orlando Green, European fixed income strategist at Credit Agricole.  Ireland meanwhile kicked off its annual funding drive by raising 4 billion euros with a syndicated 10-year bond, covering around a quarter of its issuance target just three days into the year.  European stock and bond volumes were generally light after major new securities regulations came into force, although traders said there was little in the way of serious disruption.  Under the new MiFID II - or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II - rules, trades in financial assets and instruments must all be logged in a repository, forcing banks, asset managers and traders to report detailed information on trillions of euros of transactions.  Fixed income volumes were lower at 1000 GMT compared to their average at that time over the previous 30 days, according to data provider Trax, a subsidiary of MarketAxess that tracks around 65 percent of all secondary market deals.  The new regulatory regime was delayed by a year due to its complexity, and regulators have had to issue eleventh-hour guidance to banks and financial firms to avoid trading freezes as well as calming the nerves of those not yet fully compliant.  Strategists said they expected investors to refrain from making large trades until they had a clearer sense of the impact of the reform.  Bond investors were also keeping a close eye on the U.S Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting minutes due later in the day.

          "body": "EDINBURGH (Reuters) - A polar bear cub has been born in Britain for the first time in 25 years, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland said on Wednesday.  Mother polar bear Victoria is believed to have given birth at the Highland Wildlife Park in northeastern Scotland after staff heard high pitched cries in late December.  \u201cWe first heard promising noises in the week before Christmas and these have now continued into the new year,\u201d said Una Richardson, the park\u2019s head keeper.  \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have sight inside her cubbing box we can\u2019t be sure if Victoria has had more than one cub but we can confirm the birth,\u201d she added.   Polar bears are known for their need for privacy and new- borns are extremely delicate, so the maternity den is closed to visitors at the zoo. The survival of the cub or cubs will not be fully confirmed until March, when bears emerge after winter.  The polar bear breeding season began in March last year, during which time Victoria mated with Arktos, one of the park\u2019s two males.  \u201cWhile we are absolutely thrilled, we are not celebrating prematurely as polar bear cubs have a high mortality rate in the first weeks of life due to their undeveloped immune system and the mother\u2019s exaggerated need for privacy, with any disturbance risking the cub being killed or abandoned,\u201d Richardson said.  Polar bears are born about 30 cm long and weigh roughly the same as a guinea pig. They emerge blind and do not open their eyes until they are about a month old, depending entirely on their mother\u2019s milk.  Reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; editing by Stephen Addison"

          "body": "ABUJA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Private equity-backed Viathan Group has issued Nigeria\u2019s debut 10-year corporate infrastructure bond in local currency to raise 10 billion naira ($32 million) at a yield of 16 percent to fund power assets.  Viathan, owned by Synergy Private Equity, develops and operates off-grid power solutions in Nigeria. It issued the bond backed by InfraCredit, a triple A rated credit facility set up by Nigeria\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and GuarantCo.  Synergy has committed capital of over $100 million and has invested in 10 companies in Nigeria and Ghana, it said. Viathan provides power solution for government, household and businesses in Nigeria, using natural gas as fuel.  The bond issue stretches the yield curve for corporates in Nigeria to 10-years, extending maturity for businesses in a country dominated by short-term bank loans. High interest rates have dogged new corporate issues for years.  Viathan plans to use the proceeds to refinance existing short-term bank loans, expand its generation capacity by 7.5 megawatts (MW), and build a compressed natural gas plant.  Nigeria needs an estimated 160,000 MW of electricity to meet local demand. However, it only has capacity of 12,132 MW, of which just around 7,000 is operational.  Twelve pension funds and two insurance firms bought the Viathan bond which was priced at a premium of 82 basis point to the 10-year sovereign benchmark bond through a book building.

          "body": "* Graphic: sterling and gilt yields bit.ly/2dgAXn1  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv (Adds new quote, adds details, updates prices)  By Tommy Wilkes and Jemima Kelly  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Sterling slipped from a three-month high above $1.36 on Wednesday, with currency traders cautious about pushing the pound too far without any new catalysts.  The pound had earlier reached as high as $1.3614, its strongest since Sept. 20 and less than half a cent away from the September peak of $1.3659, its strongest since the referendum on European Union membership in June 2016.  But having appeared unruffled by a survey showing growth in Britain\u2019s construction sector slowed last month, sterling weakened during the day as the dollar climbed broadly, at once point dipping below $1.35, down 0.7 percent on the day.  The pound last year recorded its best annual performance against the dollar since 2009, with an almost 10 percent rise amid broad dollar weakness. But it is still around 10 percent down against the dollar since the vote for Brexit.  Investors say that despite some progress in Brexit talks towards the end of last year, sterling needs stronger signs that Britain will get a transition deal and a favourable trade deal with the EU before it can climb further.  \u201cSterling is lacking any major catalyst in any direction,\u201d said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re gravitating close to that high around $1.36, you need a meaningful sterling catalyst to break that. We do see that happening over the next few months, but not necessarily any time soon,\u201d he added.  Against the euro, sterling was 0.2 percent down at 88.92 pence.  Earlier, the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI slipped to 52.2 after hitting a five-month high of 53.1 in November, the first slowdown in growth since September.  The PMI came in just below a median forecast of 52.5 in a Reuters poll of economists.  Lee Hardman, a London-based currency analyst at MUFG, said the PMI data had little impact on the bigger picture of the economic growth outlook for the UK.  \u201cWe are focusing on Brexit negotiations. We will be looking for signs of progress,\u201d Hardman said.  \u201cWe think there is a lot of pessimism priced into the pound,\u201d he said, predicting a move higher to $1.40 this year.  The PMI for Britain\u2019s dominant services sector is due to be released on Thursday.  Reporting by Tommy Wilkes and Jemima Kelly; Editing by Jeremy\nGaunt and Keith Weir"

          "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Much of the stock market\u2019s recent boom resided in an acronym: FAANG, for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, aka Alphabet. As important as they\u2019ve become, investors tired of this trade can look forward in 2018 to a new set of letters to jumble into a more exciting investment thesis. Call it SLAW.  Four of the most highly valued private companies - Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork \u2013 are in various stages of preparing to go public. Although none may ever match the scale of a FAANG or a BAT \u2013 as China\u2019s Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are known \u2013 they\u2019re uniquely disruptive enterprises whose success, or failure, may determine the future of cities, mobility, work and fun.  The FAANG components altered the internet, retailing, communications and entertainment businesses. It\u2019s hard to imagine the next debutantes blossoming into $900 billion Apples, but they operate in areas offering extraordinary potential to snatch market share from incumbents and stimulate new demand for their products.  Take Lyft. Though second in the United States to Uber in ride hailing, an initial public offering would make it the first pure play for public investors on a future where transportation is sold as a service, not as an automobile. That potential has lured investors, including Google and General Motors, into giving it a $10 billion valuation.  Similarly, Airbnb has snagged a $31 billion valuation as the leading home-rental app. Founder Brian Chesky says he\u2019s taking a \u201cget rich slow\u201d approach, but will be ready for an IPO in 2018. That would offer a way to bet on the emerging model for the lodging industry.  What Chesky is doing to hotels, Adam Neumann is doing to office space with WeWork. While it sounds grand to suggest Neumann\u2019s company is redefining the future of work, it was credible enough for SoftBank to shell out $4.4 billion, valuing WeWork at some $20 billion.  Then there\u2019s Spotify, which has upended the music industry with its streaming service. As if that\u2019s not unruly enough, founder Daniel Ek plans to list Spotify\u2019s shares without an IPO, potentially upsetting Wall Street\u2019s lucrative underwriting cartel.  These firms could choose to remain in private hands for another few years. But with investors hankering for ways to capitalize on changes to the way we work, play and travel, the ingredients to make a perfect SLAW will come together nicely in 2018.

          "body": "(Adds background on case)  By Brendan Pierson  NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Jurors in the U.S. trial of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank who is charged with helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions, asked in a note on Wednesday what they should do if they agree on some of the charges against Atilla but not others.  Atilla is charged with bank fraud, money laundering and four separate conspiracy charges. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said he would tell the jury in response to the note that they should continue deliberating and try to reach a verdict.  Wednesday was the jury\u2019s fourth day deliberating on the case, which has strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey.  At the center of the three-week trial was testimony from Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions and testified for U.S. prosecutors.  Zarrab testified that Atilla helped design fraudulent transactions of gold and food that allowed Iran to spend its oil and gas revenues abroad, including through U.S. financial institutions, defying U.S. sanctions.  Zarrab also implicated Turkish officials in the scheme, including President Tayyip Erdogan.  Attempts to reach Erdogan\u2019s spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful. Erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government.  Atilla has denied all of the charges against him.  Halkbank has denied taking part in any illegal transactions.  U.S. prosecutors charged nine people in the criminal case, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, were arrested by U.S. authorities.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Freezing weather across the U.S East Coast has drawn a number of tankers carrying diesel and heating oil from Europe, reversing a traditional trade route.  The Pacific Anna set sale this week from the Gibraltar straits to the storage hub of St Croix in the Caribbean with a 90,000 tonne cargo of diesel it had loaded in Saudi Arabia in December, according to Reuters AIS ship tracking.  Similarly, trading house Vitol chartered the 60,000 ton Amalia to deliver diesel from the Baltic port of Primorsk to St Croix, where it is expected to discharge on Jan. 15, according to shipping data and tracking.  \u201cThe cold weather is drawing barrels,\u201d a European diesel trader said.  Oil products stored at St Croix are typically sold into the United States, traders said. The cargo might be blended with other components to meet the U.S. winter specifications for heating oil, they added.  A third cargo, STI Donald C Traus has also been booked by Gazprom from Primorsk with options to go on the transatlantic route.  The United States has in recent years become a major exporter of refined oil products, supplying large volumes of diesel to Europe, where regional refineries can not meet local demand.  But an Arctic front that hit eastern United States has led to a sharp rise in demand for diesel, used in many states for heating, offering traders what is known as a reverse arbitrage.   Another major winter storm is set to hit the region on Wednesday with freezing rain, snow and strong winds, demand was expected.  Several other traders are seeking to deliver cargoes on the west-bound transatlantic route, traders said.   Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy estimated demand for heating oil in the United States will rise by 90,000 barrels per day in January and February compared to a year earlier.

          "body": "INNSBRUCK, Austria (Reuters) - Olympic gold medalist and two-time world champion Bode Miller has told Reuters that Mikaela Shiffrin is the best alpine ski racer he has ever seen and that she could win a slew of medals for the U.S. at the upcoming Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.   Shiffrin, who won gold in the slalom at the Sochi Olympics in 2014, is currently top of the overall World Cup standings after racking up a series of good results so far this season.  Miller, the most decorated U.S. Olympic skier with six medals, believed that the 22-year-old could even equal his record tally next month at the Games in South Korea.   \u201cI think she\u2019s maybe the best ski racer I\u2019ve ever seen, male or female. She\u2019s so balanced, dynamic, intense and focused, so for me, I think she\u2019s got a chance in any event she skis in,\u201d the 40-year-old said.   \u201cI would say it\u2019s likely she wins two (Olympic) golds, I would say an outside shot at five medals, and I think probably, at her best, maybe three or four of them are golds,\u201d he added.  Miller, who retired last November after 20 years in ski racing, is looking forward to embracing technology as part of his role at Eurosport covering the Games to help viewers gain a better understanding of Alpine skiing.  \u201cI\u2019m going to try to bring knowledge to people, so that I can educate them and make watching the sport more fun and more exciting,\u201d Miller said.   Part of his brief is to use the Eurosport Cube, a studio incorporating augmented reality and enhanced data, to explain the technical details to look out for in the various disciplines.  \u201cIf it was just verbal, if I was on the radio I couldn\u2019t explain anything, but then television brings it to the next level, where people can see what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d he added.  Miller also said that media work was not something he had planned for in his retirement.   \u201cThis is more of an experiment. I\u2019ve made a really strong effort of the last six years or seven years to stay in the sport because I love it, and because I think it needs people who love it to make it exciting and make it fun for people to watch.  \u201cIf I can help and it works and it\u2019s good, and I can make the athletes be inspired and ski harder and take more risks, and make it better for the people at home to watch, then maybe I\u2019ll stay in it,\u201d he said.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - American Mikaela Shiffrin relishes the opportunity to be a multiple-medal threat at the Olympics in Pyeongchang next month and is brimming with confidence after a dominant run through World Cup events in the lead up to the Games.  The 22-year-old Alpine ski racer heads to her second Olympic Games oozing with confidence after notching 37 World Cup wins, including the first ever in downhill late last year which stunned the skiing world.   Her torrid pace at World Cup events puts her on track to top Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark\u2019s all-time record of 86 wins.   But the slalom specialist will soon be ready to shift her focus from racking up World Cup wins to claiming medals on the sport\u2019s biggest stage.  In a statement that should strike fear into the hearts of her competitors, she told Reuters that she was a better skiier now than she was when the then 18-year-old from Colorado won gold in slalom in Sochi, becoming the youngest women\u2019s slalom champion in Olympic history.  \u201cBeing four years older I feel like I have more experience and knowledge under my belt,\u201d she said.  \u201cBut especially since I have improved my skiing a lot since Sochi and I have had more success in events other than slalom, I feel like I\u2019m going into Pyeongchang with the unique opportunity to be a multiple event medal threat, which is super cool.\u201d  Despite her success in downhill, where she earned her maiden World Cup victory in the discipline at Canada\u2019s Lake Louise in early December, she is resisting the urge to stretch herself too thin in South Korea.  \u201cRight now I am planning slalom, giant slalom, Alpine combined, and Super-G,\u201d she said.   \u201cBut that is tentative and always subject to change,\u201d she said, adding that she will finalize her program closer to the Games.   Tom Kelly, vice president of communications at U.S. Ski & Snowboard, reckoned what separated Shiffrin from the rest of the field was her complete devotion to the sport.  \u201cShe is an amazing human being,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cShe is a very unique individual and the passion that she has for this sport is really unmatched.\u201d   Shiffrin\u2019s confidence also comes from knowing that her tight-knit family, which includes her ski racing parents Eileen and Jeff, will have her back no matter how she performs in Pyeongchang.  \u201cI think there are huge advantages of having such a close and supportive family,\u201d she said.   \u201cFirst and foremost the fact that I know they are always looking out for my best interest and even if I come up short of my goals they will love me anyway.\u201d   The Olympics will run from Feb. 9 to Feb. 25.

The wind derailed the lead car on the Montreux-Bernese Oberland (MOB) regional train around midday near Lenk in central Switzerland, an MOB spokesman said.  \u201cI have never seen anything like it,\u201d he added.  Gusts on the Pilatus peak near Lucerne hit 195 kph (122 mph), the highest there since records began in 1981, broadcaster SRF reported.  The Swiss weather service issued strong gale warnings for much of the country. Many roads were closed, passenger ferry traffic was halted in some areas and several air flights were canceled.  Media websites featured pictures and video of the havoc: a  light airplane was overturned in Stans, wind tore scaffolding from a construction site near Lucerne, and tractor-trailers were blown onto their sides on some major motorways.  Several people were stranded on a ski lift in St Gallen canton when trees toppled onto the gondola lines, police said.  In the capital Bern, the Christmas tree on display at the main railway station snapped at mid-morning, but no one was injured by the 13-metre high trunk that weighs 2.4 tonnes, Swiss broadcaster RTS said, showing a photo of it on the pavement.  In the Netherlands, a storm disrupted air travel at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport, Europe\u2019s third busiest.  More than a fifth of the originally planned 1,200 incoming and outgoing flights were canceled as wind gusts reached speeds of up to 120 kph (75 mph).   Storms also prompted authorities to close all five major sea barriers to prevent flooding in the lowlands.  In France, a skier was killed when a tree fell on him on a ski slope and at least 15 others were injured in storms in northern and eastern regions that cut power to some 225,000 homes, local authorities said.  Households in the Normandy region were the worst hit by storm Eleanor, Enedis, a unit of state-controlled EDF said, while the area around Paris and northeastern Picardie and Champagne-Ardenne were also among those affected.   The latest weather warning and strong winds come after winter storm Carmen battered western France on New Year\u2019s day, with some 40,000 households in the Brittany region temporarily losing power.   Homes and businesses on Ireland\u2019s west coast suffered flood damage and 27,000 were left without electricity on Wednesday when Eleanor brought heavy rain and winds of up to 155 kph (96 mph) per hour, hitting the fourth largest city, Galway, particularly hard.

          "body": "RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinians condemned as blackmail on Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to withhold future aid payments over what he called the Palestinians\u2019 unwillingness to talk peace with Israel.  Trump drew praise from a cabinet minister in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing government but a warning from a former Israeli peace negotiator of the dangers in cutting off financial assistance to the Palestinians.  On Twitter on Tuesday, Trump said that Washington gives Palestinians \u201cHUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don\u2019t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?\u201d  Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s executive committee, said in response: \u201cWe will not be blackmailed.\u201d  Palestinian anger at Trump is already high over his Dec. 6 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a declaration that also generated outrage across the Arab world and concern among Washington\u2019s Western allies.  Commenting on Trump\u2019s tweets, Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said: \u201cJerusalem is not for sale, neither for gold nor for silver.\u201d  Abu Rdainah said the Palestinians were not opposed to returning to peace talks that collapsed in 2014, but only on the basis of establishing a state of their own along the lines that existed before Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 war.  \u201cIf the United States is keen about peace and about its interests it must abide by that,\u201d he said.  Israel, which withdrew troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, has called the pre-1967 war West Bank boundaries indefensible and has pledged to hold on to all of Jerusalem forever.  A report prepared for the U.S. Congress in December 2016 by the U.S. Congressional Research Service said annual U.S. economic support to the West Bank and Gaza Strip has averaged around $400 million since fiscal 2008.  Much of the money has gone toward U.S. Agency for International Development-administered project assistance and the rest toward budget support for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which administers limited self-rule in the Palestinian territories under interim peace agreements.  Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev, a member of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, welcomed Trump\u2019s aid comments, saying on Army Radio: \u201cI am very satisfied ... (Trump) is saying the time has come to stop saying flattering words (to the Palestinians).\u201d  But Tzipi Livni, an Israeli opposition politician and a former peace negotiator, said \u201ca responsible and serious (Israeli) government\u201d should quietly tell Trump that it would be in Israel\u2019s interest to prevent a \u201chumanitarian crisis in Gaza\u201d and to continue to fund Palestinian security forces cooperating with Israel.  Earlier on Tuesday, Trump\u2019s U.N. ambassador disclosed plans to stop funding a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees.  \u201cThe president has basically said he doesn\u2019t want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table,\u201d Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters when asked about future U.S. funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)for Palestinian refugees.  In an emailed statement, UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said \u201cUNRWA has not been informed by the United States administration of any changes in U.S. funding to the Agency\u201d.  The United States is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA\u2019s website.  According to UNRWA\u2019s website, there are 5.9 million UNRWA refugees and other registered persons eligible for its services, which include education and health care, in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: The Basque Provinces: Institutional Transfers to be Considered as Pass-Through Revenue here BARCELONA, January 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings says in a new report that the share of tax collected by the Historical Territories (the Basque Provinces) and ultimately destined for other administrations - often referred to as institutional transfers - will be viewed as a pass-through. Previously, Fitch was showing in its reports the entire amount of tax collected, while in its analysis of the Historical Territories' fiscal performance, Fitch was excluding those institutional transfers. Therefore, this new accounting consideration, by itself, has no impact on the ratings of the three Historical Territories as there is no change to our fiscal assessment. The main reason Fitch did not exclude those institutional transfers in its reports was partly because the precise amounts were not known previously. Unlike in the 15 regions under the common regime, the tax model in the Basque public sector is different from the rest of Spain, and notably the bulk of the taxes are collected by the three Basque Provinces. These are mainly personal income tax, value added tax and corporate tax, altogether amounting to around EUR13 billion in 2016, and represented about 18% of regional GDP. Besides tax collection, the Basque Provinces are also responsible for tax regulation and inspection. Tax agreements under the Basque Provinces are required to be reviewed every three to five years but in practice have seen little material changes since their introduction in the 1980s. Around 85% of the basket of taxes collected by the provinces are transferred to the state, regions and municipalities. The report, 'The Basque Province: Institutional Transfers to be Considered as Pass-Through Revenue', is available via the link above.

The country\u2019s biggest union is demanding a 6 percent wage rise this year for about 3.9 million workers in the metal and engineering sectors, including the German car industry.  It is entitled to stage walkouts after a non-strike period ended on Sunday and many workers usually respond to its calls for action.  The union, which also wants a shorter working week, plans to expand stoppages across Germany from next Monday to step up pressure on employers before the next round of pay negotiations, due on Jan. 11.  Employers have dismissed the pay claim as excessive and have so far offered only a 2 percent raise as well as a 200 euro ($240.50) one-off payment in the first quarter.  Porsche, the second-biggest contributor to Volkswagen (VW) group profit, assembles the 911 and Boxster models at its core factory in Zuffenhausen where the so-called warning strikes have been called.  \u201cThe current stance of the employers\u2019 lobby is a provocation to workers,\u201d Porsche works council chief Uwe Hueck said in an emailed statement.  \u201cThe metal and engineering industry has never before made so much profit. That\u2019s why there is only one appropriate response: Warning strikes.\u201d  A spokesman for the Suedwestmetall employers lobby did not return calls seeking comment.  Several hundred workers at companies including auto components supplier Robert Bosch laid down their tools on Tuesday in support of IG Metall\u2019s calls for higher wages.

          "body": "* To sell stakes in airline  * Also selling sates in power utility, railways operator  * Raising money to cut budget deficit (Adds details)  By Alfonce Mbizwo  HARARE, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe has invited bids for stakes in up to eight loss-making state-owned enterprises, including its national airline and power utility, to help plug a ballooning budget deficit, its deputy finance minister said on Wednesday.  President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over from Robert Mugabe two months ago, is under pressure to deliver on his promises to ease spending pressures on the budget and revitalise the economy, which collapsed especially after violent and chaotic seizures of white-owned commercial farms in early 2000s.  Zimbabwe\u2019s budget deficit hit $1.82 billion or 11.2 percent of GDP in 2017 from an initial target of $400 million, while its economy hardly grew in 2016.  Over the last four years, Zimbabwe has failed to cut its deficit despite promises to do so, mainly due to high government spending on public sector salaries, which accounted for more than 90 percent of the 2016 budget.  \u201cWe are diluting our shareholding in those entities and our shareholding might go to zero percent in some entities,\u201d Terence Mukupe told Reuters.  Zimbabwe either partly or wholly owns 92 companies, most of which have been making losses for years due to mismanagement, high operating costs and old equipment. In 2016, 38 such parastatals ran losses totalling $270 million, according to a report from the president and cabinet office last October.  National airline Air Zimbabwe, which runs four aircraft, is sitting on a more than $300 million debt pile while railway operator National Railways of Zimbabwe recently received a $400 million recapitulation from South Africa\u2019s Transnet.  Power utility Zesa Holdings has struggled since 2000 to generate enough electricity to meet demand and power outages have hurt businesses in recent years, according to the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI).  In 2016, Zesa suffered a $224 million loss due to higher electricity import costs and because it is selling power at below cost.  Zimbabwe is also selling off its shareholdings in several other companies, including bankers, ZB Holdings and Agribank as well as insurer, Zimre Holdings, which has operations in several regional countries.

          "body": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy\u2019s rightist Northern League brushed off on Wednesday suggestions it had dropped its opposition to the euro and renewed its pledge to rectify the \u201cerror\u201d of the single currency.  Rising hostility to the euro in Italy is a prominent issue in campaigning for a March national election, and the prospect that anti-establishment parties could try to pull the country out of the single currency has rattled financial markets.  A coalition including the League and former premier Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) looks set to win the most votes in March, but no group is likely to achieve a clear parliamentary majority.  European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, a member of Forza Italia, said this week the League \u201cseemed to have abandoned the idea of a hypothetical and unfeasible exit from the euro\u201d. League leader Matteo Salvini hit back on Wednesday.  \u201cFree interpretations of my thinking make me laugh,\u201d he told la Repubblica newspaper. \u201cI remain convinced ... that the euro under these conditions was an error. Which we will put right.\u201d  Allied with France\u2019s National Front in the European Parliament, the League blames the euro for rising poverty in the bloc, saying it only favors economic powerhouse Germany.  Once one of the most pro-EU nations in Europe, Italy has become more hostile towards Brussels in recent years. A survey released by the Bertelsmann Foundation last October showed 83 percent of Italians were not satisfied with the direction of the EU against an average of 66 percent across the 28-nation bloc.     The anti-system 5-Star Movement has also seized on this disaffection, pledging a referendum on euro membership if Brussels does not agree to change the bloc\u2019s fiscal rules. [nL8N1OI4XS]  But in France, the National Front\u2019s anti-euro stance contributed to a bruising defeat at the hands of pro-EU centrist Emanuel Macron last spring. Marine Le Pen\u2019s party has since softened its position, leaving the Northern League more isolated within Europe in its push for a euro-exit. [nL8N1MM3VG]   \u201cBefore, we had a concrete hope of creating a group of nations that could have immediately demolished the euro ... Sadly we no longer have that, so we need to approach it unilaterally,\u201d Claudio Borghi Aquilini, the League\u2019s head of economic policy, told Reuters.   \u201cOur plan is still to try to leave the euro as soon as possible, but \u2018as soon as possible\u2019 means being ready to do so,\u201d he said, giving no indication of how long it would take.  One of the League\u2019s flagship proposals is to introduce a parallel currency for domestic use, issuing small-denomination bonds to firms and individuals owed money by the state.   Borghi said such instruments could become a sovereign currency in an emergency.  Berlusconi, who cannot run personally in the election because of a tax fraud conviction, also proposes a dual currency, but does not back abandoning the euro. [nL8N1LP4E9]  Building consensus in a center-right coalition for a radical exit will be difficult, Borghi said, partly because Italy\u2019s economy is now growing modestly. But any future intransigence from European authorities could help that cause, he added.  \u201cIf we start with the idea that we always have to say \u2018yes\u2019 to whatever they ask of us, because we must stay in the euro at all costs, it\u2019s over, it\u2019s worse than a military defeat,\u201d he said.

The defect affects the so-called kernel memory on Intel processor chips manufactured over the past decade, The Register reported, citing unnamed programmers, and the flaw allows users of normal applications to discern the layout or content of protected areas on the chips.  That could make it possible for hackers to exploit other security bugs or, worse, expose secure information such as passwords, thus compromising individual computers or even entire server networks.  Intel and Microsoft did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment sent during European working hours.  Shares in Intel fell by more than 3 percent in pre-market trading following the report.  The Register said programmers for the Linux open-source operating system were working to overhaul the affected memory areas, while Microsoft Corp was expected to issue a Windows patch next Tuesday after circulating test fixes towards the end of 2017.  \"Crucially, these updates to both Linux and Windows will incur a performance hit on Intel products,\" The Register wrote (bit.ly/2CsRxkj).  \u201cThe effects are being benchmarked, however we are looking at a ballpark figure of a five to 30 percent slowdown, depending on the task and the processor model.\u201d  Competing chip maker AMD has told Linux developers by email that its chips are not vulnerable to the types of attacks that the fix for the Intel chip is intended to address by isolating the kernel memory, The Register said.  Shares in AMD jumped more than 7 percent in premarket trade after The Register report on Intel.  Further, the bug is likely to affect major cloud computing platforms such as Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure and Google Compute Engine, according to one software blogger cited by The Register.  Microsoft Azure is due to undergo a maintenance reboot on Jan. 10 while Amazon Web Services has also advised customers via email to expect a major security update this Friday.  The Register also said that similar operating systems, such as Apple\u2019s 64-bit macOS operating system, would need to be updated.

          "body": "DETROIT, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Major automakers on Wednesday reported mixed U.S. sales figures for December, helped in part by large consumer discounts aimed at moving vehicles off dealer lots by the end of the year.  December capped another strong year for U.S. new vehicle sales, with final 2017 figures - which are yet to be in - set to be just shy of the record 17.55 million units sold in 2016.  Throughout 2017, automakers benefited from a continuing consumer shift away from passenger cars to more profitable pickup trucks and SUVs.  Industry observers expect sales to edge lower in 2018 after a long bull run, thanks to a saturated market and rising interest rates, which will lead to increased monthly payments for consumers and reduce their purchasing power.  Consumer discounts also remain a concern moving forward. Discounts in excess of 10 percent of a vehicle\u2019s sticker price are considered unhealthy for resale values and in December, auto consultancies J.D. Power and LMC estimated discounts had surpassed 10 percent for the 17th time in the last 18 months.  General Motors Co reported a 3.3 percent drop in sales in December, driven by a decline in lower-margin fleet sales to government agencies and rental car companies. The company\u2019s retail sales were up 1.8 percent in December.  For the full year, GM\u2019s sales were down 1.3 percent. The automaker said its average transaction price hit $35,400, above the industry average of $31,600.  The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects industry-wide U.S. new vehicle sales in 2018 \u201cin the high 16 million-unit range.\u201d  \u201cThis year, many consumers will see their take-home pay rise because of tax reform,\u201d GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem said in a statement. \u201cThat will keep the broad economy growing, and help keep sales at very healthy levels even as the Fed increases interest rates.\u201d  Ford Motor Co reported a 0.9 percent increase in sales for December, fueled by a 17 percent increase in fleet sales.  The No. 2 U.S. automaker said retail sales were down 4 percent and that lucrative pickup truck sales were 1 percent lower than in December 2016.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) posted an 11 percent sales decrease for the month, with retail sales dropping 3 percent. Fleet sales slumped 42 percent, in line with a company strategy over the last year to cut back on this low-margin way to offload product.  In morning trading, GM shares were up 2.4 percent, Ford shares were up 0.6 percent and Fiat Chrysler was up 0.5 percent.  Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Bernadette Baum"

          "body": "(Reuters) - Elise Mertens fended off Daria Gavrilova while David Goffin blitzed his way past Thanasi Kokkinakis as Belgium secured a 3-0 victory over Australia in the Hopman Cup on Wednesday.  Mertens fought back from a set down to outlast Gavrilova 2-6 6-4 6-2 in a two-hour battle at the Perth Arena to help Belgium keep their hopes of reaching Saturday\u2019s final alive.  Gavrilova broke Mertens early in the match and clinched the opening set with ease. She continued to attack her rival in the second set but world number 36 Mertens saved a break point and changed her gameplan to counter the Australian.  \u201cI started to be more aggressive, stepped up to the baseline and came to the net more,\u201d Mertens said. \u201cI made her play more defensive, so I\u2019m happy with my game in the end.  \u201cI\u2019ve worked a lot on my offence. Tennis at the top is so aggressive, so direct, that\u2019s the style I want to play.\u201d  Mertens reeled off three games in a row to level the contest at one set all and used the momentum to prevail in the decider.  Goffin, who beat world number four Alexander Zverev in his opening match, struck 27 winners in his 6-4 6-2 victory over Kokkinakis to clinch the tie. Belgium then won the mixed doubles dead rubber.  \u201cI\u2019m feeling so well on the court since I arrived here in Australia,\u201d Goffin said. \u201cI\u2019m playing really well, I\u2019ve won two good matches with a high level, so I\u2019m very happy how I\u2019ve started the year.\u201d  Belgium can reach the final if they beat Canada in their next match and Australia fail to better their result against Germany.  Earlier, Angelique Kerber beat Eugenie Bouchard 6-1 6-3 while Alexander Zverev defeated Vasek Pospisil 6-4 6-2 as Germany sealed a comfortable 3-0 victory over Canada.

          "title": "Ethiopia to free jailed politicians to 'foster national reconciliation': PM",
          "body": "ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia will release and pardon dissident politicians jailed on criminal charges, its prime minister said on Wednesday \u2014 an unexpected shift in stance from a government routinely accused by rights groups of using security concerns to stifle dissent.  Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, whose administration denies crushing peaceful opposition, said the move was intended to \u201cfoster national reconciliation\u201d.   It follows recent protests over land rights and repression and ethnic clashes, and takes place amid a political crisis that has seen some senior officials submit resignations from the ruling party.  \u201cPoliticians currently under prosecution and those previously sentenced will either have their cases annulled or be pardoned,\u201d Hailemariam told domestic news outlets in the capital. He did not give further details.      The Horn of Africa country has been wracked by violence for almost three years, with protests first breaking out in its Oromiya province over allegations of land grabs.  Several dissident politicians have since been jailed having been charged with involvement in terrorism and collusion with the secessionist Oromo Liberation Front, which the government has branded a terrorist group.  Nearly 700 people died in one bout of unrest during months of protests in 2015 and 2016, according to a parliament-mandated investigation.  Rallies over land rights then broadened into demonstrations over political restrictions and perceived rights abuses, including the incarceration of Merera Gudina and Bekele Gerba \u2014 leaders of the opposition group the Oromo Federalist Congress.  Rights group Amnesty International said the decision could signal the \u201cend of an era of bloody repression\u201d.  \u201cA new chapter for human rights will only be possible if all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment are effectively investigated and those responsible brought to justice,\u201d Fisseha Tekle, its researcher on Ethiopia, said in a statement.  In recent months, a spate of ethnic clashes have also taken place. Dozens of people were killed in several bouts of violence between ethnic Oromos and Somalis in the Oromiya region last year.  Hailemariam made his announcement after the ruling EPRDF coalition concluded a weeks-long meeting meant to thrash out policies to address grievances.  The unrest had triggered growing friction within the party. Two high-ranking members subsequently submitted their resignation, while officials have openly squabbled with each other over the cause of clashes.  Ethiopia, sandwiched between volatile Somalia and Sudan, is often accused by rights groups of regularly using security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent and media freedoms. It denies the charge.  Its 547-seat parliament does not have a single opposition politician in it, and opposition groups accuse the government of constant harassment and intimidation.  The government in Addis Ababa has been denying imposing political restrictions.  Hailemariam said a detention facility known as \u201cMakelawi\u201d, where rights groups have alleged that torture has taken place, would also be closed down and turned into a museum.

          "body": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Kenyan online sports betting firm has canceled 600 million shillings ($5.80 million) in direct annual sponsorship for the country\u2019s main football league and other sports, after the government hiked taxes for such firms by more than four times.  The government increased the tax rate on gross profits for sports betting firms, lotteries and casinos to 35 percent last year, from 7.5 percent, to create a fund for sports, culture and the arts. It says the rapid growth of betting in a loosely regulated environment has hurt the young and vulnerable.  Ronald Karauri, the chief executive of Sportpesa, one of the biggest firms, said they were left with no choice but to cut costs in order to survive.   \u201cAll we will have to do is manage our expenditure in terms of our marketing expenses,\u201d he told Reuters on Wednesday.    \u201cWe had really committed ourselves to sports in the country so it is a very huge burden for us as a cost.\u201d   Sportpesa has been sponsoring the Kenyan football federation, the country\u2019s premier league, various clubs including last year\u2019s league champions Gor Mahia, the national rugby union and boxing.  Ambrose Rachier, the chairman of Gor Mahia, said the club might be forced to pull out of this year\u2019s Confederation Champions League Cup, a regional competition, due to lack of funds. The team was getting 60 million shillings a year from Sportpesa.  \u201cIt is devastating ... We are in mourning,\u201d Rachier said.  The situation was the same at the Kenya Rugby Union, which is losing 120 million shillings a year, used to prepare squads for the international rugby sevens series.   It was also using the cash to pay training and match allowances to its 15-a-side teams, said Richard Omwela, the chairman of the rugby union.  \u201cIt is a total shutdown,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless the government steps in and says we will underwrite that, what we possibly will do is tell our suppliers and partners that we can\u2019t meet our obligations.\u201d    Kenyan sports teams have long been beset by poor management and corruption, which have hindered their performance abroad and discouraged fans at home.  In 2016, sports officials were investigated after the team to that year\u2019s Olympic games in Brazil complained of mismanagement of flight and hotel bookings, theft of kits and even the mishandling of the list of accredited participants.    Despite problems in the build up to Rio, the East African nation enjoyed its most successful Olympics, winning six gold medals, six silvers and one bronze, all in track and field.

          "title": "Breakingviews - Hadas: Albanian mania is cautionary crypto tale",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bitcoin\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0hot topic at this year\u2019s seasonal parties. Financially ignorant people\u00a0asked\u00a0what is going on. The most authoritative answers often came from\u00a0those with\u00a0little\u00a0previous interest in investment. It is a familiar pattern.  In\u00a0financial\u00a0bubbles, the end is likely near when amateurs become experts. As speculator Bernard Baruch reminisced about the late 1920s: \u201cAn old beggar who regularly patrolled the street in front of my office now gave me tips and, I suppose, spent the money I and others gave him in the market.\u201d  In one important way, though, this time is different. While the stock market was undoubtedly overvalued before the 1929 crash, almost all the companies were quite profitable. In contrast,\u00a0there is little of substance\u00a0supporting\u00a0electronic tokens such as bitcoin.  All right, there is a story. In some future time, government-backed currencies will be discredited, but computer networks will still be standing strong. Then people who are desperate for sound money will turn to the software elixir of monetary security, the self-regulating blockchain. Bitcoin and other tokens based on this wondrous technology will\u00a0be\u00a0immensely valuable, so much so that no current price is too high.  After three decades of global disinflation with almost no consumer losses on bank deposits, that story is nonsensical. Even counting the appeal of anonymous crypto-transactions to criminals, this may well be the weakest justification for an investment\u00a0craze\u00a0since the Albanian bubble of 1996.  In that year the Balkan state was swept up in a mania for \u201cinvestment funds\u201d. These were actually classic Ponzi schemes. They promised extravagant returns of up to 30 percent a month, and could keep going as long as they collected enough new cash to repay the few who wanted to sell out.  The growth was dramatic. Over a few months, the funds sucked in the equivalent of almost half of the nation\u2019s\u00a0gross domestic product, according to an International Monetary Fund study published in 2000. People sold houses and slaughtered their herds to\u00a0raise funds\u00a0to invest.  It all unravelled in early 1997, creating a popular uproar. The government fell, armouries were looted and fighting broke out. The IMF estimates that 2,000 people died. A new government restored civil and monetary order, but Albania\u2019s GDP fell 11 percent in 1997, and\u00a0did not recover fully for five years.\u00a0The compound annual GDP growth rate for the previous five years\u00a0did not return\u00a0to the pre-mania level of 5 percent\u00a0until 2001.  Albanian fund buyers were certainly greedy and foolish. Still, after\u00a040 years of isolationist Communist rule,\u00a0residents could\u00a0be forgiven for not understanding\u00a0how financial markets work. Besides, the post-Communist government did nothing to dispel popular illusions during those manic months.  Buyers of bitcoin and its peers have more to be ashamed of. They are certainly not desperately poor, and\u00a0any ignorance is wilful. The key\u00a0drawback of\u00a0crypto-currencies \u2013\u00a0that they\u00a0lack any legal\u00a0function\u00a0\u2013 is\u00a0glaringly obvious. With a little more digging, potential buyers could also see this market is like a Ponzi promoter\u2019s dream. Almost nobody\u00a0sells, and new buyers do not care about the price.  Bitcoin\u2019s rise in 2017 \u2013 its value increased by the equivalent of 24 percent a month \u2013 has overpowered such concerns. Like the Albanians before them, crypto-currency speculators\u00a0have\u00a0responded\u00a0to signals of future wealth with a blind, instinctual frenzy. Technically\u00a0they\u00a0remain rational creatures, but greed has overcome their judgement.  There are two differences between Albania then and crypto-world now. First, the current frenzy has stimulated the creation of a complex trading infrastructure with a speed and sophistication that the hucksters of Tirana could hardly have imagined.\u00a0Newly minted\u00a0financial\u00a0experts can\u00a0dabble in\u00a0futures contracts,\u00a0while drawing on\u00a0dedicated websites, technical analysts and a burgeoning public relations industry.  Second and more happily, the crypto-collapse is set to be much less\u00a0damaging. The current market capitalisation of the leading 30 pretend monies was more than $640\u00a0billion on Jan. 3, according to coinmarketcap.com. That is a lot to pay for almost nothing, but it is well below 1 percent of global GDP.  The\u00a0speed of the recent ascent\u00a0should\u00a0ensure that the amount of borrowing secured by the value of these essentially valueless assets is\u00a0only\u00a0a tiny fraction of their nominal worth. When financial prices collapse, bad loans\u00a0tend to\u00a0cause most of\u00a0the\u00a0damage. The bonfire of the cryptos\u00a0should therefore hardly\u00a0cause\u00a0an economic ripple\u00a0\u2013 as long as it comes fairly soon.  Still\u00a0\u2013 like the Albanian craze of 1996 \u2013 this episode provides\u00a0further evidence of the failures of market-based finance.\u00a0The standard defence of the system\u2019s reliance on pandering to investors\u2019 greed is that this is the best way to funnel funds into productive investments.

          "body": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria\u2019s electricity grid has been shut down by a fire on a gas pipeline, the ministry of power said on Wednesday, as the country\u2019s power infrastructure continues to struggle.  Gas supply to several power stations was cut off because of the fire on the Escravos Lagos Pipeline System near Okada in the southern state of Edo, the ministry said.  \u201cThe sudden loss of generation due to interruption in gas supply from these stations caused the national transmission grid to trip off around 20:20 on 2nd January,\u201d it said.  The outage went unnoticed in parts of Nigeria, where blackouts are common and many businesses and households are forced to rely on their own power generators or, for the less wealthy, not have any electricity.  The country\u2019s dilapidated power grid is often blamed for hobbling growth in Africa\u2019s largest economy.  Nigeria\u2019s state oil firm, which owns and operates the gas pipelines, said it was working to restore gas supply on the affected pipelines, which feed power plants in the country\u2019s southwest.  Putting out the fire \u201cmight lead to a complete shutdown of the pipeline segment\u201d and hit gas supply to customers in the three southwestern states of Lagos, Ondo and Ogun, the company said.  That will shut down power plants generating 1,143 megawatts of electricity, it added. Nigeria\u2019s total power generation capacity is about 7,000 megawatts.  Most of Nigeria\u2019s power generation is from thermal power stations that use gas, according to the power ministry.  \u201cOnce the national grid is restored, output from the hydroelectric power stations and all other unaffected gas-fired thermal power stations will be increased to the extent possible to minimize the impact of loss of generation from the affected power stations,\u201d it said.  Some businesses were not affected by the blackout, while for others the outage went unheeded.  Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas - a joint venture between the state oil firm, Shell, Total and Eni - was unaffected, a spokesman said.  In the city of Bauchi in northeast Nigeria, the grid outage went unnoticed because people have already had weeks of power cuts.  Balarabe Musa, a metalworker in Bauchi, complained that hours-long blackouts were eating into his wages. \u201cI can\u2019t use a generator to do my job, I need a constant power supply for welding metals,\u201d he said.  Government offices in Bauchi rely on generators, but high fuel costs mean they are too expensive as an alternative for some people.  Hairdresser Mama Ngozi said: \u201cI can\u2019t continue running the salon if the power failures continue like this.\u201d  Reporting by Tife Owolabi; Additional reporting by Ardo Hazzad in Bauchi and Alexis Akwagyiram in London; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Adrian Croft and Jane Merriman"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Palladium extended last year\u2019s more than 50 percent surge to hit record highs on Tuesday, as Chinese car sales growth, tightening emissions controls and a swing away from diesel cars in Europe fueled fears of a metal shortage after years of market deficit.  Spot palladium hit a peak of $1,096.50 an ounce on Tuesday, just above its 2001 high of $1,095 an ounce.    A switch to gasoline-powered and hybrid cars, which use more palladium in their autocatalysts, has fueled fears that market tightness could lead to a shortage of supply. The market has been in deficit in six out of the last seven years for which data is available.   That shortfall has led to a draw-down of available stocks. Holdings of palladium-backed exchange-traded funds fell to their lowest since 2010 last year, with some analysts citing market tightness, which they say drew physical metal out of the funds.  Palladium, some three-quarters of which is used in catalytic converters, chiefly for gasoline engines, hit a series of 17-year highs in 2017 on expectations that automotive demand would continue to improve.  \u201cUnderlying the speculative investment flows is a very strong fundamental picture,\u201d ICBC Standard Bank analyst Tom Kendall said. \u201cPalladium is one of the few metals markets that is genuinely tight and looks like it will continue to tighten.\u201d     \u201cWhen you overlay the growth in car sales in China, which is a gasoline market, with the ongoing switch away from diesel in Europe, it adds up to a much better demand story for palladium than for platinum,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is drawing down inventories, and there is no easy supply response.\u201d  Diesel market share in Europe has been under pressure since carmaker Volkswagen admitted in 2015 that it had used illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests, slipping below 50 percent the following year for the first time since 2009.  Meanwhile, Chinese car sales growth held firm in 2017.   While there are solid reasons for palladium\u2019s move, analysts said the strength of its recent gains suggests it may be overstretched in the near term. The metal eased 1 percent on Wednesday, though it remains at elevated levels.  \u201cThe fundamentals are strong, it\u2019s true, and this is spilling over into continued tight physical availability which is reflected in the outright price and a deeply backwardated forward market,\u201d Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said, referring to the higher price of palladium contracts for imminent delivery versus the more distant future.   \u201cBut this has the mark of a spec squeeze especially given (Tuesday\u2019s) thin trading, right at the start of the year with many market participants still enjoying holidays.\u201d  In the longer term, there are clear risks to the rally.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Harry\u2019s wedding to American actress Meghan Markle could provide a 500 million pound boost to Britain\u2019s economy as tourists flock to the country and Britons celebrate, according to an estimate.  Harry, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson and fifth-in-line to the throne, will tie the knot with Markle on May 19 at Windsor Castle, the royal palace home of British kings and queens for almost 1,000 years.  There were an extra 350,000 visitors to the UK in April 2011 when Harry\u2019s elder brother William married his wife Kate compared to the same month the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics.  Business valuation consultancy Brand Finance predicted a similar surge in May and in total, it estimates the nuptials will generate some 500 million pounds ($680 million).  \u201cWe think approximately 200 million pounds will come from tourism, travel, hotels,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive David Haigh told Reuters.  About 150 million pounds would be spent on people having parties and celebrating with 50 million coming from people buying T-shirts, hats and other commemorative items, he said.   The wedding would also be worth about 100 million pounds in free advertising for Britain around the world, he added.  Businesses in Windsor are already gearing up to take advantage of the worldwide interest in the couple, with Harry, 33, one of the most popular members of the British royal family and Markle, 36, best known for her starring role in the TV legal drama \u201cSuits\u201d, providing some Hollywood sparkle.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a massive boost for the economy, it\u2019s going to be great to see so many people here for the wedding and actually to host the wedding itself,\u201d said Andrew Lee, manager of the Harte and Garter hotel opposite Windsor Castle.  Since their engagement was announced in November, Harry and Meghan merchandise has adorned the displays of Windsor\u2019s tourist shops and mayor John Lenton said the town had been caught up in the excitement.  \u201cWe are looking forward to it and we hope it will help to improve our tourist trades,\u201d he said.  British tourism bosses are already predicting 2018 to be a bumper year for the industry, aided by a fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 vote to leave the European Union which has attracted visitors and deterred Britons from vacationing abroad.  VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, estimates that 41.7 million visits from overseas will be made to the United Kingdom in 2018, generating 26.9 billion pounds in the process.

          "body": "OSLO (Reuters) - Sales of electric and hybrid cars rose above half of new registrations in Norway in 2017, a record aided by generous subsidies that extended the country\u2019s lead in shifting from fossil-fuel engines, data showed on Wednesday.  Pure electric cars and hybrids, which have both battery power and a diesel or petrol motor, accounted for 52 percent of all new car sales last year in Norway against 40 percent in 2016, the independent Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.  \u201cNo one else is close\u201d in terms of a national share of electric cars, OFV chief Oeyvind Solberg Thorsen said. \u201cFor the first time we have a fossil-fuel market share below 50 percent.\u201d  Norway exempts new electric cars from almost all taxes and grants perks that can be worth thousands of dollars a year in terms of free or subsidized parking, re-charging and use of toll roads, ferries and tunnels.  It also generates almost all its electricity from hydropower, so the shift helps to reduce air pollution and climate change.  Last year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said  Norway was far ahead of other nations such as the Netherlands, Sweden, China, France and Britain in electric car sales.  By the IEA yardstick, which excludes hybrid cars with only a small electric motor that cannot be plugged in, electric car sales in Norway rose to 39 percent in 2017 from 29 in 2016, when the Netherlands was in second on 6.4 percent.  Norwegian car sales in 2017 were topped by the Volkswagen Golf (VOWG_p.DE), BMWi3 (BMWG.DE), Toyota Rav4 (7203.T) and Tesla Model X (TSLA.O). The Tesla is pure electric and others have electric or hybrid versions.  In many countries, high prices of battery-driven cars, limited ranges between recharging and long charging times discourage buyers. Car makers say the disadvantages are dwindling over time with new models.  \u201cWe view Norway as a role model for how electric mobility can be promoted through smart incentives,\u201d a spokesman at BMW\u2019s Munich HQ said. \u201cThe situation would probably be different if these incentives were dropped.\u201d   Other \u201cgood examples\u201d of policies to spur electric-car demand include Britain, California and the Netherlands, he said.  Last year, Norway\u2019s parliament set a non-binding goal that by 2025 all cars sold should be zero emissions. Among other nations, France and Britain plan to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040.  Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association which represents owners, said the 2025 goal meant that Norway should stick with its incentives for electric cars.  \u201cIt\u2019s an ambitious goal only seven years away,\u201d she told Reuters. Overall, sales of zero emissions cars in Norway rose in 2017 to 21 percent from 16 in 2016.  Electric cars have widespread support among Norway\u2019s 5.3 million people. A plan last year by the right-wing government to trim electric car incentives, dubbed a \u201cTesla Tax\u201d, was dropped in negotiations on the 2018 budget.   Sales of diesel cars fell most in 2017, to 23 percent from 31 in 2016. Some regions in Norway have started to charge higher road tolls for diesel cars than for petrol-driven vehicles.  Norway\u2019s electric car policies are hard to imitate. Norway can be generous because high revenues from oil and gas production have helped it amass the world\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth fund, worth $1 trillion.  Illustrating the supportive benefits, a Volkswagen e-Golf electric car sells for 262,000 crowns ($32,300) in Norway, just fractionally above the import price of 260,000, according to the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association.  But a comparable gasoline-powered Golf, which costs just 180,000 crowns to import, ends up selling for 298,000 crowns after charges including value added tax, carbon tax, and another tax based on the weight of the vehicle.  Even in Norway, the benefits strain finances. Norway\u2019s 1.3 trillion Norwegian crown budget projects a loss of tax revenues of 3 billion crowns a year because of electric cars.

          "body": "BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Economics student Mutassim al-Misrati lost his leg in an RPG attack in April 2014 while fighting in Benghazi, his home city.           Back then Misrati had joined the forces that were beginning to coalesce around Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, who weeks later would launch a campaign to take control of Benghazi, Libya\u2019s second city.  Haftar, now the dominant figure in eastern Libya and a likely candidate in elections that may happen by the end of the year, finally declared victory in Benghazi in July 2017, though fighting continued in one area of the city until last week.  The win has come at the cost of thousands of dead and many more wounded who receive little care.  Since 2014, Libya has been split between rival military factions and governments, causing an economic decline and collapse in health services that have left many veterans to fend largely for themselves.  Misrati received medical care the year he was wounded, and has a prosthetic leg that allowed him to return to studying for an economics degree and working at a fish market.  \u201cIn 2014, I received care but at the present moment in time there is neglect when it comes to all of those wounded,\u201d Misrati said.   He is still a supporter of Haftar, whose campaign in Benghazi, \u201cOperation Dignity\u201d, battled Islamists and other opponents, some of them former rebels who had fought to topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.   \u201cI fought and dedicated myself to my country. Thank God, I was spared and now I am back with my work and my people,\u201d Misrati said.  \u201cThere are amputees who have not received prosthetic legs, though some received prosthetics. Some are able to run, just like I am able to run, and to live.\u201d  There are no independent estimates for overall casualties from the conflict in Benghazi, though Ahmed al-Mismari, a spokesman for Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army (LNA), said about 6,000 of their men had died.   The LNA special forces, which played a leading role in the fighting, lost about 1,500 men and had some 2,500 wounded, said Colonel Milad al-Zawi, a spokesman.   Veterans get a one-off payment of 2,000 dinars, currently the equivalent of just $225 at black market rates that set the price of many goods in Libya. Though foreign governments have flown some wounded fighters abroad for treatment, seeking medical treatment outside the country has become prohibitively expensive for most.   In Benghazi, daily struggles with liquidity shortages and inflation have dampened hopes brought by an end to the fighting.  \u201cBenghazi is full of the blood of martyrs,\u201d said Misrati. \u201cIt wants the nation to be at rest, it wants cash, it wants uncrowded bakeries, petrol, electricity.\u201d   Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky"

          "title": "Nigerian power grid shut-down goes unnoticed in parts of country",
          "body": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria\u2019s electricity grid has been shut down by a fire on a gas pipeline, the ministry of power said on Wednesday, as the country\u2019s power infrastructure continues to struggle.  Gas supply to several power stations was cut off because of the fire on the Escravos Lagos Pipeline System near Okada in the southern state of Edo, the ministry said.  \u201cThe sudden loss of generation due to interruption in gas supply from these stations caused the national transmission grid to trip off around 20:20 on 2nd January,\u201d it said.  The outage went unnoticed in parts of Nigeria, where blackouts are common and many businesses and households are forced to rely on their own power generators or, for the less wealthy, not have any electricity.  The country\u2019s dilapidated power grid is often blamed for hobbling growth in Africa\u2019s largest economy.  Nigeria\u2019s state oil firm, which owns and operates the gas pipelines, said it was working to restore gas supply on the affected pipelines, which feed power plants in the country\u2019s southwest.  Putting out the fire \u201cmight lead to a complete shutdown of the pipeline segment\u201d and hit gas supply to customers in the three southwestern states of Lagos, Ondo and Ogun, the company said.  That will shut down power plants generating 1,143 megawatts of electricity, it added. Nigeria\u2019s total power generation capacity is about 7,000 megawatts.  Most of Nigeria\u2019s power generation is from thermal power stations that use gas, according to the power ministry.  \u201cOnce the national grid is restored, output from the hydroelectric power stations and all other unaffected gas-fired thermal power stations will be increased to the extent possible to minimize the impact of loss of generation from the affected power stations,\u201d it said.  Some businesses were not affected by the blackout, while for others the outage went unheeded.  Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas - a joint venture between the state oil firm, Shell, Total and Eni - was unaffected, a spokesman said.  In the city of Bauchi in northeast Nigeria, the grid outage went unnoticed because people have already had weeks of power cuts.  Balarabe Musa, a metalworker in Bauchi, complained that hours-long blackouts were eating into his wages. \u201cI can\u2019t use a generator to do my job, I need a constant power supply for welding metals,\u201d he said.  Government offices in Bauchi rely on generators, but high fuel costs mean they are too expensive as an alternative for some people.  Hairdresser Mama Ngozi said: \u201cI can\u2019t continue running the salon if the power failures continue like this.\u201d  Reporting by Tife Owolabi; Additional reporting by Ardo Hazzad in Bauchi and Alexis Akwagyiram in London; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Adrian Croft and Jane Merriman"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Palladium extended last year\u2019s more than 50 percent surge to hit record highs on Tuesday, as Chinese car sales growth, tightening emissions controls and a swing away from diesel cars in Europe fueled fears of a metal shortage after years of market deficit.  Spot palladium hit a peak of $1,096.50 an ounce on Tuesday, just above its 2001 high of $1,095 an ounce.    A switch to gasoline-powered and hybrid cars, which use more palladium in their autocatalysts, has fueled fears that market tightness could lead to a shortage of supply. The market has been in deficit in six out of the last seven years for which data is available.   That shortfall has led to a draw-down of available stocks. Holdings of palladium-backed exchange-traded funds fell to their lowest since 2010 last year, with some analysts citing market tightness, which they say drew physical metal out of the funds.  Palladium, some three-quarters of which is used in catalytic converters, chiefly for gasoline engines, hit a series of 17-year highs in 2017 on expectations that automotive demand would continue to improve.  \u201cUnderlying the speculative investment flows is a very strong fundamental picture,\u201d ICBC Standard Bank analyst Tom Kendall said. \u201cPalladium is one of the few metals markets that is genuinely tight and looks like it will continue to tighten.\u201d     \u201cWhen you overlay the growth in car sales in China, which is a gasoline market, with the ongoing switch away from diesel in Europe, it adds up to a much better demand story for palladium than for platinum,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is drawing down inventories, and there is no easy supply response.\u201d  Diesel market share in Europe has been under pressure since carmaker Volkswagen admitted in 2015 that it had used illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests, slipping below 50 percent the following year for the first time since 2009.  Meanwhile, Chinese car sales growth held firm in 2017.   While there are solid reasons for palladium\u2019s move, analysts said the strength of its recent gains suggests it may be overstretched in the near term. The metal eased 1 percent on Wednesday, though it remains at elevated levels.  \u201cThe fundamentals are strong, it\u2019s true, and this is spilling over into continued tight physical availability which is reflected in the outright price and a deeply backwardated forward market,\u201d Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said, referring to the higher price of palladium contracts for imminent delivery versus the more distant future.   \u201cBut this has the mark of a spec squeeze especially given (Tuesday\u2019s) thin trading, right at the start of the year with many market participants still enjoying holidays.\u201d  In the longer term, there are clear risks to the rally. Palladium\u2019s heavy reliance on car sales for demand - unlike platinum, its jewellery market is small - could make it vulnerable to a sharp retracement if signs emerge that sales are slowing.    A move towards vehicle electrification would also cut down demand for catalytic converters. However, that is too far off to pose a significant risk the market at present, Kendall said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is within anyone\u2019s ability to take a commodities investment position on e-vehicles yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many unknowns.\u201d  In the meantime, market tightness has sent the metal back to levels not seen since 2001, a time when U.S. carmakers were panicking over the U.S. authorities\u2019 shift in emphasis to tackling unburned hydrocarbon emissions, GFMS\u2019 head of research and forecasts Rhona O\u2019Connell said. This rally looks more solid, she said.  \u201cThis time around it\u2019s genuine fundamentals (that are driving the rally), and some spec activity, in the belief that the pressure on diesel will favor gasoline,\u201d she said.

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - A majority of French people would favor allowing surrogate motherhood, though primarily only for medical reasons, a poll showed on Wednesday, highlighting a shift in attitudes as France prepares to review laws relating to assisted reproduction.  All forms of surrogacy, where a woman gives birth to a child on behalf of someone else, are banned in France, as in several other European countries such as Germany. Some countries like the United Kingdom allow for altruistic surrogacies, not commercial ones.  The French government will launch a debate on a new bioethics legislative pact this year, which could see medically assisted reproduction extended to female gay couples and single women, a stance favored by President Emmanuel Macron.  He opposes introducing surrogate motherhood, however.  Until recently public opinion was also against surrogacy, but the poll by Ifop, published in La Croix, a Catholic newspaper, found that 62 percent of French people were now in favor of it.  Of those, 46 percent would only back surrogate motherhood if there were medical reasons to do so, while 18 percent said they supported it in all circumstances.  In a similar poll last September, 52 percent of French people rejected surrogacy under any form, versus 36 percent now.  France\u2019s previous Socialist government legalized same-sex marriage in 2013, drawing a strong unexpectedly show of opposition in the run-up to the law from conservatives, especially Roman Catholics, and large street protests.  France\u2019s highest court has since made it easier for children born through surrogacy abroad to a same-sex couple to be recognized as citizens and adopted by the partner of the child\u2019s biological father."

          "body": "Jan 3 (Reuters) - Spark Therapeutics Inc said on Wednesday it would charge $850,000 per patient for its gene therapy to treat a rare form of blindness, lesser than analysts\u2019 expectation of around $1 million.  The company said the list price of the therapy, which was approved by the FDA last month, would be $425,000 per dose. (bit.ly/2CxDOZr)  To be sure, the list price of a drug is not necessarily what patients actually pay. Their out-of-pocket cost is based on their individual healthcare insurance plans and duration of treatment.  The FDA\u2019s approval of Spark\u2019s treatment, Luxturna, marks the first time the agency has approved a gene therapy for an inherited disease.  Luxturna treats inherited retinal disease caused by defects in a gene known as RPE65, which tells cells to produce an enzyme critical for normal vision. The condition affects between 1,000 and 2,000 people in the United States.  Shares of the drug developer rose 1.3 percent to $54 on Wednesday.

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a first-time Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B' to Barracuda Networks, Inc. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also assigned a 'BB-'/'RR2' rating to the $75 million secured revolving credit facility (RCF) and $555 million first-lien secured term loan; and a 'CCC+'/'RR6' rating to the $205 million second-lien secured term loan. The proceeds, along with equity contributions from Thoma Bravo, and cash on the balance sheet will be used to fund the $1.6 billion acquisition that was announced on Nov. 27, 2017. Fitch's rating actions affect $835 million total debt, including the $75 million RCF. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Product Range Supporting Small to Midsize Businesses (SMB) Segment: Barracuda offers products addressing a wide range of IT needs for SMB customers that generally have limited financial and technical resources dedicated to IT management. Its products include Next Generation Firewall, Web App Firewall, Email Security Gateway, Web Security Gateway, Security and Archiving for Office 365, and Backup/Data Protection. The availability of these products through both appliance- and cloud-based platforms enables its SMB customers to simplify IT security and data storage management. Fitch believes the breadth of products available positions Barracuda well in a segment that prefers simplicity over sophisticated solutions. Secular Tailwind Supports Growth: We believe two factors serve as the fundamental demand drivers. Barracuda's cloud-based solutions enable the company to benefit from the steady pace of IT workload migrating from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud. In addition, increasing awareness of IT security threats is leading companies to allocate more resources to protecting their networks and data; some of the high-visibility IT security breaches include data breaches and ransomware that could be costly or cause damage to a company's reputation. High Revenue Retention Rate: Barracuda has maintained a high subscription-revenue retention rate of over 100% for four of the last five fiscal years and that demonstrates its ability to retain active subscribers and upsell additional products. Fitch believes the high level of retention rates generally lead to high level of revenue predictability. Diversified Customer Base: Consistent with the fragmented nature of the SMB segment, Barracuda serves a large set of customers, with approximately 180,000 customers, including 16,000 that use more than three products. Fitch believes the diverse customer base could partially mitigate inherent risks in the SMB segment through the economic cycles. Susceptible to Industry Cyclicality: Barracuda is susceptible to IT security industry cycles, as illustrated by its FY2017 and first half FY2018 (1H18) slowdown in revenue growth. Fitch believes the weakness may have been the result of strong growth in the previous years coinciding with the heightened IT security awareness that propelled overall industry growth. We view the current industry environment as normal and a more realistic base for assessing future growth potential. Nevertheless, Barracuda's focus on IT and data security will continue to expose the company to industry cyclicality. Leverage to Remain Elevated: Pro forma for cost savings and the leveraged buyout by Thoma Bravo, gross leverage will be elevated at 7.2x for FY2019, in line with peers in the 'B' rating category; Fitch expects this to trend down to below 5.5x by FY2021. In addition to debt issuance, Thoma Bravo will be making $715 million in equity contributions; Fitch believes this demonstrates Thoma Bravo's commitment and confidence in the industry and the company. Barracuda has a history of acquiring complementary technologies and products, the most recent being Sookasa and Sonian; Fitch believes the company will remain acquisitive in order to keep pace with the fast-moving industry, limiting its deleveraging to primarily EBITDA growth. DERIVATION SUMMARY Fitch's ratings are supported by Barracuda's focus on IT and data security for the SMB segment and the secular growth trend for the IT security industry. Barracuda's wide range of products are primarily offered as cloud-based, making them easily accessible and manageable by SMB customers that prefer simplicity over sophistication in IT security, as is reflected by its over 180,000 customers. The subscription nature of the products and high revenue retention rates provide a high level of predictability for its revenues. Predictability is marginally tempered by the risks inherent to the SMB segment that Barracuda is exposed to through the economic cycles. At the IT security industry level, Fitch believes the heightened awareness of IT security risks arising from high-profile security breaches in recent years provides support for the secular growth of the industry. The announced $1.6 billion acquisition by Thoma Bravo will be financed with $760 million in term loans, equity contribution from Thoma Bravo, and cash on the balance sheet at closing. Fitch forecasts Barracuda's gross leverage for FY2019 to be 7.2x, gradually declining to below 5.5x by FY2021. Barracuda's industry expertise, revenue scale, and leverage profile are consistent with the 'B' rating category. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer: --Revenue growth in the high single digits; --EBITDA margins in the mid-to-high 20% range after completion of cost reduction measures; --Capex at approximately 2.3% of revenue, consistent with historical trend; --Acquisitions averaging $20 million per year for FY2019-2021, enabling the company to expand product lines and technologies; --No dividend payment through our forecast period. In estimating a distressed enterprise value (EV) for Barracuda, Fitch assumes that in a distressed scenario, customers may elect to switch to competing service providers, leading to revenue decline and margin compression on a reduced scale; resulting in going-concern EBITDA that is approximately 15% lower compared to LTM EBITDA. Fitch applies a 6.5x multiple to arrive at EV of $512 million. In the 13th edition of Fitch's Bankruptcy Enterprise Values and Creditor Recoveries case studies, Fitch notes seven past reorganizations in the Technology sector with recovery multiples ranging from 2.6x to 8.4x. Of these companies, only two were in the Software sector, Allen Systems Group, Inc. and Aspect Software Parent, Inc., which received recovery multiples of 8.4x and 5.5x, respectively. Fitch believes Barracuda's operating profile supports a recovery multiple in the middle of this range. In the current transaction to acquire Barracuda, Thoma Bravo is valuing the company at approximately 17x EBITDA; we believe the high acquisition multiple also supports our recovery multiple assumption. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action: --Expectation for gross leverage sustaining below 5.5x; --Pre-dividend FCF margins sustaining above 10%; --Organic revenue growth sustaining near or above 5%. Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Expectation for gross leverage sustaining above 7x, possibly due to debt-financed acquisitions or dividend payment to owners; --Pre-dividend FCF margins sustaining below 5%; --Organic revenue growth sustained near or below 0%. LIQUIDITY Fitch expects the company's liquidity to remain solid over the forecast period. Pro forma for the Thoma Bravo transaction, liquidity will be supported by internal FCF generation, a new $75 million RCF, and over $75 million of readily available cash and cash equivalents post-closing. Barracuda's FCF is supported by normalized EBITDA margins of approximately 25%; Fitch estimates FCF to be initially curbed in large part by restricted stock unit payout, and FCF margins to gradually normalize near 10% and approach $50 million at the end of our forecast period. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following ratings: Barracuda Networks, Inc. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating 'B'; Outlook Stable; --$75 million first-lien secured revolving credit facility 'BB-'/'RR2'; --$555 million first-lien secured term loan 'BB-'/'RR2'; --$205 million second-lien secured term loan 'CCC+'/'RR6'.

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Other countries should follow Iceland which has become the  first country to make it illegal to pay men more than women,  politicians and equal rights campaigners said on Wednesday.  Iceland has been widely praised for introducing legislation on Jan. 1 that imposes fines on any company or government agency with over 25 staff without a government certificate demonstrating pay equality.  Iceland is the world\u2019s most gender equal country, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF), which analyzed gaps in education, health, economic opportunity and political empowerment. Yemen is the least gender-equal, it found.   Here are some facts about the gender pay gap:  * The average pay for women globally is $12,000, compared with $21,000 for men, WEF said last year, forecasting that women will not earn as much as men for 217 years.  * Closing the pay gap could add an extra $250 billion to the GDP of Britain, $1,750 billion to that of the United States and $2.5 trillion to China\u2019s GDP, it said.  * The difference between hourly pay rates for men and women in Britain\u2019s workforce fell to its lowest in 20 years in 2017, with male full-time employees earning 9.1 percent more than females, government data showed.  * The top ranking countries for economic participation and opportunity are Burundi, Barbados, Bahamas, Benin and Belarus, all with a gap of less than 20 percent, WEF said.  * The five worst are Syria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Iran, with an economic gender gap of at least 65 percent.  * Globally, 22 percent of senior managers are women and they are more likely to work in industries with lower pay, WEF says.  * Data shows an under-use of educated women in the workforce, largely because of additional responsibilities at home, discrimination and under-representation in fields like engineering, manufacturing and technology, it said.      * The European Commission proposed in November a two-year plan for closing the gender pay gap after finding little improvement in the past five years, with women in the European Union earning 16.3 percent less per hour on average than men.  * The proposal includes setting minimum sanctions for companies that do not provide equal pay and monitoring the diversity policies of Europe\u2019s largest companies.

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Young male refugees in Germany got the blame on Wednesday for most of a two-year increase in violent crime, adding fuel to the country\u2019s political debate over migrants.  Violent crime rose by about 10 percent in 2015 and 2016, a study showed. It attributed more than 90 percent of that to young male refugees.  It noted, however, that migrants settling from war-torn countries such as Syria were much less likely to commit violent crimes that those from other places who were unlikely to be given asylum.  Migration will be a key issue in forthcoming coalition talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). The arrival of more than a million migrants since mid-2015 hurt both parties in last September\u2019s election.   The government-sponsored study showed a jump in violent crime committed by male migrants aged 14 to 30.  Christian Pfeiffer, a criminology expert and one of the study researchers, told Deutschlandfunk radio there were huge differences between various refugee groups depending on where they came from and how high their chances were of staying and gaining legal status in Germany.  Asylum seekers who are regarded as war refugees who have relatively good chances of staying in Germany tend to avoid trouble more, the study found.  Around 17 percent of violent crimes in Lower Saxony that were attributed to refugees, for example, were suspected of being committed by North African asylum seekers who made up less than 1 percent of the state\u2019s registered refugee population. North African asylum seekers have relatively slim chances of obtaining legal status in Germany.  \u201cThe situation is completely different for those who find out as soon as they arrive that they are totally undesirable here. No chance of working, of staying here,\u201d Pfeiffer said.  The study said reuniting refugees with their families by allowing them to come to Germany too could help to reduce violence. Such reunions look set to be a particularly contentious issue in talks about a new coalition government.   The predominantly young male majority of refugees live in Germany without partners, mothers, sisters or other females whom the study sees as a \u201cviolence-preventing, civilising force.\u201d  Reporting By Riham Alkousaa Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Harry\u2019s wedding to American actress Meghan Markle could provide a 500 million pound boost to Britain\u2019s economy as tourists flock to the country and Britons celebrate, according to an estimate.  Harry, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson and fifth-in-line to the throne, will tie the knot with Markle on May 19 at Windsor Castle, the royal palace home of British kings and queens for almost 1,000 years.  There were an extra 350,000 visitors to the UK in April 2011 when Harry\u2019s elder brother William married his wife Kate compared to the same month the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics.  Business valuation consultancy Brand Finance predicted a similar surge in May and in total, it estimates the nuptials will generate some 500 million pounds ($680 million).  \u201cWe think approximately 200 million pounds will come from tourism, travel, hotels,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive David Haigh told Reuters.  About 150 million pounds would be spent on people having parties and celebrating with 50 million coming from people buying T-shirts, hats and other commemorative items, he said.   The wedding would also be worth about 100 million pounds in free advertising for Britain around the world, he added.  Businesses in Windsor are already gearing up to take advantage of the worldwide interest in the couple, with Harry, 33, one of the most popular members of the British royal family and Markle, 36, best known for her starring role in the TV legal drama \u201cSuits\u201d, providing some Hollywood sparkle.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a massive boost for the economy, it\u2019s going to be great to see so many people here for the wedding and actually to host the wedding itself,\u201d said Andrew Lee, manager of the Harte and Garter hotel opposite Windsor Castle.  Since their engagement was announced in November, Harry and Meghan merchandise has adorned the displays of Windsor\u2019s tourist shops and mayor John Lenton said the town had been caught up in the excitement.  \u201cWe are looking forward to it and we hope it will help to improve our tourist trades,\u201d he said.  British tourism bosses are already predicting 2018 to be a bumper year for the industry, aided by a fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 vote to leave the European Union which has attracted visitors and deterred Britons from vacationing abroad.  VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, estimates that 41.7 million visits from overseas will be made to the United Kingdom in 2018, generating 26.9 billion pounds in the process.

          "body": " CHICAGO (Reuters) - Dreaming of a beach house? You might want to think twice about that, given tax changes that just kicked in will make owning a vacation home more costly and may tank the resale value of the second-home market.  Prices could drop about 10 percent in some markets, said Zillow (www.zillow.com) economist Aaron Terrazas, with pricey coastal areas the most vulnerable.\u00a0This will not be good news for owners in popular areas who have already been waiting a decade for prices to recover the value lost during the housing crash and recession.  After the 2006 housing peak, prices dropped more than 50 percent in many popular vacation areas, and remain far off those highs. Zillow data indicates homes in Fort Myers, Florida remain 24 percent below the pre-crash peak, and Ocean City, New Jersey is still down 19 percent despite the draw of beach communities.\u00a0Overall, purchases have been declining for three years.  Researchers from Gallup Inc to the Urban Institute have traced slower home buying to multiple factors \u2013 from difficulty getting mortgages to the uncertainty that an expensive investment would appreciate enough to make a purchase worthwhile.  The new tax rules will have a big impact because many second-home buyers are middle-income households, not the super rich, and even a shift of a few thousand dollars can greatly affect affordability. The median buyer\u2019s household income in 2016 was $89,900, and only 34 percent of buyers had household incomes over $100,000, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Almost three-quarters used mortgage financing.  While second homeowners can still deduct the interest on new mortgages up to $750,000, experts predict that many people will no longer itemize their expenses on Schedule A. The new tax rules raise the standard deduction to $24,000 for a married couple, and this may be too high a threshold for many people to reach without being able to claim more than $10,000 in combined property and other state and local taxes.  Also, homeowners can no longer deduct interest on home equity loans. That is likely to hold back vacation home buying because many people use home equity on their main residence to purchase additional homes, said Zillow\u2019s Terrazas.  When homeowners think about the long-term impact on their finances, the math becomes even trickier. People are looking at vacation homes as longer-term commitments than in the past, with the average buyer planning to own the home nine years compared with five years in 2015, NAR reported.\u00a0  As baby boomers think about future retirement, some are buying vacation properties while still working and use them occasionally as a retreat.\u00a0Eventually, 18 percent plan to turn those second homes into homes for retirement.  The only way to afford this in the future may be to become a landlord.  If an individual turns their vacation home into a rental property and uses a business tax structure such as a limited liability company or C Corporation, they will be able to deduct mortgage interest and property taxes as a business expense, said Cliff Johnson, co-founder of Vacasa, which manages vacation homes.  Such an approach is not for everyone, however, and generally requires attention to tax details. For one thing, when you decide to sell the property as a business you may have to pay more in capital gains taxes if the home has appreciated in value, said Alison Flores, researcher for the H&R Block Tax Institute.  Some individuals could get around this making the property qualify as a private residence again by moving back in prior to the sale.  Owners can still use their vacation home for personal use and rent it out, if they keep records of the usage. Expenses can be deducted, but income is also taxable if you rent out a home for more than 14 days.  Then there is the hassle factor, which can be hard to calculate. According to NAR research, 15 percent of people who tried renting out their vacation homes decided they would not do it again.  \u201cPeople might have bought the property to relax,\u201d said Vacasa\u2019s Johnson.\u00a0\u201cBut one or two years later they may realize they never relaxed.\u201d  Editing by Beth Pinsker and Andrew Hay"

          "body": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Other countries should follow Iceland which has become the  first country to make it illegal to pay men more than women,  politicians and equal rights campaigners said on Wednesday.  Iceland has been widely praised for introducing legislation on Jan. 1 that imposes fines on any company or government agency with over 25 staff without a government certificate demonstrating pay equality.  The move is part of a bid to eradicate the gender pay gap by 2022 in the Nordic nation where 38 percent of parliamentarians are female - above the global average - including Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir.  \u201cIceland is ranked as world\u2019s most gender equal country by (the World Economic Forum) ... Clearly Iceland is very serious about gender equality,\u201d former New Zealand Prime Minister\u00a0Helen Clark\u00a0wrote on Twitter.  Equal rights researchers said they hoped Iceland\u2019s legislation would encourage others to follow suit in tackling the gender pay gap while also highlighting the need to address the lack of women politicians globally.   The World Economic Forum reported last year reported an economic gap of 58 percent between the sexes and forecast women would have to wait 217 years before they earn as much as men and have equal representation in the workplace.  This gap was highlighted amid growing concerns about the lack of female lawmakers globally as figures show only about one in four parliamentarians is a woman and fewer than one in five government ministers is female.  Data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the international organization of parliaments, showed women held 23.6 percent of seats in 193 parliaments on September 2017.  \u201cThe new law by Iceland can help change attitudes to women in business as well as in politics, and inspire other countries to do the same,\u201d said Virginie Le Masson, a research fellow at the London-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI).   \u201cAmple evidence shows that women work as much as men and are still paid less,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  U.S. independent Bernie Sanders, a leading liberal voice in the Senate, called on the United States to follow Iceland\u2019s example.  \u201cWe must follow the example of our brothers and sisters in Iceland and demand equal pay for equal work now, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexuality or nationality,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page.  Iceland, with a population of about 335,000, ranked top of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index in 2017 for the ninth consecutive year after closing more than 87 percent of its gender gap and top performer on political empowerment.

          "body": "INNSBRUCK, Austria (Reuters) - Olympic gold medalist and two-time world champion Bode Miller has told Reuters that Mikaela Shiffrin is the best alpine ski racer he has ever seen and that she could win a slew of medals for the U.S. at the upcoming Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.   Shiffrin, who won gold in the slalom at the Sochi Olympics in 2014, is currently top of the overall World Cup standings after racking up a series of good results so far this season.  Miller, the most decorated U.S. Olympic skier with six medals, believed that the 22-year-old could even equal his record tally next month at the Games in South Korea.   \u201cI think she\u2019s maybe the best ski racer I\u2019ve ever seen, male or female. She\u2019s so balanced, dynamic, intense and focused, so for me, I think she\u2019s got a chance in any event she skis in,\u201d the 40-year-old said.   \u201cI would say it\u2019s likely she wins two (Olympic) golds, I would say an outside shot at five medals, and I think probably, at her best, maybe three or four of them are golds,\u201d he added.  Miller, who retired last November after 20 years in ski racing, is looking forward to embracing technology as part of his role at Eurosport covering the Games to help viewers gain a better understanding of Alpine skiing.  \u201cI\u2019m going to try to bring knowledge to people, so that I can educate them and make watching the sport more fun and more exciting,\u201d Miller said.   Part of his brief is to use the Eurosport Cube, a studio incorporating augmented reality and enhanced data, to explain the technical details to look out for in the various disciplines.  \u201cIf it was just verbal, if I was on the radio I couldn\u2019t explain anything, but then television brings it to the next level, where people can see what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d he added.  Miller also said that media work was not something he had planned for in his retirement.   \u201cThis is more of an experiment. I\u2019ve made a really strong effort of the last six years or seven years to stay in the sport because I love it, and because I think it needs people who love it to make it exciting and make it fun for people to watch.  \u201cIf I can help and it works and it\u2019s good, and I can make the athletes be inspired and ski harder and take more risks, and make it better for the people at home to watch, then maybe I\u2019ll stay in it,\u201d he said.

          "body": "PRISTINA (Reuters) - Four Kosovo opposition lawmakers were handed suspended jail terms of between 15 and 18 months on Wednesday for obstructing parliamentary work by releasing tear gas in the chamber.  Opposition parliamentarians impeded parliament for almost two years by letting off tear gas in the chamber in 2015 and 2016 in protest against a border deal with Montenegro and an EU-brokered agreement with Serbia.  \u201cThey have broken the law by using weapons or dangerous instruments,\u201d judge Beqir Kalludra said as he read the verdict, referring to the leader of the biggest opposition party Vetevendosje, Albin Kurti, and three other party members.  \u201cThe defendants will not go to jail if they do not repeat any other offence in the next two years,\u201d he said.   None of the defendants, who include two women, were present at the reading of the verdict. They had repeatedly said the court was under the influence of politicians.   Another 11 lawmakers face the same charges and are awaiting verdicts.   Kosovo\u2019s government says the border accord with Montenegro is an important condition for its citizens to eventually benefit from a visa-free travel regime with the European Union.  But Vetevendosje, which became the single biggest party in the parliament after June elections, opposes the deal. They say that by ratifying the agreement, Kosovo would hand over some 8,000 hectares (19,700 acres) of its land to Montenegro.  The party also opposes a 2013 EU-brokered deal between Serbia and Kosovo that gives more autonomy to Kosovo\u2019s Serb minority.  In November last year another party member was sentenced to eight years in jail for taking part in a grenade attack on the parliament building in 2016.  Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after NATO bombing drove Serb forces from the territory.

          "body": "* Dubai index rebounding from bottom of long-term uptrend channel  * Banks lead Saudi market higher  * Riyad Capital predicts price/earnings multiples will expand  * Kuwait blue chips surge  * Egypt\u2019s Global telecom slips as tax authorities seize funds  By Andrew Torchia  DUBAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Most major Gulf stock markets rose on Wednesday as some buyers returned from New Year holidays, and shares in Dubai\u2019s blue chip Emaar group rebounded for a second straight day.  Egypt lagged, however, led lower by a few blue chips.  Dubai\u2019s index added 1.4 percent to 3,459 points in rising volume as Emaar Properties, which had surged 3.6 percent on Tuesday, gained a further 2.9 percent. Emaar Development jumped 3.8 percent and Emaar Malls added 1.8 percent.  Shares in the group fell sharply last year because of a slump in Dubai\u2019s real estate market, but they have become the focus of investors betting that heavy spending by the government will buoy the economy and help the market stabilise this year.  Several other beaten-down Dubai stocks also rebounded on Wednesday, with amusement park operator DXB Entertainments surging 5 percent, although logistics firm Aramex stayed weak, edging down 0.2 percent.  The Dubai index has turned technically bullish this week, beginning to rebound from the bottom of an uptrend channel dating back to early 2016. Technically, a rise in coming months to near the top of the channel would not be surprising, and would take the index above 3,700 points.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s index, which had fallen in the first two days of this year after the government hiked domestic gasoline prices, rebounded 0.7 percent to 7,224 points.  Banks led the market with 10 of 12 gaining ground. National Commercial Bank, the biggest, surged 3.1 percent, although trading volume was modest.  The Saudi index edged up just 0.2 percent last year but many fund managers expect a better 2018 because of higher government spending. Santhosh Balakrishnan and Faisal Potrik, analysts at Riyad Capital, issued a report predicting the index would hit 7,936 points this year.  They based the forecast on the market trading at 14.5 times estimated corporate earnings for 2019, helped by economic reform, expected decisions by MSCI and FTSE to include Riyadh in their emerging markets indexes, and the planned listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco in late 2018 fuelling interest in the market.  After three years of decline, Saudi corporate earnings have started to improve, led by banks and petrochemical firms. This should let price/earnings multiples expand, even though firms\u2019 top lines have so far been stagnant, the analysts argued.  Blue chips were bought in Kuwait on Wednesday with National Bank of Kuwait, the biggest lender, gaining 2.4 percent and logistics giant Agility rising 1.6 percent. The Kuwaiti index climbed 1.4 percent.  Egypt\u2019s blue-chip index fell 1.3 percent on Wednesday, although the broader EGX100 fared much better, slipping only 0.4 percent.  The blue-chip index was dragged down by Commercial International Bank, which fell 1.9 percent, and Global Telecom, which slipped 2.7 percent after saying Egyptian tax authorities were seizing money from its local bank accounts to obtain a contested tax payment of 990 million pounds ($56 million). The company said it would contest the action.  * The index rose 0.7 percent to 7,224 points.  * The index gained 1.4 percent to 3,459 points.  * The index climbed 0.9 percent to 4,481 points.  * The index edged down 0.1 percent to 8,608 points.  * The index fell 1.3 percent to 14,834 points.  * The index surged 1.4 percent to 6,401 points.  * The index rose 0.3 percent to 1,325 points.  * The index edged down 0.1 percent to 5,089 points.

The operation, centered in Istanbul and encompassing nine provinces, targeted \u201cclass A\u201d shareholders who had voting rights to determine the bank\u2019s administrative board, police said.  The state-run Anadolu news agency said 49 of the suspects had been detained so far.  Bank Asya was founded by followers of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, and was seized by the state in 2015 along with other Gulen-linked companies in a government crackdown.  The government says Gulen masterminded the 2016 attempted coup, in which more than 240 people, many of them unarmed civilians, were killed by rogue soldiers. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied the charges and condemned the coup.  Since the abortive putsch, more than 50,000 people, including civil servants and security personnel, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs.

Its streets are packed with cars, lights flicker in offices long after the occupants have gone home, and stark economic divides persist between neighborhoods.  But beneath the surface, something is working in Washington, D.C., experts say.  In August, the city was the first to receive the top \u201cplatinum\u201d certification under a global sustainability program called LEED for Cities, which tracks performance on energy use, waste management, water, transport and even quality of life.   Washington was joined by Phoenix in December.   The LEED for Cities framework, which celebrated its first birthday last month, is an expansion of the world\u2019s most widely used rating system for green buildings.   Places earning top marks with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) could serve as a model for officials around the world seeking to prove to investors and others that their cities are clean, green and offer a high quality of life, experts say.  Last month Arlington County, across the Potomac River from Washington, received the first top certification under another year-old framework, LEED for Communities, which is similar to the cities\u2019 framework but covers different geographical scales.  With more certifications expected in early 2018, organizers say surging interest stems from the Paris Agreement on climate change \u2013 shunned by U.S. President Donald Trump \u2013 which has paved the way for local governments to step up as leaders in caring for the planet.   More than 100 cities around the world have expressed interest in the program so far.   Roger Platt, senior vice president at the U.S. Green Building Council, a nonprofit that created LEED, said Asian partners, including China and India, advised that its initial focus on buildings was too narrow for the breadth and speed at which cities are transforming.  LEED for Cities tracks changes in how a city is performing across 14 metrics. It uses an online platform allowing cities to analyze and compare their progress, focusing on outcomes rather than pledges.     \u201cWe\u2019re at the point now where there\u2019s a tremendous amount of information on strategies to be cleaner,\u201d said Platt.  \u201cWhat\u2019s missing - and what we think we can do - is a very disciplined and rigorous system for determining whether the use of these strategies is actually creating measurable improvement,\u201d he said.   Washington\u2019s top certification under LEED for Cities shows the rapid progress it has made in recent years, Platt noted.  Between 2006 and 2013, it reduced carbon emissions by almost a third, to 11.9 tonnes per capita. Water consumption fell by more than 13 percent in the past five years. And today the city recycles about half of its waste - more than double New York City\u2019s rate.   Washington even does well under the LEED metrics on social equity, which include a city\u2019s affordability and distribution of wealth.  The U.S. capital was an early adopter of strategic plans around sustainability and the data required to measure progress, experts say.  It has focused for years on efficiency in its buildings, as one of the first cities to pass legislation in 2006 requiring use of the LEED for Buildings standard, said Jay Wilson, an analyst with the city\u2019s Urban Sustainability Administration.  It has also regularly raised minimum standards in regulations and enforced rules such as green construction codes.   Wilson said LEED for Cities will now help Washington put all its sustainability data in one place, highlighting potential synergies - for instance, a gauge of miles driven per capita can double as a measure of emissions and walkability.  He also hopes the city can publicize its data in innovative ways, making residents aware of the shift to sustainability and steps households can take to support it.  As more cities go through the certification process, metrics will evolve in line with needs, and new trail-blazers are likely to emerge, organizers say.   \u201cWe look to celebrate what has been accomplished by Washington, but it will be a challenge for them to remain in that leadership role,\u201d Platt said.  Surat, India\u2019s eighth-largest city and among its fastest-growing urban areas, is one city looking to learn from Washington.  A few hours north of Mumbai by car, Surat is working towards the LEED for Cities certification. The city\u2019s expansion has made efficiency in service delivery a key concern, an official said.  M. Nagarajan, deputy commissioner of the Surat Municipal Corporation, said achieving the certification would help Surat create a green image, and attract best practices and technologies from developed countries.  But first it needs to iron out a few \u201chitches\u201d, he said, particularly around data on greenhouse gas emissions, which is outdated, and on equity, which is not methodically researched for Indian cities.  The data element is also critical for Savona in Italy, another city undergoing LEED certification.   Mayor Ilaria\u00a0Caprioglio said the short-term goal is to gather data providing a detailed overview of Savona\u2019s levels of sustainability, which can then inform future decisions.   Savona, a town of 62,000 in the country\u2019s northwest, is an important port for Mediterranean cruise lines, and it is now in the midst of a multi-year agreement to bolster sustainable development in the cruise industry.  \u201cOur aim is to give the new generations an increasingly green, smart and environmentally friendly city,\u201d Caprioglio said.

          "body": "WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On a work day, the U.S. capital does not appear much more \u201csustainable\u201d than any other major city. Its streets are packed with cars, lights flicker in offices long after the occupants have gone home, and stark economic divides persist between neighborhoods.  But beneath the surface, something is working in Washington, D.C., experts say.  In August, the city was the first to receive the top \u201cplatinum\u201d certification under a global sustainability program called LEED for Cities, which tracks performance on energy use, waste management, water, transport and even quality of life.   Washington was joined by Phoenix in December.   The LEED for Cities framework, which celebrated its first birthday last month, is an expansion of the world\u2019s most widely used rating system for green buildings.

          "title": "Column: New tax laws may kill the beach house dream",
          "body": " CHICAGO (Reuters) - Dreaming of a beach house? You might want to think twice about that, given tax changes that just kicked in will make owning a vacation home more costly and may tank the resale value of the second-home market.  Prices could drop about 10 percent in some markets, said Zillow (www.zillow.com) economist Aaron Terrazas, with pricey coastal areas the most vulnerable.\u00a0This will not be good news for owners in popular areas who have already been waiting a decade for prices to recover the value lost during the housing crash and recession.  After the 2006 housing peak, prices dropped more than 50 percent in many popular vacation areas, and remain far off those highs. Zillow data indicates homes in Fort Myers, Florida remain 24 percent below the pre-crash peak, and Ocean City, New Jersey is still down 19 percent despite the draw of beach communities.\u00a0Overall, purchases have been declining for three years.  Researchers from Gallup Inc to the Urban Institute have traced slower home buying to multiple factors \u2013 from difficulty getting mortgages to the uncertainty that an expensive investment would appreciate enough to make a purchase worthwhile.  The new tax rules will have a big impact because many second-home buyers are middle-income households, not the super rich, and even a shift of a few thousand dollars can greatly affect affordability. The median buyer\u2019s household income in 2016 was $89,900, and only 34 percent of buyers had household incomes over $100,000, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Almost three-quarters used mortgage financing.  While second homeowners can still deduct the interest on new mortgages up to $750,000, experts predict that many people will no longer itemize their expenses on Schedule A. The new tax rules raise the standard deduction to $24,000 for a married couple, and this may be too high a threshold for many people to reach without being able to claim more than $10,000 in combined property and other state and local taxes.  Also, homeowners can no longer deduct interest on home equity loans. That is likely to hold back vacation home buying because many people use home equity on their main residence to purchase additional homes, said Zillow\u2019s Terrazas.  When homeowners think about the long-term impact on their finances, the math becomes even trickier. People are looking at vacation homes as longer-term commitments than in the past, with the average buyer planning to own the home nine years compared with five years in 2015, NAR reported.\u00a0  As baby boomers think about future retirement, some are buying vacation properties while still working and use them occasionally as a retreat.\u00a0Eventually, 18 percent plan to turn those second homes into homes for retirement.  The only way to afford this in the future may be to become a landlord.  If an individual turns their vacation home into a rental property and uses a business tax structure such as a limited liability company or C Corporation, they will be able to deduct mortgage interest and property taxes as a business expense, said Cliff Johnson, co-founder of Vacasa, which manages vacation homes.  Such an approach is not for everyone, however, and generally requires attention to tax details. For one thing, when you decide to sell the property as a business you may have to pay more in capital gains taxes if the home has appreciated in value, said Alison Flores, researcher for the H&R Block Tax Institute.  Some individuals could get around this making the property qualify as a private residence again by moving back in prior to the sale.  Owners can still use their vacation home for personal use and rent it out, if they keep records of the usage. Expenses can be deducted, but income is also taxable if you rent out a home for more than 14 days.  Then there is the hassle factor, which can be hard to calculate. According to NAR research, 15 percent of people who tried renting out their vacation homes decided they would not do it again.  \u201cPeople might have bought the property to relax,\u201d said Vacasa\u2019s Johnson.\u00a0\u201cBut one or two years later they may realize they never relaxed.\u201d  Editing by Beth Pinsker and Andrew Hay"

          "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Beijing\u2019s crackdown on pollution has put China on track to overtake Japan this year as the world\u2019s biggest importer of natural gas, used to replace dirtier coal.  China - already the biggest importer of oil and coal - is the world\u2019s third biggest user of natural gas behind the United States and Russia, but has to import around 40 percent of its total needs as domestic production can\u2019t keep up with demand.  Data compiled from the Thomson Reuters Eikon terminal indicates China\u2019s 2017 imports of pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) will top 67 million tonnes, up by more than a quarter from a year earlier. LNG imports alone surged more than 50 percent.  The data, which includes LNG tanker arrivals to China and pipeline monthly import flow estimates, is preliminary as December figures are not yet available.  China still lags Japan, with gas annual imports of around 83.5 million tonnes, all as LNG, but its overall gas imports topped Japan\u2019s in September and again in November, government data and shipping flows show.  Analysts say the trend is set and China should top Japan for the full year in 2018.  \u201cBoth LNG and pipeline imports will continue to increase in the next few years. We expect China to overtake Japan as the world\u2019s largest gas importer in 2018,\u201d said Miaoru Huang, Asia gas and LNG senior manager at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  \u201cBut Japan will remain as the No.1 LNG importer till around 2028,\u201d she added.     China last year started to move millions of households and many industrial facilities from coal to gas as part of efforts to clean its skies, sparking an unprecedented rally in overseas import orders.  China\u2019s three biggest LNG suppliers are Australia, Qatar and Malaysia, while pipeline imports come from Central Asia and Myanmar. A pipeline connecting China to Russia is under construction.  Unlike established LNG importers which import the bulk of their cargoes under long-term contracts with fixed monthly volumes and a link to the oil market, many Chinese utilities buy LNG in the spot market when they need it at short notice, such as the current peak demand winter season.  As a result, Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have more than doubled since June to $11.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their highest since November 2014, making LNG one of 2017\u2019s strongest performing commodities.  China\u2019s surging demand already pushed it past South Korea in 2017 as the world\u2019s number 2 LNG importer.  Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin"

          "body": "BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Economics student Mutassim al-Misrati lost his leg in an RPG attack in April 2014 while fighting in Benghazi, his home city.           Back then Misrati had joined the forces that were beginning to coalesce around Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, who weeks later would launch a campaign to take control of Benghazi, Libya\u2019s second city.  Haftar, now the dominant figure in eastern Libya and a likely candidate in elections that may happen by the end of the year, finally declared victory in Benghazi in July 2017, though fighting continued in one area of the city until last week.  The win has come at the cost of thousands of dead and many more wounded who receive little care.  Since 2014, Libya has been split between rival military factions and governments, causing an economic decline and collapse in health services that have left many veterans to fend largely for themselves.  Misrati received medical care the year he was wounded, and has a prosthetic leg that allowed him to return to studying for an economics degree and working at a fish market.  \u201cIn 2014, I received care but at the present moment in time there is neglect when it comes to all of those wounded,\u201d Misrati said.   He is still a supporter of Haftar, whose campaign in Benghazi, \u201cOperation Dignity\u201d, battled Islamists and other opponents, some of them former rebels who had fought to topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.   \u201cI fought and dedicated myself to my country. Thank God, I was spared and now I am back with my work and my people,\u201d Misrati said.  \u201cThere are amputees who have not received prosthetic legs, though some received prosthetics. Some are able to run, just like I am able to run, and to live.\u201d  There are no independent estimates for overall casualties from the conflict in Benghazi, though Ahmed al-Mismari, a spokesman for Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army (LNA), said about 6,000 of their men had died.   The LNA special forces, which played a leading role in the fighting, lost about 1,500 men and had some 2,500 wounded, said Colonel Milad al-Zawi, a spokesman.   Veterans get a one-off payment of 2,000 dinars, currently the equivalent of just $225 at black market rates that set the price of many goods in Libya. Though foreign governments have flown some wounded fighters abroad for treatment, seeking medical treatment outside the country has become prohibitively expensive for most.   In Benghazi, daily struggles with liquidity shortages and inflation have dampened hopes brought by an end to the fighting.  \u201cBenghazi is full of the blood of martyrs,\u201d said Misrati. \u201cIt wants the nation to be at rest, it wants cash, it wants uncrowded bakeries, petrol, electricity.\u201d   Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky"

          "body": "* Group has criticised company strategy  * Bigger stake gives it right to call for general meetings  * Opposes CEZ financing all of Czech nuclear expansion (Adds CEZ comment)  By Petra Vodstrcilova  PRAGUE, Jan 3 (Reuters) - A group of minority shareholders in Czech power utility CEZ that is critical of company strategy has built a more than 1 percent stake, giving it the ability to more aggressively defend its interests, a representative of the group said.  Michal Snobr, an investor and long-time critic of CEZ\u2019s management and policies, told an investor conference on Wednesday that the group had reached qualified shareholder status, which allows it to call for general meetings and gives it other rights.  The group criticised a cut in CEZ\u2019s dividend payout last year and is opposed to CEZ financing on its own the Czech Republic\u2019s plans to expand its nuclear power capacity.  The country is debating how to fund nuclear power expansion but the government has so far refused to provide any support to 70 percent state-owned CEZ, such as price guarantees, for the construction of reactors.  New Prime Minister Andrej Babis has said CEZ itself could finance the expansion, an option opposed by Snobr.  \u201cIn the position of a qualified shareholder we will have enough tools to defend against such things,\u201d Snobr said.  CTK news agency reported that the group would seek an extraordinary general meeting in the first half of this year, before the annual general meeting, to address the issue of financing nuclear power expansion.  \u201cEvery shareholder has a right under law... to defend their interests,\u201d CEZ spokesman Ladislav Kriz said.  CEZ last year cut its dividend payout, although Snobr said CEZ had a high cashflow and could have maintained its dividend at past levels.  CEZ shares have risen 17.7 percent in the past year to around two-year highs as investors see it benefiting in the coming years from a recovery in power prices.  Wholesale power prices have rebounded in recent months, but CEZ has not yet benefited as it hedges future sales.  The company has forecast full-year profit will fall to 19 billion crowns ($893 million) in 2017, from 19.6 billion in 2016.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Sangamo Therapeutics Inc and Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday they would work together to develop a gene therapy to treat ALS, a disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.  The gene therapy will also be used to treat patients with a brain disorder caused by mutations of a gene that is linked to about a third of hereditary ALS cases.  The partnership comes at a time when gene therapy is gaining momentum, after several high profile failures in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently updating guidance to help speed up development of such treatments.  The agency last month approved Spark Therapeutics Inc\u2019s treatment for a rare form of blindness, marking the first approval of a gene therapy for an inherited disease.  Under the terms of the deal, Sangamo will receive a $12 million upfront payment from Pfizer and an additional $150 million in milestone payments, the companies said.  ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), whose sufferers include renowned British physicist Stephen Hawking, attracted international attention in 2014 with the \u201cIce Bucket Challenge\u201d, in which people posted videos of pouring ice-cold water on themselves to encourage donations to research.  Shares of Sangamo were up 5.4 percent at $18.50, while those of Pfizer were up marginally before the bell on Wednesday.

          "body": "ST MORITZ, Switzerland (Reuters) - Widely seen as Switzerland\u2019s great hope for a skiing gold at the 2018 Games, Lara Gut is still struggling to regain race fitness after suffering a knee injury a year ago.  The 26-year-old, who in 2016 became the first Swiss woman to win the overall World Cup since Vreni Schneider in 1995, made a quicker than expected return from surgery when she raced at Soelden at the end of October.  But she admitted recently that her race-winning instincts have yet to return and she has managed only one podium finish, a second place in the Super G at Lake Louise.  \u201cThe good turns don\u2019t come as automatically and naturally as they did before,\u201d she said after finishing fourth in a Super G at Val d\u2019Isere last month.  Gut, a specialist in the speed events, has already suffered Olympic frustration when she was forced to miss the Vancouver Games in 2010 due to a slow recovery from a dislocated hip.  She reached Sochi four years later in peak condition but had to be content with a bronze in the downhill, won jointly by Tina Maze of Slovenia and Gut\u2019s compatriot Dominique Gisin, and was fourth in the Super G.  Gold medals have also eluded her at the world championships where she has won three silvers and two bronze.  Born in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, Gut was coached from the start of her career by her father Pauli.  She took part in her first World Cup race at Lienz in December 2007 and finished on the podium in her first World Cup downhill at St Moritz two months later.  The first of her 23 World Cup wins also came at St Moritz the following December when she won the Super G.  After winning silver medals in the Super G and combined events at the 2009 world championships in Val d\u2019Isere, she missed the whole of the 2009/10 season through injury.  Her career really began to blossom in 2013/14 when she won seven World Cup races, followed by two the following season and six in 2015/16, the year she took the overall title.  Her dreams of a gold at last year\u2019s world championships in St Moritz \u2014 previously a happy hunting-ground \u2014 were shattered when he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament while training for the slalom part of the combined event.  But Gut said the recovery gave her some much-needed time for reflection.  \u201cI learned the importance of being at peace with oneself during those six months,\u201d she said before her comeback race at Soelden.  \u201cIt\u2019s always been my greatest challenge finding a balance between what I have to do and what is good for me.\u201d  \u201cI devoted too much time for Lara the athlete and I forgot about Lara the person.\u201d  Editing by Greg Stutchbury"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is sticking doggedly to its plan to cut commercial oil inventories down to the five-year average to rebalance the oil market.  But in doing so, the organization risks tightening the market too much, sending prices sharply higher and encouraging a faster-than-expected acceleration in production from U.S. shale producers.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister, who is the organization\u2019s de facto leader, has reiterated that stocks are still around 150 million barrels too high and it would be premature to discuss an exit strategy or change of course.  \u201cAlmost the single metric we look at is global inventories and of course the most transparent and trustworthy is the OECD,\u201d he said in an interview before Christmas (\u201cSaudi energy minister Q&A with Reuters\u201d, Dec. 20).  OPEC, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) all have slightly different figures for OECD commercial crude and products stocks, but they show a similar trend.  OPEC estimates that total stocks were around 137 million barrels higher than the five-year average in October, down by around half since May (\u201cMonthly Oil Market Report\u201d, OPEC, December 2017).  IEA puts commercial stocks about 111 million barrels above the prior five-year average at the end of October (\u201cOil Market Report\u201d, IEA, December 2017).  EIA data shows commercial stocks 167 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average at the end of October, down from a surplus of 380 million barrels in July 2016 (tmsnrt.rs/2CgLBYl).  While the specific numbers differ, mostly for definitional and methodological reasons, the data from each of the agencies shows the stock overhang compared with the five-year average has narrowed significantly.  Most of the remaining overhang is concentrated in crude oil rather than refined products such as gasoline and heating oil.  Product inventories are already tight in some cases, notably for middle distillates such as gasoil, diesel fuel and heating oil.  OPEC seems determined to drive total stocks down to the five-year average, or very close to it, before starting to increase its own output.  But that would almost certainly leave stockpiles uncomfortably low, send benchmark Brent prices well above $70 per barrel and push the market into a big backwardation.  Global oil consumption has increased by more 6 million barrels per day over the last five years, according to the EIA.  Other things equal, the oil industry will want to carry significantly higher stocks in 2018 than in 2013 to cover the increase in consumption.  Brent futures prices for the next six months are already trading in a backwardation of around $2 per barrel, which is consistent with a market that is already tight and undersupplied.  The six-month Brent calendar spread is trading around the 78th percentile of its historical range, up from the 22nd percentile at the same point last year.  The calendar spread is watched by many physical traders as the most reliable indicator of the balance between production, consumption and inventories.  Backwardation is normally associated with a market that is undersupplied and a low and declining level of inventories, while contango is normally associated with oversupply and high/rising stocks.  The Brent market has cycled regularly between backwardation and contango over the last 25 years as it moves between periods of under- and oversupply.  The sustained shift from contango in 2015/16 to backwardation in late 2017 and at the start of 2018 strongly suggests the market has switched from oversupply to undersupply.  Calendar spreads for all months in 2018 have tightened significantly over the last six months suggesting traders see the market moving towards a sustained period of undersupply.  Most forecasters, including the IEA and OPEC, predict the oil market will be in a small surplus during the first half of 2018, followed by a deficit in the second.  The expected rise in stocks during the first half is one reason why OPEC and its allies think market rebalancing will not be completed until later in the year and agreed to keep their output unchanged.  But a seasonal increase in stocks is normal during the first six months, which includes the principal maintenance period for many refineries.  Later in the year, the summer driving season in the United States and winter heating season in the northern hemisphere typically boost consumption in the second half.  Increasing crude stocks during the first half of 2018 would only signify a weakening market if stocks rise faster than normal.  History suggests that OPEC will gamble on tightening the market too much, with prices overshooting on the upside, rather than risk not tightening it enough and prices fall back.  After the past two oil market slumps, in 1997/98 and 2008/09, prices subsequently overshot the organization\u2019s formal and informal targets of $28 and $75 per barrel respectively.  Front-month Brent futures prices reached almost $35 per barrel in late 2000 and more than $125 per barrel in early 2011.  The six-month calendar spread hit about $4.50 per barrel backwardation in both cases before starting to ease lower.  OPEC has not declared a price target for 2018, though some senior officials from member countries have briefed they want to see a Brent price floor of $60, which implies an annual average well above this.  In the past, OPEC members have tended to revise their price targets upwards as market prices rise, in a ratchet effect.  Re-running history, informal price targets, as implied in statements made by officials from OPEC members, have already risen significantly since the start of 2017.  Most OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, want to see higher oil prices to boost revenues and close their budget and current account deficits.  Saudi Arabia also needs higher prices to finance its ambitious social and economic transformation program and create positive sentiment around the planned sale of shares in its national oil company.  In practice, if OPEC comes anywhere near achieving its objective of draining stocks down to the five-year average level, prices will likely end up well above $70, which will probably be welcomed by most OPEC members.  But the more prices increase, especially with Brent prices near $70, and WTI prices above $60, the more likely U.S. shale drilling and production rates will accelerate, which will tend to frustrate the objective of lowering stocks.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Sangamo Therapeutics Inc and Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday they would work together to develop a gene therapy to treat ALS, a disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord.  The gene therapy will also be used to treat patients with a brain disorder caused by mutations of a gene that is linked to about a third of hereditary ALS cases.  The partnership comes at a time when gene therapy is gaining momentum, after several high profile failures in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently updating guidance to help speed up development of such treatments.  The agency last month approved Spark Therapeutics Inc\u2019s treatment for a rare form of blindness, marking the first approval of a gene therapy for an inherited disease.  Under the terms of the deal, Sangamo will receive a $12 million upfront payment from Pfizer and an additional $150 million in milestone payments, the companies said.  ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), whose sufferers include renowned British physicist Stephen Hawking, attracted international attention in 2014 with the \u201cIce Bucket Challenge\u201d, in which people posted videos of pouring ice-cold water on themselves to encourage donations to research.  Shares of Sangamo were up 5.4 percent at $18.50, while those of Pfizer were up marginally before the bell on Wednesday.

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Lindsey Vonn has vowed not to take the safe option at what are likely to be her last Winter Olympics next month despite being dogged by questions about her health after recent crashes.  The 33-year-old American is the most successful World Cup women\u2019s skier of all time with 78 victories while clinching four overall titles, but has only two Olympic medals \u2014 a gold in downhill and bronze in super-G, both won in Vancouver in 2010.  In recent competitions, however, Vonn has seen a mix of crashes and wins, making her chances in Pyeongchang difficult to handicap.    In early December she crashed twice at Canada\u2019s Lake Louise, where she has a long history of success, before racing to a super-G World Cup win at Val d\u2019Isere in France two weeks later.  \u201cAs long as I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m confident, then I\u2019ll be in a great position when I get to Pyeongchang,\u201d she told the Vail Daily in November.  \u201cEveryone asks me if I\u2019m afraid, after so many crashes do I take my foot off the gas pedal? And while I am smarter and I try to manage my risk better than I have in the past, it\u2019s still ski racing.  \u201cYou can try to manage risk as much as you want, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s a dangerous sport.\u201d  Managing risk has been on her mind for the past four years after she missed the 2014 Sochi Olympics due to a right knee injury.  It was arguably the most serious of a career that had been relatively injury free during her first decade as a professional as she became a household name for her exploits on the slopes and off them, courtesy of a high-profile relationship with golfer Tiger Woods.   Since the February 2013 crash that contributed to her missing the Sochi Games she has endured a series of setbacks that include multiple broken bones, surgeries and grueling rehabilitations.  \u201cI\u2019m 33, I\u2019ve been injured quite a few times, but my passion for the sport has never changed,\u201d she said.   \u201cSince I started skiing and started racing when I was eight years old, I\u2019ve loved what I do, and I don\u2019t want to stop doing it.   \u201cAs long as I\u2019m enjoying it and I don\u2019t have to use too much duct tape to hold my body together, I\u2019m good.  \u201cI\u2019m focused on winning the World Cups, but just getting to February healthy is the only thing I should be really focused on.\u201d  Editing by Greg Stutchbury"

          "body": "PARIS (Reuters) - A majority of French people would favor allowing surrogate motherhood, though primarily only for medical reasons, a poll showed on Wednesday, highlighting a shift in attitudes as France prepares to review laws relating to assisted reproduction.  All forms of surrogacy, where a woman gives birth to a child on behalf of someone else, are banned in France, as in several other European countries such as Germany. Some countries like the United Kingdom allow for altruistic surrogacies, not commercial ones.  The French government will launch a debate on a new bioethics legislative pact this year, which could see medically assisted reproduction extended to female gay couples and single women, a stance favored by President Emmanuel Macron.  He opposes introducing surrogate motherhood, however.  Until recently public opinion was also against surrogacy, but the poll by Ifop, published in La Croix, a Catholic newspaper, found that 62% of French people were now in favor of it.  Of those, 46% would only back surrogate motherhood if there were medical reasons to do so, while 18% said they supported it in all circumstances.  In a similar poll last September, 52% of French people rejected surrogacy under any form, versus 36% now.  France\u2019s previous Socialist government legalized same-sex marriage in 2013, drawing a strong unexpectedly show of opposition in the run-up to the law from conservatives, especially Roman Catholics, and large street protests.  France\u2019s highest court has since made it easier for children born through surrogacy abroad to a same-sex couple to be recognized as citizens and adopted by the partner of the child\u2019s biological father."

          "body": "ST MORITZ, Switzerland (Reuters) - Widely seen as Switzerland\u2019s great hope for a skiing gold at the 2018 Games, Lara Gut is still struggling to regain race fitness after suffering a knee injury a year ago.  The 26-year-old, who in 2016 became the first Swiss woman to win the overall World Cup since Vreni Schneider in 1995, made a quicker than expected return from surgery when she raced at Soelden at the end of October.  But she admitted recently that her race-winning instincts have yet to return and she has managed only one podium finish, a second place in the Super G at Lake Louise.  \u201cThe good turns don\u2019t come as automatically and naturally as they did before,\u201d she said after finishing fourth in a Super G at Val d\u2019Isere last month.  Gut, a specialist in the speed events, has already suffered Olympic frustration when she was forced to miss the Vancouver Games in 2010 due to a slow recovery from a dislocated hip.  She reached Sochi four years later in peak condition but had to be content with a bronze in the downhill, won jointly by Tina Maze of Slovenia and Gut\u2019s compatriot Dominique Gisin, and was fourth in the Super G.  Gold medals have also eluded her at the world championships where she has won three silvers and two bronze.  Born in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, Gut was coached from the start of her career by her father Pauli.  She took part in her first World Cup race at Lienz in December 2007 and finished on the podium in her first World Cup downhill at St Moritz two months later.  The first of her 23 World Cup wins also came at St Moritz the following December when she won the Super G.  After winning silver medals in the Super G and combined events at the 2009 world championships in Val d\u2019Isere, she missed the whole of the 2009/10 season through injury.  Her career really began to blossom in 2013/14 when she won seven World Cup races, followed by two the following season and six in 2015/16, the year she took the overall title.  Her dreams of a gold at last year\u2019s world championships in St Moritz \u2014 previously a happy hunting-ground \u2014 were shattered when he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament while training for the slalom part of the combined event.  But Gut said the recovery gave her some much-needed time for reflection.  \u201cI learned the importance of being at peace with oneself during those six months,\u201d she said before her comeback race at Soelden.  \u201cIt\u2019s always been my greatest challenge finding a balance between what I have to do and what is good for me.\u201d  \u201cI devoted too much time for Lara the athlete and I forgot about Lara the person.\u201d  Editing by Greg Stutchbury"

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - American Mikaela Shiffrin relishes the opportunity to be a multiple-medal threat at the Olympics in Pyeongchang next month and is brimming with confidence after a dominant run through World Cup events in the lead up to the Games.  The 22-year-old Alpine ski racer heads to her second Olympic Games oozing with confidence after notching 37 World Cup wins, including the first ever in downhill late last year which stunned the skiing world.   Her torrid pace at World Cup events puts her on track to top Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark\u2019s all-time record of 86 wins.   But the slalom specialist will soon be ready to shift her focus from racking up World Cup wins to claiming medals on the sport\u2019s biggest stage.  In a statement that should strike fear into the hearts of her competitors, she told Reuters that she was a better skiier now than she was when the then 18-year-old from Colorado won gold in slalom in Sochi, becoming the youngest women\u2019s slalom champion in Olympic history.  \u201cBeing four years older I feel like I have more experience and knowledge under my belt,\u201d she said.  \u201cBut especially since I have improved my skiing a lot since Sochi and I have had more success in events other than slalom, I feel like I\u2019m going into Pyeongchang with the unique opportunity to be a multiple event medal threat, which is super cool.\u201d  Despite her success in downhill, where she earned her maiden World Cup victory in the discipline at Canada\u2019s Lake Louise in early December, she is resisting the urge to stretch herself too thin in South Korea.  \u201cRight now I am planning slalom, giant slalom, Alpine combined, and Super-G,\u201d she said.   \u201cBut that is tentative and always subject to change,\u201d she said, adding that she will finalize her program closer to the Games.   Tom Kelly, vice president of communications at U.S. Ski & Snowboard, reckoned what separated Shiffrin from the rest of the field was her complete devotion to the sport.  \u201cShe is an amazing human being,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cShe is a very unique individual and the passion that she has for this sport is really unmatched.\u201d   Shiffrin\u2019s confidence also comes from knowing that her tight-knit family, which includes her ski racing parents Eileen and Jeff, will have her back no matter how she performs in Pyeongchang.  \u201cI think there are huge advantages of having such a close and supportive family,\u201d she said.   \u201cFirst and foremost the fact that I know they are always looking out for my best interest and even if I come up short of my goals they will love me anyway.\u201d   The Olympics will run from Feb. 9 to Feb. 25.

          "title": "Markets take EU's new financial rules in their stride",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The rollout of new rules on Wednesday that aim to make European Union financial markets safer and more transparent has been glitch-free so far, though disruptions cannot be ruled out, the EU\u2019s markets watchdog said.  The new regime shines a spotlight on the inner workings of stock, bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to provide detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions.     Big banks spent an estimated $2 billion collectively last year to upgrade IT systems to prepare.  \u201cWhat we can see for our part, is no glitches so far,\u201d Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), told reporters.  \u201cIt will be the first time we have a complete overview of all financial instruments in the EU.\u201d  European stock and bond volumes were light in early trading.  \u201cSo far [there is] no difference compared to a regular day,\u201d said Markus Huber, a trader at City of London Markets.   \u201cVolume isn\u2019t expected to be massive or back to normal either due to not everybody being back from holidays, and not much going on in regard to major news or economic data.\u201d  Fixed income volumes were lower at 1000 GMT compared with their average at that time over the previous 30 days, according to data provider Trax, a subsidiary of MarketAxess that tracks around 65 percent of all secondary market bond deals.  Sterling corporate bond volumes were 46 percent lower than their 30-day average, with euro sovereign bond volumes 24 percent lower and sterling sovereign bond volumes 11 percent lower. Euro corporate bond volumes were 2 percent higher, according to Trax.  The new rules, known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), were delayed by a year to give banks, asset managers and exchanges more time to get ready.  Harps Sidhu, head of capital markets at consultants KPMG, said it would become clearer by the end of the week if transaction reporting was working properly.  \u201cThe key thing to realize is MiFID II isn\u2019t done. People are at various stages of readiness, which I think everyone accepts,\u201d Sidhu said.  Market nerves were eased by ESMA announcing measures just before Christmas to give companies more time to comply with some key requirements.  Regulators have said they will not crack down on poor compliance initially, as long as market participants show they are doing everything they can to get up to speed.  Maijoor said given the complexity and size of the reform, ESMA glitches could not be ruled out in coming days or weeks.  Regulators in Britain and Germany intervened just hours before MiFID went live to give three clearing houses an exemption from having to give customers more choice over where to clear some of their derivative contracts.  ICE Futures Europe (ICE.N), London Metal Exchange (0388.HK) and Eurex Clearing (DB1Gn.DE) were granted exemptions until July 2020 from opening themselves up to more competition.  Maijoor said this would be a \u201cone-off\u201d waiver and the new requirements for clearing houses would come into effect in 2020.  Alexandra Hachmeister, chief regulatory officer at Deutsche Boerse, said the waiver was needed for its Eurex arm because it was unclear how Britain\u2019s financial market will look once the UK has left the EU in 2019.  \u201cThat means that access provisions need to be thought about in an uncertain legal and regulatory environment,\u201d Hachmeister told CNBC news channel.  One of MiFID II\u2019s main objectives is to shift trading in stocks, bonds and derivatives from private venues called \u201cdark pools\u201d to \u201clit\u201d markets where everyone in the market can see the prices being offered.  A trader at one of Europe\u2019s largest inter-dealer brokers, which help investment banks trade with each other, said it had seen an increase in volumes on its public trading platforms on Wednesday as activity moved from dark pools.   \u201cOn the trading side, it seems that the exchanges benefit at the expense of these off-exchange markets,\u201d said Martin Van Vliet, a rates strategist at ING.  The rules also require that fund managers pay for research provided by investment analysts, a change that could lead to a fall in the number of reports that pour daily into professional investors\u2019 inboxes.    A fund manager at one of Europe\u2019s largest asset managers said he had received around a third fewer research reports compared with Tuesday.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is sticking doggedly to its plan to cut commercial oil inventories down to the five-year average to rebalance the oil market.  But in doing so, the organization risks tightening the market too much, sending prices sharply higher and encouraging a faster-than-expected acceleration in production from U.S. shale producers.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister, who is the organization\u2019s de facto leader, has reiterated that stocks are still around 150 million barrels too high and it would be premature to discuss an exit strategy or change of course.  \u201cAlmost the single metric we look at is global inventories and of course the most transparent and trustworthy is the OECD,\u201d he said in an interview before Christmas (\u201cSaudi energy minister Q&A with Reuters\u201d, Dec. 20).  OPEC, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) all have slightly different figures for OECD commercial crude and products stocks, but they show a similar trend.  OPEC estimates that total stocks were around 137 million barrels higher than the five-year average in October, down by around half since May (\u201cMonthly Oil Market Report\u201d, OPEC, December 2017).  IEA puts commercial stocks about 111 million barrels above the prior five-year average at the end of October (\u201cOil Market Report\u201d, IEA, December 2017).  EIA data shows commercial stocks 167 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average at the end of October, down from a surplus of 380 million barrels in July 2016 (tmsnrt.rs/2CgLBYl).  While the specific numbers differ, mostly for definitional and methodological reasons, the data from each of the agencies shows the stock overhang compared with the five-year average has narrowed significantly.  Most of the remaining overhang is concentrated in crude oil rather than refined products such as gasoline and heating oil.  Product inventories are already tight in some cases, notably for middle distillates such as gasoil, diesel fuel and heating oil.  OPEC seems determined to drive total stocks down to the five-year average, or very close to it, before starting to increase its own output.  But that would almost certainly leave stockpiles uncomfortably low, send benchmark Brent prices well above $70 per barrel and push the market into a big backwardation.  Global oil consumption has increased by more 6 million barrels per day over the last five years, according to the EIA.  Other things equal, the oil industry will want to carry significantly higher stocks in 2018 than in 2013 to cover the increase in consumption.  Brent futures prices for the next six months are already trading in a backwardation of around $2 per barrel, which is consistent with a market that is already tight and undersupplied.  The six-month Brent calendar spread is trading around the 78th percentile of its historical range, up from the 22nd percentile at the same point last year.  The calendar spread is watched by many physical traders as the most reliable indicator of the balance between production, consumption and inventories.  Backwardation is normally associated with a market that is undersupplied and a low and declining level of inventories, while contango is normally associated with oversupply and high/rising stocks.  The Brent market has cycled regularly between backwardation and contango over the last 25 years as it moves between periods of under- and oversupply.  The sustained shift from contango in 2015/16 to backwardation in late 2017 and at the start of 2018 strongly suggests the market has switched from oversupply to undersupply.  Calendar spreads for all months in 2018 have tightened significantly over the last six months suggesting traders see the market moving towards a sustained period of undersupply.  Most forecasters, including the IEA and OPEC, predict the oil market will be in a small surplus during the first half of 2018, followed by a deficit in the second.  The expected rise in stocks during the first half is one reason why OPEC and its allies think market rebalancing will not be completed until later in the year and agreed to keep their output unchanged.  But a seasonal increase in stocks is normal during the first six months, which includes the principal maintenance period for many refineries.  Later in the year, the summer driving season in the United States and winter heating season in the northern hemisphere typically boost consumption in the second half.  Increasing crude stocks during the first half of 2018 would only signify a weakening market if stocks rise faster than normal.  History suggests that OPEC will gamble on tightening the market too much, with prices overshooting on the upside, rather than risk not tightening it enough and prices fall back.  After the past two oil market slumps, in 1997/98 and 2008/09, prices subsequently overshot the organization\u2019s formal and informal targets of $28 and $75 per barrel respectively.  Front-month Brent futures prices reached almost $35 per barrel in late 2000 and more than $125 per barrel in early 2011.  The six-month calendar spread hit about $4.50 per barrel backwardation in both cases before starting to ease lower.  OPEC has not declared a price target for 2018, though some senior officials from member countries have briefed they want to see a Brent price floor of $60, which implies an annual average well above this.  In the past, OPEC members have tended to revise their price targets upwards as market prices rise, in a ratchet effect.  Re-running history, informal price targets, as implied in statements made by officials from OPEC members, have already risen significantly since the start of 2017.  Most OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, want to see higher oil prices to boost revenues and close their budget and current account deficits.  Saudi Arabia also needs higher prices to finance its ambitious social and economic transformation program and create positive sentiment around the planned sale of shares in its national oil company.  In practice, if OPEC comes anywhere near achieving its objective of draining stocks down to the five-year average level, prices will likely end up well above $70, which will probably be welcomed by most OPEC members.  But the more prices increase, especially with Brent prices near $70, and WTI prices above $60, the more likely U.S. shale drilling and production rates will accelerate, which will tend to frustrate the objective of lowering stocks.

After its biggest one-day gain in more than two weeks on Tuesday, and in the wake of its best year since 2009 in 2017, MSCI\u2019s index of global stocks, which tracks shares in 47 countries, pushed on to new record highs.  The pan-European stock index was 0.2 percent higher following gains for their Asian and U.S. counterparts overnight as manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy. U.S. stock futures suggested another higher open on Wednesday.  The single currency was holding near a four-month high of $1.2081 hit on Tuesday.  \u201cInvestors have woken up in the new year and looked forward to another firm year for global growth with very muted downside risk,\u201d said Investec economist Philip Shaw. But he warned against reading too much into the first two trading days of the new year.  \u201cThe converse is the sell-off in bond markets: the idea that inflation pressures may be firmer than expected and central banks could take a slightly more aggressive approach than previously thought,\u201d Shaw added.  ECB rate-setter Ewald Nowotny told a German newspaper that the European Central Bank may end its stimulus programme this year if the euro zone economy continues to grow strongly.  Earlier in the session, Asian stocks struck a range of new peaks: a record high for Philippine stocks, a 24-year top for Thailand and a decade-high for Hong Kong.  MSCI\u2019s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4 percent, having jumped 1.4 percent on Tuesday in its best performance since last March.  This came after Wall Street started the new year as it ended the old, scoring another set of record closing peaks. The Dow rose 0.42 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.83 percent and the Nasdaq 1.5 percent.  The gains in riskier assets came as industry surveys from India to Germany to Canada showed quickening activity.  \u201cThe breadth of the recovery is extraordinary,\u201d said Deutsche Bank macro strategist Alan Ruskin, noting that of 31 countries covered, only three failed to show growth while all the largest manufacturing sectors improved.  Elsewhere, spot gold reached its highest since mid-September at $1,321.33, before edging back to $1,317.32 per ounce.  Oil prices surged again, inching towards 2-1/2 year highs hit on Tuesday as strong demand and ongoing efforts led by OPEC and Russia to curb production tightened the market.  Brent crude futures was up 0.6 percent at $67 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures shot up 0.8 percent to $60.87 a barrel.

          "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Vietnamese tycoon detained in Singapore has concerns for his well-being because of \u201cinternal politics\u201d in his home country, where he says he served as a senior intelligence officer, one of his lawyers told Reuters on Wednesday.  Property developer Phan Van Anh Vu, 42, is wanted in Vietnam for revealing state secrets, media say. He was detained in Singapore last week as he tried to leave for Malaysia.  Serious security offences such as revealing state secrets can carry the death penalty in Vietnam.  His case adds a new international dimension to a Vietnamese corruption crackdown that has led to the arrest of dozens of officials and business figures and is entangled with political intrigue in the single-party communist state.  \u201cHe said he has well-founded concerns for his well-being. They relate to internal Vietnamese politics,\u201d said Remy Choo, one of at least three lawyers representing Vu, adding that his client said he was formerly a senior intelligence officer in Vietnam.   After meeting Vu for the first time on Wednesday, Choo said his client did not know why he had been detained in Singapore, believed he had valid travel documents and wanted to travel to Germany.   Singapore\u2019s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, which has the power to repatriate people under certain circumstances, said Vu was arrested on Dec. 28 for committing offences under the Immigration Act.  Vu\u2019s lawyers have applied to Germany to grant him passage. One lawyer said his rank in the secret service meant he could give details of an operation in which Germany says a Vietnamese oil executive was kidnapped in a Berlin park last summer and bundled home to face trial.  His lawyers have written to Singapore immigration authorities and filed a application to Singapore\u2019s High Court to try to find out why Vu was detained.   A date has been set for a court hearing on Jan 18, one of his lawyers said.  Reporting by John Geddie; Editing by Paul Tait and Nick Macfie"

The proceeds from the offering will be used for project construction. The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 12 December 2017 and follows the receipt of documents conforming to information previously received.

The bonds will rank at all times pari passu with all present and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of SCID.

          "body": "* Next beats guidance for Christmas sales  * Upgrades full-year profit forecast  * Online sales compensate for decline in stores  * Next leads charge as retail shares rise (Adds detail, CEO, analyst comment, John Lewis numbers, updates shares)  By James Davey  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - British clothing chain Next reported better-than-expected Christmas sales, helped by colder weather, sending shares across the sector higher on hopes other retailers have defied forecasts for gloomy festive trading.  Next shares were up 7.4 percent at 1230 GMT on Wednesday after it also raised its full-year profit forecast, while shares in rivals Marks & Spencer and Primark owner Associated British Foods gained 1.5 and 2.2 percent respectively.  With Britain\u2019s consumers being squeezed by slow wage growth and the jump in inflation that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, expectations for Christmas spending had been subdued.  However, Next, the first major listed retailer to update on festive trading, reported full price sales growth of 1.5 percent in the 54 days to Dec. 24, a period covering the bulk of its financial fourth quarter.  That beat company guidance for a fall of 0.3 percent and follows third quarter growth of 1.3 percent. Growth in online sales more than compensated for lower sales in stores.  \u201cWe have long believed that conditions were not as bad as many believed for the consumer and we expect the next few weeks\u2019 statements to show that companies with the right offer can do very well,\u201d said analysts at Peel Hunt.  Separately on Wednesday department store John Lewis reported strong trading in the week to Dec. 23, with total sales up 8.9 percent. It enjoyed its biggest ever week for fashion sales.  Next CEO Simon Wolfson told Reuters he was \u201ca lot more confident\u201d about the retailer\u2019s prospects than he was a year ago when the company issued a profit warning.  Next trades from more than 500 stores in the UK and Ireland and operates the Directory internet and home shopping business.  It had been Britain\u2019s most successful clothing retailer this century in terms of profits but has faltered over the last two years due to a shift in spending away from clothing towards holidays and entertainment. Its shares had fallen 7 percent over the last year prior to Wednesday\u2019s update.  CEO Wolfson cautioned that many of the issues Next faced over the last 12 months would linger in 2018.  Subdued UK consumer demand driven by a decline in real income and the shift to spending on leisure at the expense of clothing remained major challenges, said Wolfson.  But he said cost price inflation would reduce to 2 percent in the first half of its 2018-19 year and disappear in the second half.  The Next figures illustrated the contrasting fortunes of trading in its stores and online. Sales at stores fell 6.1 percent but online sales were up 13.6 percent.  Those numbers will fuel the debate over Next\u2019s strategy of continuing to add retail space.  Next\u2019s first half results, published in September, showed 53 percent of total sales from stores and the balance from online.  Next is still expanding its store base, with plans for up to 200,000 square feet of additional space in 2018-19. It believes that even if shops become less productive, they will not make losses.  Wolfson said that even if retail like-for-like sales were falling by 10 percent, the stores would remain an asset.  \u201cWhat we\u2019ve had to get our heads around is the idea that you can invest in a shop today that will make less profit in year 10 than it does in year one but because you get your money back in two years it\u2019s still a very good investment,\u201d he said.  Next upgraded its central pretax profit guidance for 2017-18 to 725 million pounds ($985.5 million), up from previous guidance of 717 million pounds but well below the 790.2 million pounds made in 2016-17.  Next forecast full price sales growth of about 1 percent in the 2018-19 year and another fall in profit to 705 million pounds, with costs growing faster than sales. That outcome would be a third straight year of profit decline.  But Next also flagged a 300 million pounds share buyback in 2018-19 that would boost earnings per share.

          "body": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said on Wednesday President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s response to days of protests across Iran was appropriate and that Ankara valued Iranian stability, in one of the first regional expressions of support for Tehran.  A source in Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s office said he discussed the week-long unrest in Iran during a telephone call with Rouhani. The Iranian president told Erdogan he hoped the protests would be over \u201cin a few days\u201d, the source said.  Erdogan\u2019s sympathetic comments follow an improvement in relations between Ankara and Tehran, which have worked together in recent months to reduce violence in Syria, despite backing opposing sides in the conflict for several years.  Rouhani said on Sunday Iranians had the right to protest and criticize the authorities but their actions should not lead to violence or damage public property.  Erdogan told Rouhani \u201cthat he found his comments about not violating the law while exercising their right to peaceful protests was appropriate\u201d, the source said.  On Wednesday pro-government rallies in several Iranian cities drew thousands of marchers waving Iranian flags and pictures of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  Turkey\u2019s ties with Iran expanded last year as Ankara\u2019s relations with the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia - Tehran\u2019s main international opponents - all frayed.  Secular but overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim Turkey shares a border with mainly Shi\u2019ite Muslim Iran. They are the two biggest non-Arab powers in the Middle East region.   In August Iran\u2019s military chief of staff visited Turkey, which is a member of the NATO military alliance, for talks on cooperation in the Syrian conflict and counter-terrorism.  \u201cIran\u2019s stability is important for us. We are against foreign interventions in Iran,\u201d Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, in remarks quoted by television channel NTV.   \u201cIf the leadership is to change in Iran, the Iranian people will do this,\u201d he said.  Broadcaster CNN Turk said Cavusoglu also echoed Rouhani\u2019s suggestion that the United States and Israel had provoked unrest.   \u201cThere are two people supporting the demonstrations in Iran: (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and (U.S. President Donald) Trump,\u201d it quoted Cavusoglu as saying.  Netanyahu has praised Iranian anti-government protesters, while denying as \u201claughable\u201d accusations that Israel was behind the demonstrations. Trump has tweeted that Iranians are \u201cfinally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime\u201d.  Reporting by Ece Toksabay and Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Dominic Evans and Gareth Jones"

          "body": "(Refiles to change date in bullet point and tweak headline)  * Pressure on dollar funding costs decline  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Saikat Chatterjee  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The dollar bounced on Wednesday, snapping a three-week losing streak as investors consolidated positions before manufacturing data and minutes of a December U.S. Federal Reserve meeting due later in the day. But despite the dollar\u2019s rebound, market strategists remain downbeat about the prospects of the greenback in the near term on concerns that future U.S. rate hikes were broadly priced into the markets.  \u201cFrom a DXY basis, there is very little going on for the dollar from current levels as we are seeing the continuation of very easy financial conditions with accompanying fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy for EMEA at State Street Global Markets referring to the dollar\u2019s trade-weighted basket against its rivals by its popular acronym.  Evidence of easy financial conditions were evident with real interest rates in the U.S. holding near their lowest in nearly five years, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The greenback bounced 0.3 percent on the day to 92.10 after falling 2.5 percent over the last three weeks. On an annual basis, 017 was the biggest annual drop for the greenback in 14 years.  Despite the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years passed by U.S. policymakers in late-December, market analysts believe the worrying lack of inflation pressures would keep the dollar on the back foot in the coming months.  \u201cThe key question for markets is what is the game changer for the dollar in the short term and unless we see a significant pick up in inflation, the dollar will remain on the back foot,\u201d said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.  Seasonal forces were also at play such as a broad decline in dollar funding requirements over the thin-year period which typically acts as a support for the greenback.  BNP Paribas strategists said dollar funding pressures as noted by cross-currency basis swaps peaked earlier than usual in December and has eased dramatically in recent days, eroding a key support.  Euro/dollar cross-currency basis swaps for three-month maturities settled at its tightest levels in nearly three years at 22.5 basis points, indicating that broad demand for dollars was muted..  Meanwhile, the euro was flirting near a four-month high hit on Tuesday prompted by optimism over the euro zone\u2019s economy and expectations the European Central Bank will wind down its bond-buying stimulus in 2018.  The ECB board member in charge of the central bank\u2019s market operations, Benoit Coeure, said at the weekend he saw a \u201creasonable chance\u201d bond purchases would not be extended beyond September.  The single currency was trading at $1.2017 after hitting a four-month high of $1.2081 on Tuesday, marking a gain of roughly 3 percent from a mid-December trough and bringing it close to a September high of $1.2092, the currency\u2019s highest level since early 2015.  Helping the euro has also been higher eurozone bond yields in recent weeks the spread between ten-year U.S. and German bond yields holding near its tightest levels in nearly six weeks.  Among data due later in the session is manufacturing ISM data in the United States and minutes of the December U.S. central bank meeting.

          "body": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - A Kenyan online sports betting firm has canceled 600 million shillings ($5.80 million) in direct annual sponsorship for the country\u2019s main football league and other sports, after the government hiked taxes for such firms by more than four times.  The government increased the tax rate on gross profits for sports betting firms, lotteries and casinos to 35 percent last year, from 7.5 percent, to create a fund for sports, culture and the arts. It says the rapid growth of betting in a loosely regulated environment has hurt the young and vulnerable.  Ronald Karauri, the chief executive of Sportpesa, one of the biggest firms, said they were left with no choice but to cut costs in order to survive.   \u201cAll we will have to do is manage our expenditure in terms of our marketing expenses,\u201d he told Reuters on Wednesday.    \u201cWe had really committed ourselves to sports in the country so it is a very huge burden for us as a cost.\u201d   Sportpesa has been sponsoring the Kenyan football federation, the country\u2019s premier league, various clubs including last year\u2019s league champions Gor Mahia, the national rugby union and boxing.  Ambrose Rachier, the chairman of Gor Mahia, said the club might be forced to pull out of this year\u2019s Confederation Champions League Cup, a regional competition, due to lack of funds. The team was getting 60 million shillings a year from Sportpesa.  \u201cIt is devastating ... We are in mourning,\u201d Rachier said.  The situation was the same at the Kenya Rugby Union, which is losing 120 million shillings a year, used to prepare squads for the international rugby sevens series.   It was also using the cash to pay training and match allowances to its 15-a-side teams, said Richard Omwela, the chairman of the rugby union.  \u201cIt is a total shutdown,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless the government steps in and says we will underwrite that, what we possibly will do is tell our suppliers and partners that we can\u2019t meet our obligations.\u201d    Kenyan sports teams have long been beset by poor management and corruption, which have hindered their performance abroad and discouraged fans at home.  In 2016, sports officials were investigated after the team to that year\u2019s Olympic games in Brazil complained of mismanagement of flight and hotel bookings, theft of kits and even the mishandling of the list of accredited participants.    Despite problems in the build up to Rio, the East African nation enjoyed its most successful Olympics, winning six gold medals, six silvers and one bronze, all in track and field.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Australian teenager Alex De Minaur delighted his home fans with an inspired performance to stun fourth seed Milos Raonic and move into the Brisbane Open quarter-finals on Wednesday.  The 18-year-old wildcard broke the big-serving former champion three times en route to a 6-4 6-4 upset in 94 minutes and set up a clash with American teenager Michael Mmoh.  World number 208 De Minaur put his Canadian opponent under pressure early on in the contest, grabbing a break in the third game before hanging on to take the first set.  A rusty Raonic tried to mount a comeback late in the second set but De Minaur resisted the charge of the world number 24 and pushed on for the biggest win of his career.  Mmoh, 19, earlier saved six break points and converted four of his own to upset eighth seed Mischa Zverev 6-2 5-7 6-4 for only his second victory on the ATP Tour.  Nick Kyrgios overcame pain in his knee to beat Australian compatriot Matthew Ebden 6-7(3) 7-6(5) 6-2 in his first singles match since a hip injury ended his season in October.  Kyrgios, who took a medical timeout while trailing 4-5 in the opening set, received treatment again two games later and struggled to find his feet as Ebden edged the tiebreaker.  The world number 21 hit back in the second set and pulled away in the decider to set up a clash with Alexandr Dolgopolov who beat Argentina\u2019s Horacio Zeballos 6-1 6-2.  \u201cIt took me a while to get used to playing a match again,\u201d Kyrgios said after the 131-minute encounter.  \u201cI\u2019ve been training here for so long and training on center court, it kind of didn\u2019t feel like a match. The longer the match went, the better I played, the looser I got. I knew it was going to be a tough day today.

          "body": "* German leader\u2019s conservatives weakened in Sept election  * Merkel meets leaders of SPD, Bavarian CSU on Wednesday  * She seeks another \u2018grand coalition\u2019, but SPD wary  * No deal could mean new elections  By Madeline Chambers and Thorsten Severin  BERLIN, Jan 3 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel will put her reputation as Europe\u2019s consummate consensus-builder on the line on Wednesday, when she launches a second bid to form a coalition government after weeks of sniping between its would-be partners.  Seeking a fourth term in office, Merkel saw her authority weakened in a national election in September, when support for her conservatives was eroded by the far right.  She is now under increasing pressure to reach a deal with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), which also lost ground in the election, but the two sides have bickered over a range of issues, notably immigration and taxation.  At a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, Merkel will try to build trust with SPD leader Martin Schulz and the head of Bavaria\u2019s CSU conservatives, Horst Seehofer, by agreeing a structure for talks that are due to start on Sunday and could lead to official coalition negotiations in a few weeks.  Having failed before Christmas to form a coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), Merkel is now leading an interim government with the SPD that is keeping things ticking over in Europe\u2019s biggest economy.  Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU alliance ruled in a \u2018grand coalition\u2019 with the SPD from 2013 to 2017 and, with investors fearing a protracted power vacuum that could delay reforms in Germany and the European Union, she is pressing for a re-run of that arrangement.  But the SPD has shown reluctance, with some of its members favouring a looser cooperation agreement or supporting a minority government.  The two blocs are at odds on issues from healthcare and immigration to Europe and pensions and, if no deal is done, Merkel\u2019s future as chancellor would be thrown into doubt with new elections a distinct prospect.  In recent days some conservatives, especially from Bavaria, have stoked tensions by calling for tax cuts for high earners and reductions in benefits for asylum seekers, which the SPD opposes.  \u201cAgain verbal shenanigans from the Bavarian CSU,\u201d tweeted one of the SPD\u2019s deputy leaders, Ralf Stegner.  \u201cAlways the same recipe: humour the lederhosen public. No sense of reality in terms of agreeing with the other parties.\u201d  But Seehofer sounded more conciliatory on Wednesday, saying \u201cimportant days\u201d lay ahead. \u201cWe will do everything in these talks to reach sensible agreements,\u201d said the Bavarian before internal party talks on Wednesday morning.  One of Merkel\u2019s priorities will be to establish an atmosphere of trust between the parties, the absence of which led to the collapse of the talks with the Greens and FDP in November.  Many within the SPD, which said it would go into opposition after the election in which its support slumped to its lowest level since 1933, fear sharing power with Merkel again will lead voters to punish it further.  To keep the rank and file on board, the SPD leadership has said it will let its members vote on Jan 21 on going ahead with detailed coalition talks after a first exploratory phase has been completed.  \u201cI have said that (a coalition deal) must be agreed at the very latest by Easter,\u201d said Seehofer.

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - A merry runup to Christmas may delay Next\u2019s much-needed style overhaul. The British clothing retailer is more upbeat about the outlook for full-year profit. But healthier sales and diminishing price pressures may allow Chief Executive Simon Wolfson to dodge tough decisions, such as much-needed store closures.  Next on Wednesday increased the midpoint of its full-year profit guidance by 1 percent, to 725 million pounds. Though modest, the rise shows the retailer is selling more goods at full price and discounting less stock at margin-dilutive end-of-season sales. There is also good news on the prices that the company pays for clothing sourced from abroad. Next expects a spike in cost prices caused by the 2016 drop in sterling\u2019s value to fade during the course of this year.  Cosmetic improvements may, however, tempt Next to neglect a basic problem. Its high-street stores are in difficulty, with full-price sales in Next\u2019s bricks-and-mortar shops down 7.2 percent in the year to Christmas Eve. Yet Next will have added around 85,000 square feet of new selling space in the year to January 2018 at a time when other retailers are closing stores.   The issue is easily tackled. Roughly 70 percent of the company\u2019s leases run out within a decade, while many of its rivals are locked into more onerous 25-year contracts. And Wolfson\u2019s group has an edge when it comes to the internet. Thanks to a legacy catalogue business that dates back to the 1980s, its booming online arm now accounts for approximately 45 percent of group sales. Marks & Spencer sells only 18 percent of its clothing and home products over the web.   This advantage is not yet reflected in Next\u2019s valuation. Its shares currently change hands for a little more than 11 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, pretty much the same as the valuation for M&S. By contrast, pure online players such as ASOS command an eye-popping 65 times. Next can close part of the gap by focusing on its fundamental problems rather than the festive cheer.

          "title": "Philippines bars U.S. firm call center from expanding after deadly fire",
          "body": "MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines has barred a branch of an American call center firm from expanding in the country following a pre-Christmas fire that killed dozens of its employees, a senior government official said on Wednesday.  Charito Plaza, director-general of the government\u2019s Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), said the agency had suspended the operations of American firm Research Now SSI, as well as the shopping mall hosting it, for failing to meet certain safety requirements since 2013.  \u201cThey can operate again once they get a clearance from the Bureau of Fire and the local government,\u201d Plaza told Reuters in a text message.  The authority\u2019s suspension took effect on Dec. 29, but it only covers SSI\u2019s branch in the southern city of Davao where the Dec. 23 blaze broke out at a furniture and fabric store on a lower floor of the New City Commercial Center (NCCC) mall before engulfing the call center\u2019s offices.  Thirty-eight people were killed.  SSI\u2019s office in Cebu, in the central Philippines, would not be affected as it has been complying with PEZA rules, Plaza said.  Investigators looking into fire said there were indications safety lapses may have contributed to the tragedy.      \u201cViolations were more of the non-compliance of annual emergency drills to test the fire safety equipment, response and rescue capability, sprinklers and\u00a0emergency exits,\u201d Plaza said.  SSI and the mall were registered with PEZA in 2008, as a business process outsourcing firm and an economic zone developer, respectively.  PEZA did not issue fire inspection and safety certificates to NCCC and SSI from 2013 to 2017, Plaza said.      But the companies were able to renew their business permits with the city government of Davao after passing fire safety inspection by the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), Plaza said.  How SSI and NCCC secured fire safety inspection certificates from the bureau is one of the things an inter-agency task force looking into the blaze is investigating.   Four fire officials being questioned over the blaze have been relieved of their duties after initial findings showed they have \u201csome liabilities\u201d, a government investigator said on Monday.  Davao planning chief Ivan Cortez said the city gives business permits to companies after they get a fire safety and inspection certificate from the Bureau of Fire Protection.  \u201cThe agency focusing on fire is the Bureau of Fire. The local government will not release a permit without the approval of the Bureau of Fire. They are the last office. When they approve, that is the time we release the business permit,\u201d Cortez told Reuters.   NCCC could not immediately be reached for comment. An SSI  official declined to comment and referred Reuters to its legal representative.  It was not clear yet how the suspension would affect SSI workers.      SSI employed 500 people at the Davao call center and since the fire said it would not comment until after investigations were concluded.   NCCC has insisted it had met safety requirements.

          "body": "* Norway tops global sales of electric cars  * Electric, hybrid cars make up 52 pct of 2017 sales  * Big subsidies have aided shift from fossil fuel cars  By Camilla Knudsen and Alister Doyle  OSLO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Sales of electric and hybrid cars exceeded half of new registrations in Norway in 2017, a record aided by generous subsidies that extended the Nordic nation\u2019s lead in a shift from fossil-fuel engines, data showed on Wednesday.  Pure electric cars and hybrids, which have both battery power and a diesel or petrol motor, accounted for 52 percent of all new car sales in 2017 in Norway against 40 percent in 2016, the independent Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.  \u201cNo one else is close\u201d in terms of a national share of electric cars, OFV chief Oeyvind Solberg Thorsen said. \u201cFor the first time we have a fossil fuel market share below 50 percent.\u201d  Norway exempts new electric cars from many taxes and road tolls and owners often get free parking and charging. Norway also generates almost all its electricity from hydropower, so the shift helps to reduce air pollution and climate change.  Last year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said Norway was far ahead of other nations such as the Netherlands, Sweden, China, France and Britain in electric car sales.  By the IEA yardstick, which excludes hybrid cars which only have a small electric motor that cannot be plugged in, electric car sales in Norway rose to 39 percent in 2017 from 29 in 2016, when the Netherlands was in second on 6.4 percent.  \u201cThe shift has gone faster than we\u2019d thought, and the big car makers say they\u2019re going all in to produce non-fossil cars,\u201d Thorsen told Reuters. Norway\u2019s electric car policies contrast with its big offshore oil and gas production.  Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association which represents owners, said it was too early to reduce incentives for electric cars, noting that parliament has set a goal of phasing out sales of fossil fuel vehicles by 2025.  \u201cIt\u2019s an ambitious goal only seven years away,\u201d she told Reuters.  A plan last year by the right-wing government to trim electric car incentives in the nation of 5.3 million people, dubbed a \u201cTesla Tax\u201d, was dropped in negotiations on the 2018 budget.  Norwegian car sales in 2017 were topped by the Volkswagen Golf, BMWi3, Toyota Rav4 and Tesla Model X. The Tesla is pure electric and others have electric or hybrid versions.  Overall, sales of pure electric cars in Norway rose in 2017 to 21 percent from 16 in 2016.  Sales of diesel cars fell most in 2017, to 23 percent from 31 in 2016. Some regions in Norway have started to charge higher road tolls for diesel cars than for petrol-driven vehicles. (Reporting By Alister Doyle and Camilla Knudsen Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)"

The 20 clubs in Spain\u2019s top flight took in 1.247 billion euros, rising from 1.237 billion from the previous year, with Barca earning an extra 6.2 million than the year before.  The income is distributed according to results in the last five years, explaining why Barca, champions in 2013, 2015 and 2016, earned more than Real, who won the title last season for the first time since 2012.  Real earned the second biggest amount, 140 million euros, Atletico Madrid picked up the third largest share, 99 million, while Athletic Bilbao took the fourth largest sum, 71 million.  Leganes, who in 2016 were promoted to the top flight for the first time ever, earned the smallest amount of all the teams, pocketing 39.3 million.  Barca are nine points clear of Atletico at the top of La Liga, which resumes on Saturday after taking a two-week winter break.  Last season was the second campaign in which La Liga sold its television rights collectively following a change in the Spanish law in 2015. Under the previous system, based on club\u2019s negotiating their deals individually, the league earned a total 851 million euros from television rights.  La Liga, which controls the top two divisions in Spanish football, distributes 90 percent of income to the top flight, with 10 percent going to the second tier Segunda Division.  The league is currently negotiating its next television deal, coming into effect from 2019-20, which the organisation\u2019s president Javier Tebas says could be worth 2.3 billion.

          "body": "(Repeats with no changes)  By Jessica Toonkel and Anjali Athavaley  Jan 2 (Reuters) - Cable company Altice USA Inc is employing a new negotiating tactic when it comes to reaching agreements with content providers on prices: pointing customers to programmers\u2019 own streaming services.  The New York-based cable company announced on Monday it would no longer carry Starz\u2019 channels to its 3.4 million Optimum and SuddenLink TV customers, after the two failed to reach an agreement on pricing. It advised customers to sign up for the premium cable network\u2019s $8.99 online video service if they want to continue getting its programming.  It is unusual for a cable company to direct customers to a network\u2019s online streaming service. But it could help cable and satellite companies during carriage disputes because it is easier to weather a blackout when subscribers can get the content directly online, Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson said in an email.  The move by a cable company to direct customers toward a streaming service demonstrates how negotiations between programmers and distributors are getting more contentious as the number of pay TV subscribers continues to drop.  Six U.S. cable providers, including Altice, said they lost more than 1.6 million subscribers through the third quarter of 2017.  \u201cThis is highly unusual,\u201d said John Janedis, an analyst with Jefferies. \u201cWe could be embarking on a new path for distributors.\u201d  Altice is replacing Starz with channels such as Hallmark Drama, Cowboy Channel, Sony Movies and MGM HD.  Starz, which is owned by Lionsgate and has popular shows including \u201cOutlander\u201d and \u201cPower,\u201d in a statement urged customers to demand refunds from Altice.  Altice sells HBO and CBS\u2019 All Access streaming services with its broadband Internet service without requiring the purchase of a bundle of cable channels, but it does not sell the Starz service broadband-only homes.  Jefferies noted that the financial impact of Altice\u2019s move on Lionsgate was modest. Lionsgate shares closed at $33.01 on Tuesday, down 2.36 percent.  If Starz loses all one million of Altice\u2019s subscribers, it would need to bring in 700,000 online streaming customers to its service, which currently has about 2 million subscribers, to break even, according to Jefferies.  Dish Network Corp in November used a similar tactic when it pointed customers to CBS\u2019s All Access online streaming service, as part of a carriage dispute that was resolved within days.  The tactics demonstrate the pressure that distributors are under, Janedis said.  \u201cThey are all spending significantly more on programming to drive subscribers so they need to find the best way to maximize their programming spend,\u201d he said.

          "body": "(Repeats story published Tuesday with no changes)  By Beth Pinsker  NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The first paychecks of 2018 will be dispatched soon, but it may be weeks or months before taxpayers and payroll processors know how the new U.S. tax laws will affect your take-home pay.  The Internal Revenue Service said it expected to issue guidance in January on how much in taxes employers should withhold based on the new tax rates. Employers and payroll services would then implement those changes starting in February.  You might not even notice when it happens because the effect on your paycheck could be relatively small, depending on your income and your tax situation.  \u201cWhen the taxes are reduced by 1 to 3 percent, that\u2019s not going to be a huge noticeable difference. It\u2019s not going to be hundreds of dollars,\u201d said Pete Isberg, vice president of government relations at ADP, the largest payroll processor in the United States, servicing the paychecks of one out of every six workers.  A difference of $1,000, for instance, would be less than $40 a pop for a worker paid biweekly.  Your paycheck is not actually a clear indicator of whether your overall taxes have gone up or down because of the new tax law. There may be other factors in your tax situation - such as owning a property or having multiple children - that could affect how much you owe Uncle Sam at the end of the year.  Be prepared for tax uncertainty until you do your taxes for 2018 a year or so from now. You cannot even estimate your taxes until tax professionals and do-it-yourself services like TurboTax update their software. And that cannot happen until the IRS releases the new withholding tables and issues more guidance on the specifics of other tax changes.  \u201cWe will be ready to help our customers. We just need more information,\u201d said David Williams, executive director of the Intuit Tax and Financial Center.  WAITING FOR W-4 FORMS  You may be tempted to get a jump on the IRS and change how much tax is taken out of your paycheck by adjusting your W-4 form, but that may be premature, warned Isberg.  The IRS said in its last note that it would be attempting to work with existing W-4 forms for now.  The standard federal W-4, which all employees fill out, is based on the notion of \u201callowances,\u201d which you could adjust based on your personal situation.  In the past, a single person with three children and a home in a high-tax state like New York might have listed themselves as married and claim one allowance per person, plus a few extra because they were likely to itemize their deductions and owe less. A married person with a freelance spouse who owes quarterly taxes might have listed themselves as single to have enough taken out to cover both of them.  The goal of people adjusting their withholding was to come as close as possible to paying the correct amount of tax - rather than owing money at the end of the year or ending up with a giant refund.  But it will all be different math for 2018.  \u201cFor first few weeks of January stay put, and see what the IRS comes out with,\u201d said Isberg, who also cautioned that employees should keep an eye on tax changes at the state level.  Above all, do not panic, said Farsheed Ferdowsi, president and CEO of Inova Payroll, which handles paychecks for more than 3,000 companies.  \u201cWhen you have changes in taxes, it usually goes a lot smoother than most people know,\u201d Ferdowsi said. \u201cIf the first (paycheck) is wrong, it catches up on the next one.\u201d (Editing by Lauren Young and Lisa Shumaker)"

          "body": "LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Europe\u2019s market big bang offers clear pain for a fuzzy gain. The overhaul of financial rules bundled in the European Union\u2019s MiFID II directive is designed to make finance fairer and safer. But that laudable aim comes at a heavy cost, with an unrealistic deadline, and may open up new regulatory loopholes.  The latest iteration of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which comes into force on Wednesday, touches most aspects of European financial markets. Banks will have to make sure customers are sold the right products and charge them directly for services like research that were previously bundled into trading costs. Fund managers will have to make sure they get the best prices, and more trading will happen on transparent platforms.   The result should be more competition and better prices \u2013 ultimately leading to cheaper capital for companies. Such desirable aims come with a hefty up-front bill, though. Opimas, a consultancy, reckons banks, brokers and asset managers will spend 2.5 billion euros getting ready for MiFID II, and over 700 million euros a year after that coping with new rules. Most of that burden will fall on banks.  There are indirect costs, too. Forcing banks and brokers to charge customers directly for research is likely to shrink the amount of financial analysis conducted by banks. That may impair price discovery, particularly for smaller companies, pushing up their cost of capital. Moreover, the burden of regulation will benefit firms with superior technology and bigger businesses. That may encourage consolidation and restrict choice.  The rules may also create new loopholes in financial markets. Take the clumsily-named \u201csystematic internalisers\u201d, a kind of trading system where banks match orders from clients directly with positions on their books, rather than executing trades through an exchange. These may now have a competitive edge over more heavily regulated exchanges. That could fragment markets and undermine MiFID II\u2019s stated aim of improving transparency.  Lastly, the new rules may encourage more trading to shift outside the EU. Take \u201cdark pools\u201d - trading venues with fewer disclosure requirements than exchanges. By limiting their use, MiFID II may simply push those trades to take place elsewhere.   A more immediate question is when the rules will actually come into force. German and British regulators have already given clearing houses a last-minute reprieve from rules giving customers more choice over where to clear trades. If that encourages other delays to the rules, or sloppy implementation, the big bang may still be some way off.

          "body": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - U.S.-based seabed exploration firm Ocean Infinity on Wednesday said it was moving a vessel closer to a possible search area for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 as it soon expects to be awarded a contract by Malaysia to resume the search.  The disappearance of the aircraft en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people aboard ranks among the world\u2019s greatest aviation mysteries. Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200-million ($156.62 million) search in January last year.  But in October, Malaysia said it was in talks with Ocean Infinity to resume the search on a \u201cno-cure, no-fee\u201d basis, meaning it will only get paid if it finds the plane.  \u201cOcean Infinity is hopeful of receiving the final contract award for the resumption of the search for MH370 over the coming days,\u201d a company spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement.  \u201cWith a relatively narrow weather window, we are moving the vessel, Seabed Constructor, towards the vicinity of the possible search zone. This is designed to save time should the contract award be forthcoming, as hoped,\u201d he said.  Reuters shipping data showed the Seabed Constructor left Durban, South Africa, on Tuesday and was headed to Perth, Australia, where it is due on Feb. 7.  Malaysia\u2019s deputy transport minister, Aziz Kaprawi, said the government was negotiating final terms of the agreement with Ocean Infinity and he was not aware of the vessel\u2019s movement.  \u201cWe are in the final stages of the decision. On our part, we have yet to finalize the agreement,\u201d he told Reuters.  When asked whether Australia and China would be consulted about the contract award, Aziz said: \u201cBasically, Malaysia will make the decision, as this offer was made to the Malaysian government. The cost will also be decided by Malaysia.\u201d  Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the transponder of the Boeing 777 before diverting it over the Indian Ocean.  Various pieces of debris have been collected from Indian Ocean islands and Africa\u2019s east coast and at least three of them have been confirmed as coming from the missing plane.

          "body": "COLOMBO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee closed steady on Wednesday in dull trade, as demand for dollars from importers and banks offset conversion of the U.S. currency by exporters, dealers said.  The spot rupee, which traded at 153.80 per dollar during the day, ended at 153.70/80 per dollar, unchanged from Tuesday\u2019s close.  The currency fell 2.5 percent last year and dropped 3.9 percent in 2016.  \u201cIt was a dull day. There were not many importers in the market and the exporters are also reluctant to come as they are awaiting the central bank\u2019s directive on derivatives,\u201d said a currency dealer.  The central bank, while announcing its key economic policies for this year, said the conduct of monetary policy is dependent on an effective and prudent exchange rate policy.  \u201cIt has allowed more flexibility in determining the exchange rate based on the market conditions and has intervened only to smoothen volatility and to build up reserves,\u201d the central bank said in its policy statement.  \u201cIt is noteworthy that there has been a build-up of non-debt creating international reserves during 2017, with minimal impact on the exchange rate.\u201d  It also said that foreign exchange intervention policies will be adopted consistent with a flexible exchange rate regime and supportive of improving foreign exchange market functionality, and maintaining a competitive exchange rate will be an important objective.  Dealers said the import pressure will be seen until the central bank sorts out the new derivatives regulations, which has slowed forward trading in the currency.

          "body": "MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Wednesday it had killed two militants in Somalia in an air strike targeting al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked Islamist group that is fighting to topple the U.N.-backed government.  The military\u2019s Africa Command said the strike took place around 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the capital Mogadishu on Tuesday, and that a \u201cvehicle-borne improvised explosive device\u201d had also been destroyed in the early morning attack.  Last month Washington warned of a threat to its diplomatic staff in Mogadishu and directed all non-essential staff to leave the city.  Al Shabaab was pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011 and has lost control of most of Somalia\u2019s major towns. But the group retains a strong presence in the south and center and can still carry out major attacks. It was blamed for twin bomb blasts in Mogadishu in October that killed more than 500 people.  The militants aim to topple Somalia\u2019s government, to drive out African Union peacekeeping troops and to impose the group\u2019s own strict interpretation of Islamic law.

          "body": "(Adds details, quotes)  By Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal  COLOMBO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth in 2018 is forecast at between 5-5.5 percent, bouncing back from an anticipated four-year low of less than 4 percent last year, central bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said on Wednesday.  The turnaround was expected in the wake of a stronger global economy, but the governor\u2019s deputy said the central bank would be cautious easing monetary policy, though official interest rates stand at four-year highs.  Tight fiscal and monetary policies along with periods of both drought and floods contributed to last year\u2019s slower growth.  \u201cEconomic growth is expected to pick up to between 5-5.5 percent. The economy is stabilising and on the right path but growth is still a challenge,\u201d Coomaraswamy told the heads of banks, financial institutions, stockbrokerages and state-owned firms at an event to unveil economic policies for 2018.  The central bank has kept policy interest rates unchanged since the last rise in March 2017, having embarked on a tightening cycle in December 2015.  During that time the central bank had raised rates three times and increased commercial banks\u2019 statutory reserve ratio (SRR) once to prevent sharp fall in the rupee and curb demand-driven inflation. Private sector credit growth has slowed to a near three-year low of 15.4 percent year-on-year in November from a four-year high of 28.5 percent hit in May 2016.  Coomaraswamy said the central bank expect to maintain 15 percent credit growth this year and the decision to ease monetary policy in future would be \u201cdata-driven\u201d.  Consumer inflation was up 7.1 percent in December from a year earlier, slowing from a record high of 7.8 percent hit in October. The central bank is targeting inflation between 4-6 percent this year.  Deputy Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said the central bank will be cautious before easing the monetary policy.  \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily need to loosen the monetary policy achieve a growth which is below the potential,\u201d he told reporters after the policy announcement.  \u201cOur forecast is right now 5-5.5 percent growth. If that is not going to realised, then obviously we have to take measures in future. If this trend of declining inflation and growth being below potential continue, I don\u2019t see any reason why we should tighten monetary policy.\u201d (Reporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)"

          "body": "(Reuters) - World number one Simona Halep assured herself of top billing for the Australian Open after powering past local hope Duan Yingying and into the quarter-finals of the Shenzhen Open in China on Wednesday.  Halep hit 21 winners and won five out of eight break points to prevail 3-6 6-1 6-2 and secure her number one ranking going into next week and top seeding for Melbourne ahead of Caroline Wozniacki and Garbine Muguruza.  However, the Romanian did not have it easy until her rival suffered a thigh problem late on in the match after blazing through the first set to take the lead.  Caught off guard by Duan\u2019s big hitting early on, Halep turned things around in the second set and broke the world number 91 twice for a 5-1 lead before leveling the contest.  Duan took a medical timeout and returned for the decider with heavy strapping on her left thigh.  Halep, who battled past Duan in their previous meeting in Eastbourne last year, took advantage as Duan struggled to find her rhythm and raced to a 5-0 lead. She then subdued a late fightback to seal the win in 97 minutes.  \u201cI knew that she is playing really hard and hitting every ball. I knew I had to be strong on my legs,\u201d Halep said.  \u201cAfter the first set I was thinking I have to find rhythm, to stay closer to the baseline and open the court better, which I did... It was a very tough match.\u201d  Halep\u2019s compatriot and fourth seed Irina-Camelia Begu overcame Russia\u2019s Ekaterina Alexandrova 4-6 6-1 6-2. She was joined in the quarter-finals by Czech Katerina Siniakova who beat China\u2019s Wang Yafan 7-5 6-3.  Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge"

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - British trade minister Liam Fox said on Wednesday that London would continue to welcome foreign investment, after a U.S. panel rejected a Chinese acquisition of a U.S. money transfer company on national security concerns.  Fox was on a visit to China, the latest installment in long-running economic talks between China and Britain, which has taken on new importance for Britain as it looks to re-invent itself as a global trading nation after leaving the European Union in 2019.  The U.S. rejection of China\u2019s Ant Financial\u2019s acquisition of MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) is the most high-profile Chinese deal to be torpedoed under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.   Asked whether Britain would serve as an alternative destination for such Chinese investment, Fox told Reuters in an interview that he hoped the investment relationship would \u201cwork in two directions\u201d, but that Britain would remain open.  \u201cOf course, we would look, as other countries would do, at our security issues in terms of investment. But the UK has traditionally been an open country, welcoming of foreign direct investment. And we\u2019ll continue to do that,\u201d Fox said.  He did not comment specifically on the U.S. panel decision.  China is one of the countries with which Britain hopes to sign a free trade pact once it leaves the EU, and London and Beijing have been keen to show that Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc will not affect ties.  Fox said that the issue of China\u2019s service sector openness was a \u201cbig issue\u201d for Britain, but that there were more options than a post-Brexit free trade agreement (FTA) to get Beijing to open, including specific service sector agreements and mutual recognition deals.  \u201cThere are a whole range of tools in the box. And people tend to talk as though an FTA is the only tool we have available in terms of trade liberalization. It\u2019s not,\u201d he said.  The focus on a \u201cGolden Era\u201d of relations, trumpeted by China and Britain in 2015 when then-prime minister David Cameron hosted a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, has cooled under Cameron\u2019s successor, Theresa May.  In 2016, May caused a diplomatic spat by unexpectedly deciding to delay approval of a partly-Chinese funded nuclear power project.

          "body": "ABUJA (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed 11 people on Wednesday in an attack on a mosque in northeast Nigeria, the epicenter of the conflict with Islamist insurgency Boko Haram, military officials and an aid worker said.  The bomber hit the mosque in the town of Gamboru in Borno state, near Nigeria\u2019s border with Cameroon, during dawn prayers, said Ali Mustapha, an aid worker.  \u201cI was on my way to dawn prayer, then I heard the sound of a loud bomb explosion inside the mosque,\u201d Mustapha told Reuters.  \u201cThe mosque was destroyed and burnt,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter some hours, when we came to evacuation of the people, we saw 11 corpses, with the suicide bomber making (the total number of dead) 12.\u201d  Pictures of the aftermath of the blast showed the bodies of the dead uncovered and lined up on the ground. A building had been reduced to rubble, with only a few sections of wall left standing.  Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack, but it bears the hallmarks of Boko Haram, a jihadist group which frequently uses suicide bombers, often women and girls, to attack crowded public spaces such as mosques and markets.  Despite repeated government and military assertions that the insurgency has been defeated, Boko Haram continues to carry out lethal attacks on the military and civilians.  Last week four civilians were killed in an attack by suspected Boko Haram militants on Maiduguri, the Nigerian city at the center of the conflict with the Islamists.  In November a suicide bomber killed at least 50 people in an attack on a mosque, in one of the deadliest bombings of recent years.

According to the paper, Didi valued 99 at $1 billion, and acquired stakes owned by current shareholders Riverwood Capital, Monashees Inc., Qualcomm Ventures, Tiger Global Management LLC and Softbank Group Corp.  Contacted by Reuters, 99 declined to comment and said it will issue a statement \u201cat an appropriate time\u201d.  Buyout firms Riverwood and Monashees did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Calls to Tiger Global were not picked up outside business hours.  The paper said a $100 million investment announced by Didi in 99 a year ago gave the Chinese company a minority stake in the app.  The acquisition intensifies Didi\u2019s global rivalry with Uber, especially in Latin America. Reuters reported on Dec. 7 that Didi plans to enter Mexico this year.  The company has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond China, particularly in light of the growing number of Chinese customers who travel overseas. In April, Didi raised $5.5 billion from investors, in part to fund global expansion. (Reporting by Tatiana Bautzer, Gabriela Mello and Gram Slattery; Editing by Adrian Croft)"

          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - To sustain its march on the United States, Ant Financial may have to take some China-like steps. Jack Ma\u2019s digital-payments business must rethink its global strategy after U.S. authorities torpedoed a plan to buy MoneyGram International. Even a newly touted alliance between the two companies is at risk.   Ant and MoneyGram, which enables customers to transfer cash, said on Tuesday that despite a lengthy effort they were unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Though the deal was relatively small, at $1.2 billion, it\u2019s a setback for Ma, the founder of Alibaba, who has cosied up to President Donald Trump and sought to broaden his growing financial offshoot from China and Southeast Asia into an international network.  Ant, last valued at about $60 billion, probably will not be able to buy its way into the American money-movement and payments systems any time soon. Instead, it will have to keep forging partnerships like one it has with online and mobile-payments enabler Stripe. A \u201cstrategic cooperation\u201d unveiled with MoneyGram at the same time as the merger termination sounds half-hearted and half-baked, though. A fresh bid from rival suitor Euronet for MoneyGram could swiftly end any such arrangement.  As Ma steadily finds new partners and perhaps even contemplates a bolder Plan B that involves building his own separate U.S. payments outfit, he could also lay the groundwork for an even bigger deal. Just as American companies for years have been forced to tiptoe into China by acquiring minority stakes, Ant could do the same with $9 billion Western Union, a MoneyGram competitor, or even $90 billion PayPal.  Owning a slice of either, without taking board seats, would potentially flout the MoneyGram decision, but also ultimately sidestep CFIUS review. It would give Ant valuable insight into the workings of the U.S. market, while making clear to the industry and investors Ant\u2019s long-term ambitions. Tencent, whose own payments system is Ant\u2019s biggest domestic rival, has been enlisting a similar investment strategy, buying pieces of Snap and Tesla. It may not be Ma\u2019s first choice, but the company\u2019s insect namesake suggests it\u2019s ready for the complex work ahead for financial colonization.

The U.S. International Trade Commision recommended in November tariffs to keep Samsung and its home rival LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS) from flooding the U.S. market with inexpensive washers, a step that would benefit American appliance giant Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N).   Samsung said at the time that any tariffs would raise prices and impair job creation at its $380 million plant in South Carolina, which was announced in June to produce washing machines and other appliances.   U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make a decision on the recommendation early this year.   When asked about whether the plant will begin operations this month, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Yoon Boo-keun confirmed the plan to reporters on Wednesday. He did not elaborate.

But given the complexity and size of the reform, ESMA could not rule out glitches in coming days or weeks, Maijoor said.  The new rules, known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), were delayed by a year to Wednesday to give banks, asset managers and exchanges time to get ready.  \u201cWe think sufficient time has been given for all to be prepared for MiFID II,\u201d Maijoor said.  Regulators in Britain and Germany intervened just hours before the rollout began to give three clearing houses an exemption until July 2020 from opening themselves up to more competition.  Maijoor said this would be a \u201cone-off\u201d waiver and the new requirements for clearing houses would come into effect in 2020. (Reporting by Huw Jones; editing by Jason Neely)"

          "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has banned a film festival from screening a documentary later this week that features a teenage Palestinian female activist whose arrest last month has made her a symbol of resistance to Israeli military occupation in the West Bank.  Justifying the ban, authorities in the Southeast Asian city state said the film \u201cRadiance of Resistance\u201d was \u201cskewed\u201d and potentially divisive for Singapore\u2019s multi-ethnic population.  The documentary, which looks at the Palestine-Israeli conflict through the eyes of 16-year-old Ahed Tamimi and another young female activist, lacked \u201ccounterbalance\u201d, the Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) said on its website.  \u201cThe skewed narrative of the film is inflammatory and has the potential to cause disharmony amongst the different races and religions in Singapore,\u201d the IMDA said.   The documentary was due to have been shown at the Singapore Palestinian Film Festival on Thursday.  It was screened at a number of festivals worldwide in 2017 and won Best Documentary at the Respect Human Rights Film Festival in Belfast, but has become even more topical following Tamimi\u2019s arrest last month.  Tamimi was charged on Monday with counts of aggravated assault and will be tried in an Israeli military court. An adult found guilty of assaulting a soldier could be jailed for up to 10 years, but Tamimi is a minor so such an outcome is unlikely.  While Singapore\u2019s authorities are known to keep a tight rein on public speech and the media, especially when it comes to matters related to race and religion, outright bans are more rare.  Adela Foo, the organizer of the Singapore festival, called the ban \u201cunderstandable\u201d, without elaborating.  \u201cAt the end of the day, the IMDA\u2019s position is one to be respected,\u201d the 23-year-old student told Reuters.  With a sizable Muslim minority and surrounded by Muslim majority neighbors where sympathy for the Palestinian cause runs high, Singapore maintains friendly diplomatic and military ties with Israel. But it has lined up with many other countries opposed to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.  Around 15 percent of Singapore\u2019s 3.3 million resident population aged 15 years and over identify as Muslim, recent government surveys show.

          "title": "Philippines bars U.S. firm call center from expanding after deadly fire",
          "body": "MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines has barred a branch of an American call center firm from expanding in the country following a pre-Christmas fire that killed dozens of its employees, a senior government official said on Wednesday.  Charito Plaza, director-general of the government\u2019s Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), said the agency had suspended the operations of American firm Research Now SSI, as well as the shopping mall hosting it, for failing to meet certain safety requirements since 2013.  \u201cThey can operate again once they get a clearance from the Bureau of Fire and the local government,\u201d Plaza told Reuters in a text message.  The authority\u2019s suspension took effect on Dec. 29, but it only covers SSI\u2019s branch in the southern city of Davao where the Dec. 23 blaze broke out at a furniture and fabric store on a lower floor of the New City Commercial Center (NCCC) mall before engulfing the call center\u2019s offices.  Thirty-eight people were killed.  SSI\u2019s office in Cebu, in the central Philippines, would not be affected as it has been complying with PEZA rules, Plaza said.  Investigators looking into fire said there were indications safety lapses may have contributed to the tragedy.      \u201cViolations were more of the non-compliance of annual emergency drills to test the fire safety equipment, response and rescue capability, sprinklers and\u00a0emergency exits,\u201d Plaza said.  SSI and the mall were registered with PEZA in 2008, as a business process outsourcing firm and an economic zone developer, respectively.  PEZA did not issue fire inspection and safety certificates to NCCC and SSI from 2013 to 2017, Plaza said.      But the companies were able to renew their business permits with the city government of Davao after passing fire safety inspection by the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), Plaza said.  How SSI and NCCC secured fire safety inspection certificates from the bureau is one of the things an inter-agency task force looking into the blaze is investigating.   Four fire officials being questioned over the blaze have been relieved of their duties after initial findings showed they have \u201csome liabilities\u201d, a government investigator said on Monday.  Davao planning chief Ivan Cortez said the city gives business permits to companies after they get a fire safety and inspection certificate from the Bureau of Fire Protection.  \u201cThe agency focusing on fire is the Bureau of Fire. The local government will not release a permit without the approval of the Bureau of Fire. They are the last office. When they approve, that is the time we release the business permit,\u201d Cortez told Reuters.   NCCC could not immediately be reached for comment. An SSI  official declined to comment and referred Reuters to its legal representative.  It was not clear yet how the suspension would affect SSI workers.      SSI employed 500 people at the Davao call center and since the fire said it would not comment until after investigations were concluded.   NCCC has insisted it had met safety requirements.

          "body": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s unemployment rate hit a record low as its jobless total fell more than forecast in December, underpinning a broad-based economic upswing that augurs well for further strong growth in 2018.  Consumers in Europe\u2019s biggest economy are reaping the benefits of a jobs bonanza accompanied by rising real wages and ultra-low borrowing costs, while its exporters ride a recovery tide that is pushing up demand from the United States and China as well as other European states.  \u201cThere are no signs that the dynamic growth of the German economy will stop abruptly,\u201d KfW chief economist Joerg Zeuner said in a research note following Wednesday\u2019s Federal Labor Office data.   \u201cSo we expect new employment records for 2018 and a further tangible increase in real wages.\u201d  The seasonally adjusted jobless total dropped by 29,000 to 2.442 million, the data showed - more than double the 12,000 forecast in a Reuters poll.  December\u2019s unemployment rate was 5.5 percent, the same as a revised reading for November and the lowest level since German reunification in 1990, the office said. In 2017 as a whole, the rate fell to 5.7 percent from 6.1 percent.   The strong labor market provides welcome relief for conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel as she struggles to form a coalition government more than three months after a national election.  Data released on Tuesday showed Germany\u2019s workforce expanded last year to a record 44.3 million, and the Ifo economic institute expects the rosy picture to endure, with employment levels hitting 44.8 million this year and 45.2 million next.  The Labor Office said there were 761,000 job vacancies in December, suggesting companies are struggling to find skilled workers quickly.  But that offers scant comfort for those whom the economic upswing is leaving behind.  The number of Germany\u2019s long-term unemployed has remained broadly unchanged over the past ten years at around 1 million.  The German economy is expected to have grown by a calendar-adjusted 2.6 percent in 2017 and it is seen expanding by 2.5 percent in 2018, according to the Bundesbank.  The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product growth figures next week.           For a table of the labor market figures, click on:   editing by John Stonestreet"

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Prince Harry\u2019s wedding to American actress Meghan Markle could provide a 500 million pound boost to Britain\u2019s economy as tourists flock to the country and Britons celebrate, according to an estimate.  Harry, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson and fifth-in-line to the throne, will tie the knot with Markle on May 19 at Windsor Castle, the royal palace home of British kings and queens for almost 1,000 years.  According to the Office for National Statistics, the wedding of Harry\u2019s elder brother William to wife Kate in April 2011 led to an increase of 350,000 visitors to the UK compared to the same month the year before and business valuation consultancy Brand Finance predicted a similar surge in May.  In total, it estimates the nuptials will generate some 500 million pounds ($680 million).  \u201cWe think approximately 200 million pounds will come from tourism, travel, hotels,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive David Haigh told Reuters.  About 150 million pounds would be spent on people having parties and celebrating with 50 million coming from people buying T-shirts, hats and other commemorative items, he said. The wedding would also be worth about 100 million pounds in free advertising for Britain around the world, he added.  Businesses in Windsor are already gearing up to take advantage of the worldwide interest in the couple, with Harry, 33, one of the most popular members of the British royal family and Markle, 36, best known for her starring role in the TV legal drama \u201cSuits\u201d, providing some Hollywood sparkle.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a massive boost for the economy, it\u2019s going to be great to see so many people here for the wedding and actually to host the wedding itself,\u201d said Andrew Lee, manager of the Harte and Garter hotel opposite Windsor Castle.  British tourism bosses are already predicting 2018 to be a bumper year for the industry, aided by a fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 vote to leave the European Union which has attracted visitors and deterred Britons from vacationing abroad.  VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, estimates that 41.7 million visits from overseas will be made to the United Kingdom in 2018, generating 26.9 billion pounds in the process.

          "body": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in tweets on Tuesday that the United States may withhold future aid payments to Palestinians, accusing them of being \u201cno longer willing to talk peace\u201d with Israel.  Trump said that Washington gives Palestinians \u201cHUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don\u2019t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?\u201d  The President\u2019s tweets follow plans disclosed by his U.N. ambassador earlier on Tuesday to stop funding a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees.  \u201cThe President has basically said he doesn\u2019t want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table,\u201d Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters when asked about future U.S. funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.  The U.S. is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA\u2019s website.  Relations between the Palestinians and Washington soured early last month after Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, generating outrage across the Arab world and concern among Washington\u2019s Western allies.  Weeks later, more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favor of a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its stance on Jerusalem\u2019s status.  \u201cWhat we saw with the resolution was not helpful to the situation,\u201d Haley said on Tuesday.  \u201cThe Palestinians now have to show to the world that they want to come to the table. As of now, they\u2019re not coming to the table but they asked for aid. We\u2019re not giving the aid, we\u2019re going to make sure that they come to the table and we want to move forward with the peace process,\u201d she said.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called the Trump administration\u2019s decision on Jerusalem the \u201cgreatest crime\u201d and a flagrant violation of international law, and said it was unacceptable for the United States to have a role in the Middle East peace process because it was biased in favor of Israel.  On Tuesday, the Israeli Parliament passed an amendment that would make it harder for it to cede control over parts of Jerusalem in any peace deal with the Palestinians.

          "body": "BEIJING, Jan 3 (Reuters) - A U.S. government panel\u2019s decision to block Ant Financial\u2019s $1.2 billion acquisition of MoneyGram International Inc. is another indication that goodwill built during President Donald Trump\u2019s November Beijing trip is fading, according to China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news agency.  The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States rejected the deal on national security concerns, the most high-profile Chinese acquisition blocked under the Trump administration. The U.S. government has also been pressing China on multiple fronts including fairer bilateral trade and greater market access for U.S. companies.  \u201cIn the last 30 days of 2017, the U.S. government launched a Section 301 investigation into Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer, self-initiated probes into Chinese-made aluminum products, and rejected China\u2019s market economy status at the World Trade Organization,\u201d Xinhua said in a commentary on Wednesday.  \u201cThe bonhomie that grew between China and the United States in Beijing in November, when the two signed hundreds of billions of dollars of deals, seems to be fading away as the U.S. side is stuck in a zero-sum mentality,\u201d it said.  It added that retaliatory measures from China \u201ccould be on the table\u201d should the United States continue on its current course.  Ant Financial is controlled by Jack Ma, executive chairman of Chinese internet conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd , and other Alibaba executives. The firm sought to buy money transfer firm MoneyGram to boost its global footprint amid fierce competition from rival Tencent Holdings Ltd\u2019s WeChat payment platform.  Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters the U.S. panel blocked the deal on concerns about the safety of the data that can be used to identify U.S. citizens, rejecting proposals from Ant Financial and MoneyGram that sought to mitigate such risks.  \u201cWith deep-rooted strategic mistrust toward China, U.S. politicians have failed to catch up with China\u2019s understanding of cooperation and adopted an increasingly protective and isolationist approach,\u201d the Xinhua commentary said.  China\u2019s foreign ministry said separately on Wednesday that it hopes the U.S. can create a level playing field and a predictable environment for Chinese firms.

Ltd by two notches, citing the company\u2019s inability to access offshore funding channels to boost its liquidity in a timely manner.  The rating agency is downgrading Wanda Commercial for a second time since 2016. Fitch also maintained its \u2018Rating Watch Negative\u2019 to reflect the continued lack of definitive funding channels to boost Wanda\u2019s offshore liquidity.  Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, parent of Wanda Commercial and owned by one of China\u2019s richest men, Wang Jianlin, has invested heavily in entertainment and sports assets over the last few years. This has drawn the attention of Chinese regulators looking to stem perceived risky spending overseas.  \u201cWanda\u2019s liquidity position may come under substantial pressure if its offshore syndicated loan lenders demand for early repayment and Wanda fails to meet these demands promptly; or it fails to raise sufficient offshore liquidity to repay the $510 million second tranche of its offshore syndicated loan due in March 2018,\u201d Fitch said in a statement.  Wanda failed to issue offshore senior notes by the end of 2017 despite gaining the National Development and Reform Commission\u2019s (NDRC) approval for $1.5 billion in issuance quota, and it\u2019s still uncertain when State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) will approve Wanda to remit onshore fund offshore, it added.  \u201cThis could trigger the cross-default clauses for the $1.2 billion in senior notes, and add to repayment pressure.\u201d  Rating agencies S&P and Moody\u2019s last year downgraded Wanda Commercial to below investment grade.  Dalian Wanda Group last month said its 2017 revenues surpassed 200 billion yuan ($30.25 billion) and it had an equal amount in cash, responding to a local online media report that questioned the group\u2019s financial health.

          "body": "* Overall annual volume lowest since 2012  * Leveraged lending highest since financial crisis  By Alasdair Reilly and Claire Ruckin  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Syndicated lending in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2017 dropped 2% to US$894bn from the 2016 total, as a result of subdued refinancing activity in the first half and patchy acquisition financing throughout the year.  2017\u2019s annual volume is the lowest since 2012, when US$703bn was raised, as low commodity prices, European elections and continuing uncertainty around Brexit, Donald Trump and North Korea constrained borrower appetite despite the highly attractive terms still on offer.  The high levels of activity in the leveraged loan market in n 2017 failed to compensate for the loss of corporate volume across the wider market.  Meanwhile, volumes in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa were hit by a lack of refinancing opportunities, western sanctions against Russia, depressed oil prices, competitive bond markets and political volatility.  \u201cReduced loan volumes and number of deals coupled with improving bank balance sheets meant better terms for borrowers; but M&A was dominated by a limited number of jumbo acquisition financings. If you missed out on them, then the year was probably a disappointment,\u201d a senior banker said.  M&A loan volume dropped 9% to US$240bn in 2017 as activity remained sporadic. This was despite the ready availability of bridge loan financing and quick and cheap refinancing through the bond market as well as the rising Schuldschein market.  Jumbo loans dominated and the five biggest loans of the year were all acquisition related.  In January, British American Tobacco closed the largest loan of the year, placing US$25bn of bridge loans and \u00a35.68bn (US$7.72bn)of forward starting revolving credit facilities backing its acquisition of the remaining 57.8% stake in Reynolds American it did not already own.  In March, UK consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser syndicated US$21.2bn-equivalent of loans supporting its US$17.9bn acquisition of US baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co.  German infrastructure group Hochtief closed a \u20ac15bn (US$18.05bn)loan in November backing its \u20ac17.1bn bid for Spanish motorway operator Abertis, after Italian transport infrastructure company Atlantia backed its rival \u20ac17bn cash-and-shares bid in May with a \u20ac14.7bn loan.  Finnish utility Fortum closed a \u20ac12bn loan in September backing its \u20ac8.05bn bid for German conventional generation and energy trading group Uniper.  Refinancing, traditionally the main driver of the EMEA syndicated loan market, rebounded strongly in 2017 up 31% to US$564bn making up a substantial 63% of the market, as the second half of the year saw some companies refinance early while conditions remained positive.  In 2016 refinancing made up just 47% of the market as most companies remained comfortable having locked in low-priced loans until 2019 to 2021.  A number of big hitters came back to refinance their loans either through new credit facilities or amend and extends, including Nestle, which completed its annual renewal of \u20ac11bn-equivalent of loans in October.  Italian utility Enel signed a \u20ac10bn loan refinancing in December, replacing a \u20ac9.44bn facility that was due to mature in February 2020. Prior to that, German car maker BMW signed a \u20ac6bn refinancing in October on benchmark pricing.  Banks expect more refinancing in 2018 as 2019 maturities loom and ahead of potential interest rate rises and a possible tapering of the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programmes.  Leveraged lending rose nearly 40% to US$256bn in 2017 compared to US$182.72bn in 2016, reaching a 10-year high not seen since the financial crisis.  The first half of 2017 saw volume of US$142bn as borrowers took advantage of deep liquidity to reprice and refinance existing facilities on a more attractive basis.  First half activity was enough to bolster total annual volume and compensate for a decline in second half volume, which totalled US$114bn, as sponsors and investors focused on new money transactions.  The pickup in event-driven financings during the second half of 2017 pushed buyout activity to US$49bn above the US$41bn seen in 2016. Fewer but larger buyout transactions came to the market in 2017 with 100 deals completed in the year, down from 120 in 2016.  A number of public-to-privates provided some jumbo financings, much to the relief of new and existing CLOs and managed accounts desperate for new paper.  \u201cRefinancings and repricings dominated the first half of 2017 but buyout activity picked up in the second half providing some much needed new blood to Europe\u2019s leveraged loan market. Take privates were the buzz word in the second half,\u201d a senior loan banker said.  A \u20ac2.95bn-equivalent financing backing US private equity firm Hellman & Friedman\u2019s DKr33.1bn (US$5.3bn) take-private of payments firm Nets was the largest leveraged loan of the year.  The financing comprised a \u20ac1.86bn term loan B, which was the largest single tranche euro term loan B since the financial crisis, sources said. Despite its size, the borrower paid a tight margin of 325bp over Euribor, the tighter end of 325bp-350bp pricing guidance, characterising a year where demand far outweighed supply.  Other large P2Ps included a US$2.6bn cross-border loan financing that closed in November and backed the buyout of UK-based payment processing company Paysafe as well as a \u20ac1.4bn loan and a \u00a3266m loan for German generic drugmaker Stada that formed part of a larger loan and bond financing backing its \u20ac5.2bn buyout.  Stada was the largest leveraged loan of the third quarter, followed by a \u20ac1.09bn and \u00a3200m term loan for Dutch-headquartered bottle manufacturer Refresco, backing its acquisition of the bottling activities of listed Canada-based Cott Corp.  The pipeline has been building and the first quarter of 2018 looks set for a good start with the likes of an approximate \u20ac5.5bn leveraged financing backing US private equity firm KKR\u2019s \u20ac6.83bn acquisition of Unilever\u2019s margarine and spreads business. The leveraged loan element will total up to \u20ac3.9bn-equivalent, sources said.  HSBC topped the 2017 EMEA syndicated loan bookrunner league table, with a US$41.88bn market share and 167 deals. BNP Paribas claimed second place with US$38.45bn and 223 deals, while Deutsche Bank was third with a US$35.94bn market share and 118 deals.

          "body": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) - El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL.TA) said on Wednesday it will begin nonstop flights between Tel Aviv and San Francisco in the fourth quarter, as it continues to expand into North America.  Israel\u2019s flag carrier, which is facing increased competition from low cost carriers, said it will fly the route three times a week using new Boeing (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner aircraft.   It will compete with United (UAL.N), which launched flights between the two cities in 2016 to accommodate Israel\u2019s flourishing high-tech sector. Passengers on business often fly between Silicon Valley and Israel, which is one of the largest global tech centers.  \u201cThe acquisition of the Dreamliner enables us to expand our long-haul network,\u201d said David Maimon, El Al\u2019s chief executive.  \u201cSan Francisco is an important strategic city for El Al. Our target is to take the business segment.\u201d  In November, El Al started nonstop flights to Miami from Tel Aviv, after starting flights to Boston in 2015. It also flies nonstop to New York, Los Angeles and Toronto.  Maimon said El Al plans to add more long-haul routes but a decision would likely not be made until later in 2018.  He said El Al would have liked to have started San Francisco flights sooner but it did not have the proper aircraft.  El Al in 2017 started to receive its delivery of 16 new 787 aircraft that will be delivered through 2020 to replace its ageing long-haul fleet, which the airline hopes will win back customers lost to competitors.  Maimon is set to step down in a month after four years in the job. He told reporters that in the past four years, the number of El Al passengers rose to 5.7 million from 4.3 million, while its share price jumped.  He said a new CEO is expected to be named in the coming days.  El Al also said it was unifying all European flights under the El Al brand and retiring its low-cost brand UP that flew to five destinations in Europe.  It plans to refurbish all of its Boeing 737 aircraft to Europe with new seats in economy and in business class. The alterations should be complete in 2019.  It will also change its fare structure on European flights to include a less expensive \u201clite\u201d option for those who wish to travel without checked baggage.  The government on Tuesday said tourism to Israel rose 25 percent in 2017 to a record 3.6 million, buoyed by more 18 new routes flying into Tel Aviv and the Red Sea resort of Eilat.

          "body": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - Protests disrupted business in India\u2019s financial hub of Mumbai for a second day on Wednesday as lower-caste Dalits pelted buses, blocked rail lines and shut malls after a clash with right-wing Hindus.  Mumbai police advised people to avoid a number of key roads and intersections. Train services, the life line of the city, stalled throughout the day.  The Dalit call for a general strike across the western state of Maharashtra led to largely peaceful demonstrations. Police said protesters burned a few buses round the state, while dozens of buses and cars were damaged in Mumbai.      The Dalits, who rank at the bottom in India\u2019s ancient caste hierarchy, called the strike in protest against an attack by right-wing groups in the city of Pune, 150 km (95 miles) from Mumbai, on Monday.  The attack came as the community was celebrating the 200th anniversary of a battle they won, fighting alongside British colonial forces, against an upper-caste ruler. A 28-year-old man was killed in the clashes, according to the state government.      \u201cThe government didn\u2019t arrest the perpetrators of violence in Pune. Hindu group members were beating Dalits and the police were just watching from afar,\u201d said protester Sandeep Kamble. \u201cWe are demanding the arrest of the culprits.\u201d  Thousands of Dalits hurled stones and caused traffic disruption across Mumbai on Tuesday. Dalits have been ostracized by upper-caste Hindus for centuries for doing jobs they deemed as impure, such as working in tanneries and as picking garbage.  \u201cWe\u2019ve called for a bandh (shutdown), but we\u2019re not forcing people. They can join us or stay away,\u201d said Prakash Ambedkar, a leader of the Dalit community.   In parts of the Mumbai suburb of Thane, officials banned the assembly of crowds, small or large. Schools were closed in some cities, while internet access was also limited.  Fleet taxis, along with cab hailing services like Uber and Ola, were also largely off the roads in Mumbai on Wednesday, while several offices asked employees to work from home.

          "body": "FRANKFURT/VIENNA (Reuters) - A German court is likely to decide on Thursday whether to reverse the insolvency filing of airline Niki, according to a statement from Berlin\u2019s civil courts, which could derail the sale of the Air Berlin (AB1.DE) unit to Britain\u2019s IAG (ICAG.L).   Niki filed for insolvency last month after Germany\u2019s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) scrapped plans to buy the Austrian unit, grounding the airline\u2019s fleet and stranding thousands of passengers.  Following hurried talks to find a new owner for Niki before it loses its valuable runway slots, British Airways owner IAG agreed last Friday to buy the business and make it part of its low-cost unit Vueling.   But Fairplane, a group representing airline passengers, said on Tuesday it had filed legal cases to have the insolvency proceedings for Niki shifted to Austria from Germany, which could unravel the sale.   Fairplane argues that Niki, which is registered as a company in Austria, had been profitable but had lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December.  A court in Berlin\u2019s Charlottenburg must now decide whether to reverse its Dec. 13 decision opening insolvency proceedings for Niki or to pass on the case to a higher court, the Berlin court\u2019s statement on Wednesday said.  At the same time, an Austrian court has received a request to open insolvency proceedings for Niki in Austria, a spokesman for the Korneuburg court said on Wednesday, adding it would take the court until next week to assess the matter.  \u201cWe have to look at the jurisdiction first because this is a case currently pending with the Charlottenburg court,\u201d the spokesman said.

          "body": "FRANKFURT/VIENNA (Reuters) - A German court is likely to decide on Thursday whether to reverse the insolvency filing of airline Niki, according to a statement from Berlin\u2019s civil courts, which could derail the sale of the Air Berlin (AB1.DE) unit to Britain\u2019s IAG (ICAG.L).   Niki filed for insolvency last month after Germany\u2019s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) scrapped plans to buy the Austrian unit, grounding the airline\u2019s fleet and stranding thousands of passengers.  Following hurried talks to find a new owner for Niki before it loses its valuable runway slots, British Airways owner IAG agreed last Friday to buy the business and make it part of its low-cost unit Vueling.   But Fairplane, a group representing airline passengers, said on Tuesday it had filed legal cases to have the insolvency proceedings for Niki shifted to Austria from Germany, which could unravel the sale.   Fairplane argues that Niki, which is registered as a company in Austria, had been profitable but had lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December.  A court in Berlin\u2019s Charlottenburg must now decide whether to reverse its Dec. 13 decision opening insolvency proceedings for Niki or to pass on the case to a higher court, the Berlin court\u2019s statement on Wednesday said.  At the same time, an Austrian court has received a request to open insolvency proceedings for Niki in Austria, a spokesman for the Korneuburg court said on Wednesday, adding it would take the court until next week to assess the matter.  \u201cWe have to look at the jurisdiction first because this is a case currently pending with the Charlottenburg court,\u201d the spokesman said.

          "title": "Impressive Wozniacki continues march in Auckland",
          "body": "(Reuters) - Caroline Wozniacki continued to build on her WTA Finals victory late last year with another impressive performance on her way to a 6-2 6-2 victory over Croatia\u2019s Petra Martic to reach the quarter-finals of the Auckland Classic on Wednesday.  The Danish world number three ended 2017 with the biggest title of her career in Singapore and returned a day after thrashing Madison Brengle in her season opener to hit 21 winners against eight unforced errors in the 53-minute win over Martic.  \u201cI\u2019m trying to stay aggressive,\u201d Wozniacki said in a court-side interview. \u201cI still made some unforced errors. It\u2019s taking a few matches to play like 100 percent but I still felt I played pretty well today.\u201d  Top seed Wozniacki started brightly with a break of serve to love on her way to an early 3-0 lead and added another break in the eighth game to wrap up the opening set in just 24 minutes on a glorious day in New Zealand\u2019s largest city.  Martic tried to mount a comeback early in the second when she broke for a 2-0 lead but Wozniacki won the final six games behind impressive serving numbers, including six aces, to book a last eight encounter with young American Sofia Kenin.  \u201cI\u2019ve worked on everything I need to work on in the off-season,\u201d Wozniacki added as she continues her preparations for the Australian Open starting in Melbourne on Jan. 15.  \u201cNow it\u2019s just a matter of working out how to incorporate that into your match or into a situation where you maybe get nervous.\u201d  Kenin, a 19-year-old wild card, knocked out compatriot Varvara Lepchenko 6-4 7-6(6) earlier in the day and there were also victories for Taiwan\u2019s Hsieh Su-wei and Barbora Strycova.  Hsieh recorded a 6-4 6-3 triumph over Belgian qualifier Ysaline Bonaventure to set up a quarter-final clash against Strycova after the third seeded Czech edged out Sweden\u2019s Johanna Larsson 6-1 6-7(3) 6-2.   In the late matches, second seeded German Julia Goerges eased to a 6-4 6-0 victory over Slovakia\u2019s Viktoria Kuzmova to book a last eight tie against Slovenia\u2019s Polona Hercog, who was almost as ruthless in a 6-4 6-2 win over Kirsten Flipkens.  Former world number two Agnieszka Radwanska continued her strong start to the campaign with a 6-3 7-5 win over American Taylor Townsend, the Pole holding her nerve in a tight second set that lasted more than an hour to advance.  Fourth seed Radwanska, who remains on a collision course for a semi-final against Wozniacki, next faces American qualifier Sachia Vickery, who defeated Paraguay\u2019s Veronica Cepede Royg 6-2 6-4.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks scaled a more than six-year peak on Wednesday thanks to a tepid dollar and numbers showing the global economy was expanding at a healthy clip.  Turkish inflation data showed little sign of pressure on policymakers\u2019 easing.  With world stocks edging to another record high, MSCI\u2019s emerging market benchmark index advanced 0.6 percent to trade at its strongest since May 2011.  Bourses in Turkey and the Philippines romped to fresh historic records, while Chinese blue chips gained for the fourth session running. Thailand stocks traded at their strongest in 24-years while Hong Kong rose to a decade high and Russian dollar-stocks jumped more than 1 percent to their highest in 11 months.  Markets were buoyed by Tuesday\u2019s data showing healthy growth numbers across developed and emerging economies, which also gave a tailwind to commodities.  Adding to the emerging cheer was the dollar languishing close to the more than three months trough hit on Wednesday.  \u201cThe dollar is trading on a fairly weak footing at the moment which tends to be supportive for emerging markets, especially those with significant dollar debt like some of the Asian countries, but also Turkey and South Africa,\u201d said Jakob Christensen, head of EM research at Danske Bank.  South Africa\u2019s rand strengthened 0.7 percent, wiping out the previous day\u2019s losses, while Russia\u2019s rouble added 0.3 percent supported by Brent oil futures trading firmly above $66.  Turkey\u2019s lira strengthened 0.1 percent as data showed consumer prices rising 11.92 percent in December, exceeding expectations and coming in sharply above a government forecast, yet off the 14-year peak it had hit in November.  High inflation is one of the biggest challenges facing the Turkish economy, which has grown strongly after a short-lived downturn following a failed coup in July 2016.  \u201cFor the market it\u2019s important to see what it will mean for the central bank \u2013 do they have to react again? The market is probably taking the view that there will be higher rates,\u201d said Christensen.  Inflation data is also due in Poland later in the day - the first to release across the region, where numbers often move in tandem. Poland\u2019s figures are expected to show a decline in the annual inflation rate to 2.15 percent, which could hint at a possible later than projected monetary policy tightening in the region.  Emerging European currencies were broadly trading a touch weaker against the euro EURPLN=>, yet the losses followed recent multi-week and month highs.

          "body": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - Protests disrupted business in India\u2019s financial hub of Mumbai for a second day on Wednesday as lower-caste Dalits pelted buses, blocked rail lines and shut malls after a clash with right-wing Hindus.  Mumbai police advised people to avoid a number of key roads and intersections. Train services, the life line of the city, stalled throughout the day.  The Dalit call for a general strike across the western state of Maharashtra led to largely peaceful demonstrations. Police said protesters burned a few buses round the state, while dozens of buses and cars were damaged in Mumbai.      The Dalits, who rank at the bottom in India\u2019s ancient caste hierarchy, called the strike in protest against an attack by right-wing groups in the city of Pune, 150 km (95 miles) from Mumbai, on Monday.  The attack came as the community was celebrating the 200th anniversary of a battle they won, fighting alongside British colonial forces, against an upper-caste ruler. A 28-year-old man was killed in the clashes, according to the state government.      \u201cThe government didn\u2019t arrest the perpetrators of violence in Pune. Hindu group members were beating Dalits and the police were just watching from afar,\u201d said protester Sandeep Kamble. \u201cWe are demanding the arrest of the culprits.\u201d  Thousands of Dalits hurled stones and caused traffic disruption across Mumbai on Tuesday. Dalits have been ostracized by upper-caste Hindus for centuries for doing jobs they deemed as impure, such as working in tanneries and as picking garbage.  \u201cWe\u2019ve called for a bandh (shutdown), but we\u2019re not forcing people. They can join us or stay away,\u201d said Prakash Ambedkar, a leader of the Dalit community.   In parts of the Mumbai suburb of Thane, officials banned the assembly of crowds, small or large. Schools were closed in some cities, while internet access was also limited.  Fleet taxis, along with cab hailing services like Uber and Ola, were also largely off the roads in Mumbai on Wednesday, while several offices asked employees to work from home.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Ant Financial\u2019s plan to acquire U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) collapsed on Tuesday after a U.S. government panel rejected it over national security concerns, the most high-profile Chinese deal to be torpedoed under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.  The $1.2 billion deal\u2019s failure represents a blow for Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Chinese internet conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), who owns Ant Financial together with Alibaba executives. He was looking to expand Ant Financial\u2019s footprint amid fierce domestic competition from Chinese rival Tencent Holdings Ltd\u2019s (0700.HK) WeChat payment platform.   Ma, a Chinese citizen who appears frequently with leaders from the highest echelons of the Communist Party, had promised Trump in a meeting a year ago that he would create 1 million U.S. jobs.  MoneyGram shares fell 8.5 percent in after-market trading.  The companies decided to terminate their deal after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) rejected their proposals to mitigate concerns over the safety of data that can be used to identify U.S. citizens, according to sources familiar with the confidential discussions.  \u201cDespite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger,\u201d MoneyGram Chief Executive Alex Holmes said in a statement on Tuesday.  The U.S. government has toughened its stance on the sale of companies to Chinese entities, at a time when Trump is trying to put pressure on China to help tackle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues.  The MoneyGram deal is the latest in a string of Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies that have failed to clear CFIUS, including the $1.3 billion purchase by China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O).  In November, China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd (0715.HK) and Genworth Financial Inc (GNW.N) extended a deadline to April 1 for the Chinese group\u2019s planned $2.7 billion takeover of the U.S. life insurer.  Asked on Wednesday for Beijing\u2019s view on the deal\u2019s rejection, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said cooperation on economic and trade matters was of mutual benefit.  \u201cWe hope the U.S. can create a fair and predictable environment for Chinese enterprises to invest and start up businesses,\u201d the spokesman said.   However, commentary published after the deal\u2019s collapse by official news agency Xinhua went further, describing a fading bonhomie between the two countries, with the United States \u201cstuck in a zero-sum mentality\u201d.  \u201cChina and the United States are about to ride a bumpy journey in trade in 2018 if the U.S. government goes its own way, and retaliatory measures by China could be on the table,\u201d it said.  The MoneyGram deal\u2019s demise is also the latest example of how CFIUS\u2019 focus on cyber security and the integrity of personal data is prompting it to block deals in sectors not traditionally associated with national security, such as financial services.  The U.S. Treasury said it is prohibited by statute from disclosing information filed with CFIUS and declined to comment on the MoneyGram deal.   Other U.S. financial services deals by Chinese firms are waiting for approval from CFIUS, including HNA Group Co\u2019s acquisition of hedge fund-of-funds firm SkyBridge Capital LLC from Anthony Scaramucci, the Trump administration\u2019s former communications director.  SkyBridge and HNA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Dallas-based MoneyGram has approximately 350,000 remittance locations in more than 200 countries. Ant Financial was looking to take over MoneyGram not so much for its U.S. presence but to expand in growing markets outside of China.  Ant Financial and MoneyGram said they will now explore and develop initiatives to work together in remittance and digital payments in China, India, the Philippines and other Asian markets, as well as in the United States. This cooperation will take the form of commercial agreements, one of the sources said.  Any arrangements reached by Ant Financial and MoneyGram that do not involve a transaction would not be subject to review by CFIUS.  \u201cWhat is more likely to happen at this point is that MoneyGram will sell to another company, and one company that has shown interest in the past is Euronet,\u201d said Gil Luria, an equity analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.  Ant Financial agreed an $18 per share all-cash deal to acquire MoneyGram in April, seeing off competition from U.S.-based Euronet Worldwide Inc (EEFT.O), which had made an unsolicited offer for MoneyGram and openly lobbied U.S lawmakers, saying Ant\u2019s proposal created a national security risk.  \u201cEuronet continues to believe there is compelling commercial logic to a combination between Euronet and MoneyGram. However, significant developments have been disclosed by MoneyGram since Euronet\u2019s offer, and Euronet has not conducted any evaluation of the business in that time. While we continue to view a transaction with MoneyGram as logical, there is no guarantee any offer will be made or any transaction will ultimately occur,\u201d Euronet said in a statement.  Ant Financial said it paid MoneyGram a $30 million termination fee for the deal\u2019s collapse.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Neon has launched the first UK vehicle for insurance-linked securities (ILS) such as catastrophe bonds, the specialist insurer said on Wednesday.  Neon has set up NCM Re, a so-called protected cell company, which has issued a $72 million collateralised deal, it said in a statement.  Rules introduced late last year to allow the formation of UK protected cell companies for the issuance of ILS are designed to enable Britain to compete in the growing sector.  Catastrophe bonds and other ILS are typically tied to natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. They offer high yields but investors lose their principal if a specified catastrophe loss is triggered.  They offer an alternative to traditional reinsurance and have attracted investors such as pension funds and high net worth individuals because of their high yield.  Bermuda is the leading player in ILS but other European centres include Dublin and Gibraltar.  Reporting by Carolyn Cohn; editing by Jason Neely"

          "body": "(ADVISORY- Follow European and UK stock markets in real time on the Reuters Live Markets blog on Eikon, see cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=livemarkets)  * FTSE 100 down 0.1 pct  * Next leads retailers up after Christmas trading surprise  * U.S.-exposed stocks dented by dollar\u2019s decline  By Helen Reid  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Retailers stole the spotlight among UK stocks on Wednesday after Next delivered a strong Christmas update, as the FTSE 100 edged down from record highs.  Britain\u2019s main stock index dipped 0.1 percent, weighed down by financials stocks and consumer staples.  Next shone, however, jumping 8 percent to the top of the index after its trading update surprised investors, with a sales beat driving the company to upgrade its full-year profit forecast.  Cheery results from the first UK retailer to report on the crucial Christmas season caused a rally in retail stocks across the market, delivering relief to investors in a sector faced with significant challenges.  Next\u2019s update was in stark contrast to the start of 2017 when the retailer issued a profit warning and its shares sank. Wednesday gain brought it back to November levels before a third-quarter sales miss.  \u201cThe Next share price rollercoaster continues,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets.  \u201cManagement\u2019s update-by-update tinkering of guidance and sharp share price reactions only goes to reinforce how shareholders remain at the mercy of the UK consumer from one season to the next and exposed to short-termism.\u201d  The main non-food retailers drove the market, with Marks & Spencer up 2 percent while Primark owner ABF gained 2.6 percent.  Mid and small-caps also jumped on the retail rally and the more domestically-focused indexes rose 0.2 percent each.  Fashion retailer N Brown rose 7 percent to the top of the FTSE 250, and shares in small-cap department store Debenhams rose 3.8 percent.  Oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP, still feeling the glow from a remarkably strong start to the year for crude prices, also delivered a boost.  But the FTSE 100 stayed negative as the weightier financials and consumer staples sectors wilted.  Heavyweights Diageo, Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco fell 0.5 to 1 percent. The highly U.S.-exposed firms were dented by the decline in the dollar which sank to a near four-month low.  Financials were led lower by HSBC and Standard Chartered, the most internationally-exposed of the UK-listed banks which also suffer from a weaker dollar.  EU regulatory reforms under the MiFID II market directive that came into force on Wednesday had little early impact on the market, traders said.  Some suggested the wide-ranging new rules could distract investors from their trading desks as they adjusted to the change.  Reporting by Helen Reid; editing by John Stonestreet"

          "body": "NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, said Wednesday that it has agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle a U.S. class action brought by investors seeking to recoup money they claim to have lost as a result of a corruption scandal.  Petrobras, as the company is known, did not admit wrongdoing under the deal, which is one of the largest securities class action settlements in the United States. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must approve the settlement.  Investors sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused former executives at the company of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies.  Petrobras claimed it was itself a victim, but its market value plunged as the so-called Lava Jato or \u201ccar wash\u201d scandal deepened.  Petrobras said Wednesday that it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States over the scandal.  The deal does not include investors who bought non-U.S.-based Petrobras securities outside the United States, according to the company.  The deal came just days after Brazil\u2019s securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption.  According to a legal filing by the regulator on Friday, the accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drill ships.  Among the accused in CVM\u2019s filing are former Petrobras chief executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli.  The largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School\u2019s Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.

          "body": "* Stock markets globally start 2018 on cheerful note  * Another year of global growth expected as Europe shines  * Bond yields rise as end of monetary stimulus sighted  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Abhinav Ramnarayan  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - World stocks hit fresh highs on Wednesday with European markets joining the party as early indications suggest 2018 will be another year of synchronised global growth led by a shining European economy.  After its biggest one-day gain in more than two weeks on Tuesday, in the wake of its best year since 2009 in 2017, MSCI\u2019s index of global stocks, which tracks shares in 47 countries, pushed on to new record highs.  The pan-European stock index opened 0.3 percent higher, adding to gains for their Asian and the United States counterparts overnight as manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy.  The single currency was holding near a four-month high of $1.2081 hit on Tuesday.  \u201cInvestors have woken up in the new year and looked forward to another firm year for global growth with very muted downside risk,\u201d said Investec economist Philip Shaw, though he warned against reading too much into the first two trading days of the new year.  \u201cThe converse is the sell-off in bond markets: the idea that inflation pressures may be firmer than expected and central banks could take a slightly more aggressive approach than previously thought,\u201d he said.  For example, ECB rate-setter Ewald Nowotny told a German newspaper that the European Central Bank may end its stimulus programme this year if the euro zone economy continues to grow strongly.  Borrowing costs across the euro area stayed near recent highs: the yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year government bond - the benchmark for the region - was close to a two-month high at 0.46 percent.  Earlier in the session, Asian stocks struck a range of new peaks: a record high for Philippine stocks, a 24-year top for Thailand and a decade-high for Hong Kong.  MSCI\u2019s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4 percent, having jumped 1.4 percent on Tuesday in its best performance since last March.  This after Wall Street started the new year as it ended the old, scoring another set of record closing peaks. The Dow rose 0.42 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.83 percent and the Nasdaq 1.5 percent.  The gains in riskier assets came as industry surveys from India to Germany to Canada showed quickening activity.  \u201cThe breadth of the recovery is extraordinary,\u201d said Deutsche Bank macro strategist Alan Ruskin, noting that of 31 countries covered, only three failed to show growth while all the largest manufacturing sectors improved.  Elsewhere, spot gold reached its highest since mid-September at $1,321.33, before edging back to $1,313.81 per ounce.  Oil prices hit their highest since mid-2015, only to stall when major pipelines in Libya and the UK restarted and U.S production soared to the strongest in more than four decades.  Brent crude futures was trading flat at $66.57 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 nudged up 7 cents to $60.43 a barrel.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s smog-prone capital Beijing met its air quality targets last year following a crackdown on polluters and a sustained period of favorable weather, the local environmental agency said in a statement on Wednesday.  The yearly average concentrations of particulate matter with a length of 2.5 microns or less, known as PM2.5 and which damage the lungs when inhaled, dropped by 35.6 percent in 2017 from 2012 to 58 micrograms per cubic meter, the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau said.   The figures were in line with Reuters estimates made last week.  The Chinese capital was ordered to cut PM2.5 concentrations to less than 60 micrograms as part of a 2013 action plan designed to head off public anger about rising pollution.  The city has since closed nearly 2,000 factories in the cement, foundry and furniture-making sectors, shut down coal-fired power plants and eliminated over 2 million high-emission vehicles over the past five years.  Beijing, along with 27 other northern Chinese cities, is part of a government campaign that started in October to ensure the 2017 targets were met.  As the region prepared to switch on residential winter heating systems, it started phasing out coal-fired boilers and switching to gas- or electric-powered equipment. It has also shut or curbed production at heavy industrial plants to limit smog build-ups.  But the city\u2019s environment agency acknowledged that drier and windier weather conditions played a role in meeting air quality targets for the year, especially in the fourth quarter.   The government blamed bad weather for the near-record levels of smog last January and February, which saw PM2.5 readings spike by 26.7 percent in the key Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in the first quarter of 2017.  The province of Hebei, which surrounds Beijing and is a major source of smog drifting over the capital, also saw PM2.5 concentrations decline 7.1 percent from a year ago to 65 micrograms in 2017, the province\u2019s environmental protection bureau said on Tuesday.  But the region is still some distance away from meeting its official PM2.5 standard of 35 micrograms. The World Health Organization recommends levels of no more than 10 micrograms.  \u201cCurrent air pollutant levels remain a lot higher than the national air quality standard, indicating the improvement in air quality will still be a long-term process,\u201d Beijing\u2019s environment agency said.

          "title": "Fitch Downgrades Wanda to 'BB+'; Maintains Rating Watch Negative",
          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, January 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded Dalian Wanda Commercial Property Co. Ltd.'s (Wanda) Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR), senior unsecured rating and the rating of its outstanding US dollar senior notes to 'BB+' from 'BBB'. Fitch has also maintained the Rating Watch Negative (RWN) on the ratings. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. The two-notch downgrade reflects Wanda's inability to access offshore funding channels to boost its offshore liquidity in a timely manner. This has heightened its offshore liquidity risk beyond levels commensurate with an investment-grade credit profile. The risk is exacerbated by the absence of approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) to transfer onshore funds offshore. Wanda's ratings are supported by its strong onshore business profile that possesses high operating cash flow visibility from its rental income. The RWN reflects the continued lack of definitive funding channels in place to boost Wanda's offshore liquidity. Wanda's liquidity position may come under substantial pressure if its offshore syndicated loan lenders demand for early repayment and Wanda fails to meet these demands promptly; or it fails to raise sufficient offshore liquidity to repay the USD510 million second tranche of its offshore syndicated loan due in March 2018. This could trigger the cross-default clauses for the USD1.2 billion in senior notes, and add to repayment pressure. There may also be similar clauses in Wanda's other loans. Wanda's onshore local-currency notes also have various creditor protection measures that could be triggered by non-payment events. The Rating Watch will be resolved when there is more certainty about the company's ability to address its offshore liquidity needs. KEY RATING DRIVERS Difficulty Raising Offshore Funding: Wanda failed to issue offshore senior notes by the end of 2017 despite gaining the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) approval for USD1.5 billion in issuance quota. The issuance quota expired at end-2017 and Wanda will have to apply to extend the quota before it issues offshore notes with maturity of over one year. The uncertainty over the timing of the NDRC approval raises Wanda's offshore liquidity risks. Early Repayment of Offshore Loan: Wanda has a preliminary agreement to repay the USD1.7 billion syndicated loan in three instalments of USD170 million by end-November 2017, USD510 million by end-March 2018 and USD1 billion by end-May 2018. Wanda has already paid the first instalment, but has not indicated that it will negotiate new syndicated loans with lenders to fund the loan repayments while it explores other funding options. Wanda's offshore liquidity is not sufficient to repay the principal of the syndicated loan, and it has to rely on offshore refinancing or transfer funds from onshore. Uncertain Access to Onshore Funds: Wanda will have to rely on onshore funds to meet its offshore obligations if it fails to repay the syndicated loan or refinance its senior notes due November 2018 via offshore funding channels. Fitch believes that there is still uncertainty about the timing of the approval from SAFE to remit funds offshore. Wanda may be forced to sell its offshore assets at unfavourable prices if SAFE's approval to transfer onshore cash overseas does not materialise before its obligations under the guarantees given to the syndicated loans fall due. Overseas Market Exit: On 4 December 2017, Wanda announced its intention to sell its 65% stake in its Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, Wanda Hotel Development Company Limited, to Wanda Investment Holding Co. Limited, which is directly owned by Wanda's ultimate controlling shareholder, Mr. Wang Jianlin, at HKD1.2 per share, or a total consideration of over HKD3.6 billion. The transaction may boost Wanda's offshore liquidity provided Wanda receives payment offshore. However, this will eliminate some of the offshore funding options previously communicated to Fitch, such as disposing or pledging its equity interests in projects and subsidiaries. Fitch believes this is also a strong signal that Wanda is still under significant pressure to correct its previous aggressive expansion in the overseas market, and the company is likely to abandon its overseas expansion in the near future. Cross-Default Complications: Wanda's failure to resolve its immediate offshore debt obligations may lead to further repayment calls that will put pressure on its liquidity position. Wanda's USD1.2 billion in offshore bonds contain cross-default clauses that are likely to be triggered if it fails to pay any amount required, or if debts \"become due and payable prior to its stated maturity by reason of any actual default, event of default or the like\". Fitch does not discount the possibility of such clauses being included in its other borrowings. Risk of Multiple-Notch Downgrade: Further negative rating action may result if the cross-default clauses of Wanda's debts are triggered. This is despite Wanda having a large cash position of CNY107 billion at end-September 2017. Wanda had total debt at end-September 2017 of CNY218.5 billion that we estimate will drop to around CNY200 billion, assuming the proceeds from asset sales were received and used to pay down part of the onshore debt at end-2017. Bank and other loans, which are mostly secured borrowings, comprise over 60% of total borrowings after the asset disposal, and maintaining access to these funding sources remains critical to supporting Wanda's ratings. Strong Onshore Business: Wanda is China's largest shopping-mall operator by the number of properties it owns and its recurring income scale. Wanda has 211 Wanda Plazas in operation, with another 13 million sq m under construction that will add close to 100 Wanda Plazas. Compared with global peers, Wanda's 2016 rental EBITDA of CNY12.2 billion (USD1.8 billion) places it second behind US-based Simon Property Group, Inc. (A/Stable), and is higher than the USD1.6 billion EBITDA of France's Unibail-Rodamco SE (A/Rating Watch Negative) and Hong Kong-based Swire Properties Limited's (A/Stable) USD1.2 billion. DERIVATION SUMMARY Wanda's investment property business scale is comparable to major global investment properties companies like Simon Property, Unibail and Swire Properties. However, Wanda's recurring EBITDA/gross interest is less than 2.0x, compared with its peers' average of more than 5.5x. Its net debt/recurring EBITDA is weaker than Simon Property's and Swire Properties', but stronger than Unibail's. Wanda's rating is constrained by the lack of financial transparency at its parent, Dalian Wanda Group Co., Limited, which we estimate to have a materially weaker credit profile than Wanda. In addition, Wanda's early payment of its offshore syndicated loan and failure to take advantage of the USD1.5 billion offshore issuance quota in December 2017 has exposed Wanda to offshore liquidity risks that render its credit profile non-investment grade. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - 6% positive rental reversion each year - Balance of Wanda Plaza development land bank to be sold by 2020 - Trade payables to decline 55% by 2019 - Dividend paid to average CNY5 billion a year over the next five years RATING SENSITIVITIES The Rating Watch Negative will be resolved when there is more certainty about the company's ability to address its offshore liquidity needs. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action, Including a Multiple-Notch Downgrade - Wanda shows signs of difficulty in meeting its offshore liquidity needs or refinancing via offshore bonds by early March 2018; - Wanda fails to refinance the full amount of the syndicated loan before May 2018 or redeem the full amount of the USD600 million 4.875% offshore notes due November 2018 LIQUIDITY Liquidity Risk May Rise: Wanda's large liquidity position may still be insufficient if its total debt of more than CNY200 billion becomes due because of the cross-default clauses in various debt covenants are triggered, leading to acceleration of payment for all of its debt. Wanda had around CNY107 billion in available cash at end-September 2017, while its short-term debt was around CNY25 billion. Barring a debt acceleration scenario, Wanda's onshore liquidity remains adequate for the next 18 months. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Dalian Wanda Commercial Property Co.

The European Central Bank may end its bond buying programme this year if the euro zone economy continues to grow strongly, rate-setter Ewald Nowotny told a German newspaper in an interview released late on Tuesday, echoing comments by ECB board member Benoit Coeure at the weekend.  Yields on 10-year German government bonds traded near two months highs on Wednesday at 0.456 percent. Most other core euro zone yields were flat to a touch lower, having risen sharply on Tuesday.  Ireland is expected to kick off a very busy supply month for euro zone bonds with the launch of a 10-year syndicated issue later on Wednesday.  \u201cThe upcoming supply and the comments from ECB policymakers being on the hawkish side acted as a double whammy for rates yesterday overnight,\u201d said ING senior rates strategist Martin Van Vliet.  Unprecedented transparency obligations known as MiFID II - or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II - went into force on Wednesday, impacting European markets across the board.  Under the new rules, trades in financial assets and instruments must all be logged in a repository, forcing banks, asset managers and traders to report detailed information on trillions of euros of transactions.  With bond markets also on alert for Germany\u2019s December unemployment numbers and U.S Federal Reserve December meeting minutes due later in the day, the initial impact of the new regulatory regime was limited.  \u201cThere was little sign of an impact on trading volumes this morning,\u201d said ING\u2019s Van Vliet.  The new rules were delayed by a year due to their complexity, and regulators have had to issue eleventh-hour guidance to banks and financial firms to avoid trading freezes as well as calming nerves of those not yet fully compliant.

          "body": "* Pressure on dollar funding costs decline  * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  By Saikat Chatterjee  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The dollar held near a four-month low on Wednesday, having declined nearly 3 percent in the last three weeks as investors cut positions before manufacturing data and minutes of a December U.S. Federal Reserve meeting due later in the day.  Despite the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years passed by U.S. policymakers in late-December, market strategists are downbeat about the prospects of the dollar in the near term.  \u201cThe key question for markets is what is the game changer for the dollar in the short term and unless we see a significant pick up in inflation, the dollar will remain on the back foot,\u201d said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.  The greenback was broadly flat on the day at 91.937 against a trade-weighted basket of currencies.  Other seasonal factors were also at play such as a broad decline in dollar funding requirements over the thin-year period which typically acts as a support for the greenback.  BNP Paribas strategists said dollar funding pressures as noted by cross-currency basis swaps peaked earlier than usual in December and has eased dramatically in recent days, eroding a key support.  Euro/dollar cross-currency basis swaps for three-month maturities settled at its tightest levels in nearly three years at 22.5 basis points, indicating that broad demand for dollars was muted..  The euro was flirting near a four-month high hit on Tuesday prompted by optimism over the euro zone\u2019s economy and expectations the European Central Bank will wind down its bond-buying stimulus in 2018.  The ECB board member in charge of the central bank\u2019s market operations, Benoit Coeure, said at the weekend he saw a \u201creasonable chance\u201d bond purchases would not be extended beyond September.  The single currency was trading at $1.2040 after hitting a four-month high of $1.2081 on Tuesday, marking a gain of roughly 3 percent from a mid-December trough and bringing it close to a September high of $1.2092, the currency\u2019s highest level since early 2015.  Among data due later in the session is manufacturing ISM data in the United States and minutes of the December U.S. central bank meeting.

          "body": "(Adds graphic)  By Hyunjoo Jin and Haejin Choi  SEOUL, Jan 3 (Reuters) - North Korea reopened a border hotline with Seoul on Wednesday to discuss sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea\u2019s Pyeongchang next month.  Should the North attend the event, the two Koreas may march under a single flag at a sports opening ceremony for the first time in more than a decade and even compete as a single nation, experts and officials have suggested.  Such a move would be a powerful symbol of reconciliation amid a tense standoff over Pyongyang\u2019s defiant pursuit of nuclear and missiles programmes.  Games organising chief Lee Hee-beom previously raised the possibility of the two Koreas forming unified teams in figure skating and ice hockey for the Games to be held in the mountain village of Pyeongchang, just 80 km (50 miles) from the inter-Korean border.  The two Koreas have competed as a single nation in international table tennis and soccer games before but have never joined forces for multi-sports events such as the Olympics or Asian Games. South and North Korea marched together at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics for the first time, after the two Koreas held its first-ever summit under South Korea\u2019s liberal Kim Dae-jung government.  Lee, president of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, also proposed North Korean athletes entering the South by crossing the heavily armed land border between the two Koreas.  That would be the first time that North Korean athletes would arrive the South by road, the organizer said. North Korea has not responded to Lee\u2019s proposals.  North Korea participated in the international multi-sports events hosted by South Korea three times - in 2002, 2003 and 2014.  The North boycotted the Seoul Olympics held in 1988. Nine months before those Games, North Korean agents detonated a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858, killing all 104 passengers and 11 crew.  2002 ASIAN GAMES, BUSAN (Sept 29-Oct 14)  North Korea sent a 606-member delegation, including 184 athletes, 288 cheerleaders and 134 officers to the 2002 Asian Games in the South Korean port city of Busan.  Athletes from the two Koreas paraded together at the opening and closing ceremonies, a spectacle not seen since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China as relations chilled under nearly a decade of conservative rule in the South.  The contingent traveled to the via North Korean flights and a cruise ship, using the vessel as their accommodation.  The female cheerleaders proved a huge attraction in South Korea with their good looks and tightly choreographed gymnastic routines, and became a feature of subsequent events in 2004 and 2005. Ri Sol Ju, now North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s wife, came to South Korea in 2005 as a North Korean cheerleader for the Asian Athletics Championships in Incheon, a lawmaker previously told reporters after being briefed by intelligence officials.  2003 SUMMER UNIVERSIADE, DAEGU (Aug 21-Aug 31)  A combined 528 North Koreans, including 303 cheerleaders and 94 athletes, attended the Games. The two Koreas marched together at the ceremonies.  North Korean athletes flew into South Korea and stayed at Daegu Bank Institute, a training facility for the local bank.  2014 ASIAN GAMES, INCHEON (Sept 19-Oct 4)  Pyongyang sent a total of 273 North Korean athletes and officials to the Games. They stayed at the athletes\u2019 village.  But Pyongyang dropped its plan to send a cheerleading squad amid deteriorating inter-Korean relations under the previous Park Geun-hye administration. Ahead of the Games, the North also threatened to pull out of the event, accusing the South of plotting to block its athletes from taking part.  The two Koreas did not march together at the ceremonies.  The North sent its most senior delegation ever to attend its closing ceremony with just 24 hours\u2019 notice. Kim allowed three of his top aides to fly aboard his personal jet to attend the event, while the athletes, who arrived in five installments including from Japan and Switzerland, took regular commercial flights of North Korea\u2019s Air Koryo.

          "body": "* FCA investigates statements, including July profit warning  * Company says cooperating with investigation  * Crisis-hit Carillion made three profit warnings last year (Adds shares, details, background)  By Arathy S Nair  Jan 3 (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is investigating statements made by Carillion over seven months up to and including a profit warning last July, the struggling building and services company said on Wednesday.  Carillion, which is involved in major infrastructure projects for the British and other governments, has been fighting for its survival after costly contract delays and a downturn in new business. In November it issued its third profit warning in five months.  The investigation by the markets watchdog concerns \u201cthe timeliness and content of announcements made by Carillion between Dec. 7 2016 and July 10 2017,\u201d the company said in a brief statement to the London Stock Exchange.  Carillion said it was cooperating fully with the FCA.  In the period under review, Carillion released a full year trading update, its 2016 results, an annual general meeting statement and a 2017 first-half trading update. Its shares fell more than 54 percent over the seven months.  The company announced on July 10 it would undertake a review of its business, suspended its dividend, announced divestments and said it expected overall performance to be below management\u2019s previous expectations.  Carillion also said then that Richard Howson would step down as chief executive and named Keith Cochrane as interim CEO.  Analysts estimate the company is also grappling with debt including provisions, pensions and accounts payable of about 1.5 billion pounds ($2.04 billion).  Carillion\u2019s shares were down 3 percent at 17.4 pence by 0835 GMT, making up some lost ground after falling more than 8 percent. They have lost 90 percent of their value since the profit warning on July 10. Carillion\u2019s market capitalisation stands at about 70 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Carillion and FCA declined to provide any additional details on the investigation.  Carillion last month moved forward the start date for new chief executive Andrew Davies forward to Jan. 22 from April 2.  Davies, head of family-owned builder Wates Group and formerly with defence company BAE Systems, will replace interim CEO Cochrane.

          "body": "(Recasts on Refresco comment, adds detail)  By Ben Martin  LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Drinks bottler Refresco is willing to offer remedies to concerns voiced by Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) over the Dutch company\u2019s $1.25 billion acquisition of Cott Corp\u2019s bottling activities.  The CMA, which has undertaken an initial investigation of the deal, said on Wednesday that it had concluded the purchase could result in higher prices or lead to lower quality standards for some juice drinks that both companies supply in the UK.  Refresco said in a separate statement that it was prepared to offer \u201csuitable remedies\u201d to the CMA and would fully cooperate with the watchdog. The regulator had warned that it would refer the deal for an in-depth investigation unless undertakings were made by the Dutch bottling business to assuage its concerns.  \u201cWith the clearance we received earlier in the process from the U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities and the overwhelming support from our shareholders, we are willing to propose remedies to the CMA to address this specific issue and put us on the right track to also obtain clearance in the UK,\u201d said Refresco Chief Executive Hans Roelofs.  Refresco agreed to buy Canada-based Cott\u2019s production business in July in a move that bolsters its operations in the United States, the world\u2019s biggest soft drinks market.  When the deal was announced Roelofs said that Refresco would be a \u201cleading company in a very fragmented market and absolutely No.1 in the United States and UK\u201d.  The juice drinks that have drawn the attention of the British regulator are made using a special aseptic production process, enabling them to be sold without refrigeration and preservatives, Refresco said on Wednesday. It added that the products are produced by two factories in the UK, one a Cott site and the other operated by Refresco.  \u201cOnly one other competitor in the UK currently supplies third parties with juice drinks using this production process,\u201d the British regulator said. \u201cThe CMA is therefore concerned that, after the merger, the combined business might be able to increase prices or lower quality standards.\u201d  Since striking the Cott deal, Refresco agreed to a 1.6 billion euro ($1.93 billion) takeover by a consortium led by PAI Partners, the French private equity firm, in October. It had rejected an earlier offer from PAI, in April last year, and denied that the Cott acquisition was a defensive measure against a takeover.

Fortuna, which operates in the Czech, Slovak, Polish, Romanian and Croatian markets, said the offer would be announced on Wednesday and would involve delisting the shares in Prague and Warsaw.  \u201c(Fortuna\u2019s) boards fully support and recommend the offer for acceptance... and also recommend voting in favour of Fortuna making the delisting application,\u201d Fortuna said.  The shares were up 1.1 percent at 180.5 crowns in Prague at 0824 GMT.  Fortbet\u2019s offer would value Fortuna at 9.49 billion crowns ($447.83 million) and subscription is planned for Jan. 23 to Feb. 23, Fortuna said.  Fortbet, part of Czech-Slovak investment group Penta Investments, already owns 79.8 percent of Fortuna.  The offer would be Fortbet\u2019s second bid to gain full control after a buyout in the first half of 2017 raised its stake from a 68 percent share.  Fortuna said in its statement a delisting would free it from public disclosures that it said left it at a disadvantage to competitors.  Being unlisted would make it easier to take advantage of market opportunities and be more aggressive in acquisitions, as well as cost savings, it said.  Fortbet sent Fortuna an indicative offer of 170 crowns per share at the beginning of December and agreed to raise the offer, Fortuna said.  The offer price assumes no dividends for 2017 are paid.  Fortuna\u2019s second biggest shareholder, Templeton Asset Management, did not take part in the first offer. Its representatives could not be reached for immediate comment.  Fortuna reported a 78 percent rise in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to 28.3 million euros for the first nine months of 2017.

          "title": "Exclusive: South Korea to look at boosting outflows if won rally continues - sources",
          "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will look at ways to direct capital flows offshore if the won KRW= continues to soar, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could take heat out of the currency without upsetting Washington over the thorny topic of foreign exchange management.  Asia\u2019s fourth largest economy is highly reliant on shipments of high-end goods such as ships, automobiles and electronics for its growth but also had one of the region\u2019s hottest currencies in 2017, which has weighed on its export competitiveness.  People familiar with matter told Reuters on Wednesday the nation\u2019s foreign exchange authorities may look into ways to spur investment abroad should the local currency appreciate on a consistent basis.  This would be separate to regulators\u2019 market operations to curb the won\u2019s volatility, which would still be conducted when required.  A spokesperson for the finance ministry, which is responsible for foreign exchange regulation, declined to comment on the matter.  The sources did not provide details on the potential measures and declined to elaborate when asked if the steps could include tax breaks similar to those announced in 2015.  Back then, South Korea offered up to 10 years in tax exemptions on investment gains from funds that put more than 60 percent of assets into overseas stocks. The scheme took effect in February 2016 and expired in December.  Rising domestic interest rates, strong exports and heightened U.S. scrutiny on South Korea\u2019s foreign exchange regime have made it harder for Seoul to tame the won, which rose 13 percent last year, its best annual gain in 13 years.  Measures that encourage capital out of the country could help policymakers remove some of the upward pressure on the currency without needing to use direct intervention in the foreign exchange market, a sticking point in Seoul\u2019s relations with the Washington.  South Korea posted current account surpluses for 68 straight months through to October last year, data from the Bank of Korea showed.  In October, the U.S. Treasury Department kept South Korea on a \u201cmonitoring list\u201d of countries in its report on foreign exchange policies of its major trading partners, along with China, Japan and Germany.  In value terms, South Korean exports surged to their highest on record in 2017 thanks to soaring global demand for memory chips, cars and petrochemical products.  The government sees exports growing 4 percent this year, slowing from the 15.8 percent growth in 2017. In terms of the value of goods sold, South Korea exported $573.9 billion in 2017, marking it the best year since 1956 when such records began.  At the same time, the strong won has been a point of pain for local manufacturers.  A think tank from Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) last month flagged risks from the won\u2019s strength against the Japanese yen, warning current levels could hurt demand for South Korean cars in markets such as Europe and the U.S. in the year ahead.  Citing its Hyundai Sonata sedan as example, Lee Bo-sung, a director at the think tank, said the model was only 2 percent cheaper than Honda\u2019s Accord as of 2017 in the U.S. market, compared with 10 percent in 2011.  The won snapped six days of gains and weakened 0.3 percent against the dollar on Wednesday but closed just below its three-year high of 1,064.5 per dollar, hit on Tuesday.

          "body": "LUSAKA (Reuters) - Zambia\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister Harry Kalaba has resigned, he said on his Facebook page, as a struggle in the ruling Patriotic Front (PF) over President Edgar Lungu\u2019s ambitions to run for another term in office intensifies.  Kalaba is seen as a potential PF candidate in a 2021 presidential election but analysts say his chances of winning the PF nomination may stall if Lungu wins a court battle allowing him to run for a third term.  \u201cWe cannot  proceed to manage national affairs with cold indifference when the levels of corruption are swelling and being perpetrated by those who are expected to be the solution,\u201d Kalaba said in a Facebook post late on Tuesday.  Presidential spokesman Amos Chanda told Reuters State House had not received Kalaba\u2019s resignation letter.  Experts said Kalaba\u2019s resignation was intended to apply pressure on Lungu who is accused by his opponents of chasing an unconstitutional third term.  \u201cPeople have started realizing that they will not get nominated as long as Lungu insists on standing,\u201d Lee Habasonda, an analyst from the University of Zambia, told Reuters.  Zambia\u2019s constitution limits presidents to two terms but Lungu argues that his first period as leader doesn\u2019t count because he did not serve a full term after he assumed power following the death of predecessor Michael Sata in 2014.  Lungu was then elected for a five-year term in 2016.  Lungu in November warned constitutional court judges not to stop him running again and his allies have asked the Supreme Court to confirm that he will be eligible to stand.

          "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing is planning to build a 13.8 billion yuan ($2.12 billion) artificial intelligence development park in the city\u2019s west, the official Xinhua news agency reported, as China pushes ahead to fulfill its ambition to become a world leader in AI by 2025.  The AI park will house up to 400 enterprises and have an estimated annual output of 50 billion yuan, Xinhua said, citing a report from authorities in Beijing\u2019s Mentougou district.   Zhongguancun Development Group, the developer of the project, will look to partner with foreign universities and build a \u201cnational-level\u201d AI lab in the area, Xinhua added.  Zhongguancun Development and representatives for Beijing\u2019s Mentougou district could not be immediately reached for comment.  China\u2019s plan to fast-track AI development comes amid heightened tensions between Beijing and the United States over the competitive applications of AI in military technology.   China aims to grow the local industry to over 150 billion yuan by 2020 and 400 billion yuan by 2025, according to the State Council.  Locally, China has unveiled a series of plans to bolster talent, investment and research in AI, urging private, public and military firms to cooperate on national AI goals in a development roadmap released in 2017.   The country\u2019s burgeoning AI industry has also attracted foreign firms. Last month, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google announced it would launch a Beijing-based AI research team, targeting local research talent, even though the U.S. firm\u2019s search engine remains blocked behind China\u2019s firewall.  The new AI park will focus on attracting enterprises that work on big-data, biometric identification, deep learning and cloud computing, the Xinhua report said on Wednesday.    Beijing also recently released blueprints for an autonomous driving zone on the city\u2019s outskirts, dedicated to testing and developing local autonomous vehicles.

          "body": "SEOUL, Jan 3 (Reuters) - North Korea reopened a border hotline with Seoul on Wednesday to discuss sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea\u2019s Pyeongchang next month.  Should the North attend the event, the two Koreas may march under a single flag at a sports opening ceremony for the first time in more than a decade and even compete as a single nation, experts and officials have suggested.  Such a move would be a powerful symbol of reconciliation amid a tense standoff over Pyongyang\u2019s defiant pursuit of nuclear and missiles programmes.  Games organising chief Lee Hee-beom previously raised the possibility of the two Koreas forming unified teams in figure skating and ice hockey for the Games to be held in the mountain village of Pyeongchang, just 80 km (50 miles) from the inter-Korean border.  The two Koreas have competed as a single nation in international table tennis and soccer games before but have never joined forces for multi-sports events such as the Olympics or Asian Games. South and North Korea marched together at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics for the first time, after the two Koreas held its first-ever summit under South Korea\u2019s liberal Kim Dae-jung government.  Lee, president of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, also proposed North Korean athletes entering the South by crossing the heavily armed land border between the two Koreas.  That would be the first time that North Korean athletes would arrive the South by road, the organizer said. North Korea has not responded to Lee\u2019s proposals.  North Korea participated in the international multi-sports events hosted by South Korea three times - in 2002, 2003 and 2014.  The North boycotted the Seoul Olympics held in 1988. Nine months before those Games, North Korean agents detonated a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858, killing all 104 passengers and 11 crew.  2002 ASIAN GAMES, BUSAN (Sept 29-Oct 14)  North Korea sent a 606-member delegation, including 184 athletes, 288 cheerleaders and 134 officers to the 2002 Asian Games in the South Korean port city of Busan.  Athletes from the two Koreas paraded together at the opening and closing ceremonies, a spectacle not seen since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China as relations chilled under nearly a decade of conservative rule in the South.  The contingent traveled to the via North Korean flights and a cruise ship, using the vessel as their accommodation.  The female cheerleaders proved a huge attraction in South Korea with their good looks and tightly choreographed gymnastic routines, and became a feature of subsequent events in 2004 and 2005. Ri Sol Ju, now North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s wife, came to South Korea in 2005 as a North Korean cheerleader for the Asian Athletics Championships in Incheon, a lawmaker previously told reporters after being briefed by intelligence officials.  2003 SUMMER UNIVERSIADE, DAEGU (Aug 21-Aug 31)  A combined 528 North Koreans, including 303 cheerleaders and 94 athletes, attended the Games. The two Koreas marched together at the ceremonies.  North Korean athletes flew into South Korea and stayed at Daegu Bank Institute, a training facility for the local bank.  2014 ASIAN GAMES, INCHEON (Sept 19-Oct 4)  Pyongyang sent a total of 273 North Korean athletes and officials to the Games. They stayed at the athletes\u2019 village.  But Pyongyang dropped its plan to send a cheerleading squad amid deteriorating inter-Korean relations under the previous Park Geun-hye administration. Ahead of the Games, the North also threatened to pull out of the event, accusing the South of plotting to block its athletes from taking part.  The two Koreas did not march together at the ceremonies.  The North sent its most senior delegation ever to attend its closing ceremony with just 24 hours\u2019 notice. Kim allowed three of his top aides to fly aboard his personal jet to attend the event, while the athletes, who arrived in five installments including from Japan and Switzerland, took regular commercial flights of North Korea\u2019s Air Koryo.

The operation, centered in Istanbul and encompassing nine provinces, targeted \u201cclass A\u201d shareholders who had voting rights to determine the bank\u2019s administrative board, police said.  The state-run Anadolu news agency said 49 of the suspects had been detained so far.  Bank Asya was founded by followers of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, and was seized by the state in 2015 along with other Gulen-linked companies in a government crackdown.  The government says Gulen masterminded the 2016 attempted coup, in which more than 240 people, many of them unarmed civilians, were killed by rogue soldiers. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied the charges and condemned the coup.  Since the abortive putsch, more than 50,000 people, including civil servants and security personnel, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs.

          "body": "(Reuters) - Gold prices edged down on Wednesday after hitting a 3-1/2-month high, as the dollar recovered from its lows and technical indicators pointed to a short-term correction.  Spot gold fell 0.4 percent to $1,312.35 an ounce at 0257 GMT. The precious metal earlier hit $1,321.33, its highest level since Sept. 15.  U.S. gold futures were mostly unchanged at $1,315.60 an ounce.   \u201cRelative strength index shows the metal at overbought levels, which may lead to short term selling,\u201d ScotiaMocatta analysts said in a research note.  The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) for spot gold touched 75 on Tuesday, it highest since September 2017. An RSI above 70 indicates a commodity is overbought and could lead to a price correction.  The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1 percent at 91.964 after falling to a more than three-month low Tuesday.   The dollar posted its biggest annual drop since 2003 in 2017, helping gold to an annual increase of more than 13 percent. Bullion surged $55 an ounce in the last three weeks of 2017 alone.  Gold\u2019s medium-term outlook appeared positive, analysts said.  \u201cAt this moment we are expecting some kind of inflationary expectations. People are more optimistic with stock rally are also expecting returns in commodities including gold,\u201d said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong\u2019s Wing Fung Financial Group.  \u201cWe should tap the short term opportunities to go long as gold has crossed $1,300 with a momentum. It may act as a support, while $1,340 could be an immediate resistance level and we might reach $1,400 in the first quarter this year.\u201d  Spot gold may break a resistance at $1,326 per ounce and rise towards the next resistance at $1,380 in three months, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.  Later on Wednesday, investors will turn their attention to the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy meeting, when it raised interest rates for the third time in 2017.  Further cues are likely from U.S. economic data this week, including jobs figures on Friday.  Among other precious metals, spot palladium fell 0.1 percent to $1,090.80 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday at $1,096.50   The metal, which soared 57 percent in 2017, has been surging on fears of short supplies.   Analysts expect that about 80 percent of global palladium demand will come from autocatalysts for gasoline-powered cars, which many consumers now prefer over diesel-fuelled vehicles.       Spot silver fell 0.8 percent to $17.05 an ounce, after hitting a six-week high at $17.21 earlier in the session.  Spot platinum fell 0.8 percent to $936.10 an ounce.

The dollar posted its biggest annual drop since 2003 in 2017, helping gold to an annual increase of more than 13 percent. Bullion surged $55 an ounce in the last three weeks of 2017 alone.  Gold\u2019s medium-term outlook appeared positive, analysts said.  \u201cAt this moment we are expecting some kind of inflationary expectations. People are more optimistic with stock rally are also expecting returns in commodities including gold,\u201d said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong\u2019s Wing Fung Financial Group.  \u201cWe should tap the short term opportunities to go long as gold has crossed $1,300 with a momentum. It may act as a support, while $1,340 could be an immediate resistance level and we might reach $1,400 in the first quarter this year.\u201d  Spot gold may break a resistance at $1,326 per ounce and rise towards the next resistance at $1,380 in three months, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.  Later on Wednesday, investors will turn their attention to the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy meeting, when it raised interest rates for the third time in 2017.  Further cues are likely from U.S. economic data this week, including jobs figures on Friday.  Among other precious metals, spot palladium fell 0.1 percent to $1,090.80 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday at $1,096.50   The metal, which soared 57 percent in 2017, has been surging on fears of short supplies.   Analysts expect that about 80 percent of global palladium demand will come from autocatalysts for gasoline-powered cars, which many consumers now prefer over diesel-fuelled vehicles.       Spot silver fell 0.8 percent to $17.05 an ounce, after hitting a six-week high at $17.21 earlier in the session.  Spot platinum fell 0.8 percent to $936.10 an ounce.

          "body": "LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Regulators have granted a last-minute reprieve to three clearing houses in Germany and Britain from having to give customers more choice under new European Union market rules that come into effect on Wednesday.  One of the aims of the rules, known as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II, is to make it easier for people to choose where to clear the listed derivatives contracts they buy and sell.  This would be done through the \u201copen access\u201d rule, which stops any requirement to clear a derivative contract within the same exchange group that traded the contract.  But Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it received applications for an open-access waiver from ICE Futures Europe and from the London Metal Exchange.  This means the exchanges would not yet have to make changes to allow customers to clear contracts elsewhere.  The FCA said it has decided to grant transitional arrangements in the interests of ensuring there is an \u201corderly functioning market\u201d.  \u201cAccordingly, with effect from 3 January 2018, ICE Futures Europe and LME will not be required to consider open-access requests ... as they relate to exchange-traded derivatives, until the expiry of the transitional period on 3 July 2020.\u201d  BaFin, the German markets regulator, announced late on Tuesday that it had granted the same time-limited waiver to Deutsche Boerse\u2019s Eurex Clearing arm.  Open access has been a feature of share trading and clearing for many years, but its introduction to listed derivatives has proved divisive.  Some EU policymakers and Deutsche Boerse had warned about financial stability risks from opening up derivatives clearing to competition, but critics had said this was an excuse to prevent competition.

          "body": "MUMBAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Many businesses in the Indian financial hub of Mumbai closed on Wednesday as protesters from a low-caste community blocked traffic and shopping malls and staged sit-ins on railway lines after clashes with right-wing Hindus.  The call for a general strike across the western state of Maharashtra led to largely peaceful protests, but life in many parts of Mumbai was disrupted with Dalits pelting buses with stones and deflating tyres in some areas. Railway lines and some major roads leading into the city were blocked.  The Dalits, who rank at the bottom in India\u2019s ancient caste hierarchy, called the strike in protest against attacks from right-wing groups in the city of Pune on Monday. The strike shut businesses and schools in Mumbai and other cities across the state.  \u201cThe government didn\u2019t arrest the perpetrators of violence in Pune. Hindu group members were beating Dalits and the police were just watching from afar,\u201d said protester Sandeep Kamble. \u201cWe are demanding the arrest of the culprits.\u201d  The protest came a day after thousands of Dalits hurled stones and caused traffic disruption across Mumbai. Dalits have been ostracized by upper-caste Hindus for centuries for jobs they deemed as impure, such as garbage pickers and tannery workers.  Those protests followed celebrations by Dalits in Pune, 150 km (95 miles) from Mumbai, on the 200th anniversary of a battle they won, fighting alongside British colonial forces, against an upper-caste ruler. Those celebrations were disrupted by right wing Hindu groups and a 28-year-old man was killed in the clashes, according to the state government.  In parts of the Mumbai suburb of Thane, officials banned the assembly of crowds, small or large, to control protesters, who disrupted road and rail services during the morning rush hour.  Schools were closed in some cities and internet service was down in places to restrict social media access and the spread of rumours.  Fleet taxis, along with cab hailing services like Uber and Ola, were also largely off the roads in Mumbai on Wednesday. Several offices asked employees to work from home.

The company said in a statement on Wednesday it had received certificates from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) at the end of 2017. In May 2016, FGV voluntarily withdrew the RSPO certificates from its 58 processing mills to correct sustainability issues in its supply chain.  \u201cIn 2018, we aim to certify another eight mill complexes by March and more than 30 mill complexes will have been audited by RSPO and the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) by end of December,\u201d said FGV Chief Executive Officer Zakaria Arshad in the statement.  FGV also aims to gain RSPO and MSPO certification at its 70 palm oil mill complexes by the end of 2021, the company said.  The RSPO is a body of consumers, green groups and plantation firms that promotes the use of sustainable palm oil products.  Palm oil is one of the world\u2019s most commonly used vegetable oils, used to make everything from soap and cosmetics to chocolate and cooking oil. The industry is often blamed for deforestation and occurrences of haze in Southeast Asia because of the smoke caused by open burning to clear land.

          "title": "Exclusive: Pakistan plans takeover of charities run by Islamist figure U.S. has targeted",
          "body": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan\u2019s government plans to seize control of charities and financial assets linked to Islamist leader Hafiz Saeed, who Washington has designated a terrorist, according to officials and documents reviewed by Reuters.  Pakistan\u2019s civilian government detailed its plans in a secret order to various provincial and federal government departments on Dec. 19, three officials who attended one of several\u00a0high-level\u00a0meeting discussing the crackdown told Reuters.  Marked \u201csecret\u201d, a Dec. 19 document from the finance ministry directed law enforcement and governments in Pakistan\u2019s five provinces to submit an action plan by Dec. 28 for a \u201ctakeover\u201d of Saeed\u2019s two charities, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and the Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation.\u00a0  The United States has labeled JuD and FIF\u00a0\u201cterrorist fronts\u201d\u00a0for Lashkar-e-Taiba (\u201cArmy of\u00a0the Pure\u201d or LeT), a group Saeed founded in 1987 and which Washington and India blame for the 2008 attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people.  Saeed has repeatedly denied involvement in the Mumbai attacks and a Pakistani court saw insufficient evidence to convict him. The LeT could not be reached for comment.\u00a0  The Dec. 19 document, which refers to \u201cFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) issues\u201d, names only Saeed\u2019s two charities and \u201cactions to be taken\u201d against them.  The FATF, an international body that combats money laundering and terrorist financing, has warned Pakistan it faces inclusion on a watch list for failing to crack down on financing terrorism.  Asked about a crackdown on JuD and FIF, Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who co-chaired one of the meetings on the plan, responded only generally, saying he has ordered authorities \u201cto choke the fundraising of all proscribed outfits in Pakistan\u201d.   In a written reply to Reuters, he also said Pakistan wasn\u2019t taking action under U.S. pressure. \u201cWe\u2019re not pleasing anyone. We\u2019re working as a responsible nation to fulfill our obligations to our people and international community.\u201d  In response to the Reuters article, JuD spokesman Yahya Mujahid said the organization will go to court if the government decides to take over JuD and FIF.  \u201cWe will not keep silent. We will fight a legal battle,\u201d Mujahid said in statement, terming the government move illegal.  Saeed could not be reached for comment. He has frequently denied having ties to militants and says the charitable organizations he founded and controls have no terrorism ties. He says he promotes an Islamic-oriented government through doing good works.  On Monday, some of the first directives from the proposed crackdown were put in place.  The country\u2019s financial regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), issued an order that \u201cprohibits\u201d all companies from donating money to Saeed, LeT, JuD, FiF and other groups and individuals who are named on the U.N. Security Council sanctions lists.  In the capital Islamabad, the district magistrate banned proscribed organizations from \u201cfund-raising in any kind and social, political, welfare and religious activities by these groups\u201d, according to an order reviewed by Reuters.  The two-month ban, which can be extended, was put into place \u201cto curb the terrorist acts and assistance activities carried out by the proscribed organizations and their subsidiary welfare wings,\u201d the document said.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the government follows through with the plan, it would mark the first time Pakistan has made a major move against Saeed\u2019s network, which includes 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services. The JuD and FIF alone have about 50,000 volunteers and hundreds of other paid workers, according to two counter-terrorism officials.  Participants at the meeting raised the possibility that the government\u2019s failure to act against the charities could lead to U.N. sanctions, one of the three officials said. A U.N. Security Council team is due to visit Pakistan in late January to review progress against U.N.-designated \u201cterrorist\u201d groups.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAny adverse comments or action suggested by the team can have far-reaching implications for Pakistan,\u201d the official said.  The Dec. 19 document gave few details about how the state would take over Saeed\u2019s charities, pending the plans submitted from the provincial governments. It did say it would involve government entities taking over ambulance services and accounting for other vehicles used by the charities.   It says law enforcement agencies will coordinate\u00a0with Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agencies to identify the assets of the two charities and examine how they raise money.  The document also directs that the name of JuD\u2019s 200-acre headquarters, Markaz-e-Taiba, near the eastern city of Lahore be changed to something else \u201cto make it known that\u00a0the Government of \u201cPunjab (province) solely manages and operates the Markaz(headquarters)\u201d.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The move to seize the charities could spark some concern from the powerful military, which has proposed plans to steer Saeed and the JuD into mainstream politics. The military did not respond to a request for comment.   In August, JuD officials formed a new political party, the Milli Muslim League, and backed candidates who fared relatively strongly in two key parliamentary by-elections.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The JuD\u00a0publicly disavows armed militancy inside Pakistan, but offers vocal support for the cause of rebel fighters in Indian-administered Kashmir and has called for Pakistan to retake Kashmir. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the disputed region.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Washington, which has offered a $10 million reward for information leading to Saeed\u2019s conviction over the Mumbai attacks, warned Islamabad of repercussions after a Pakistani court in late November released him from house arrest.  Punjab\u2019s provincial government had put Saeed under house arrest for 10 months this year for violating anti-terrorism laws.  Writing on Twitter on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States has \u201cfoolishly\u201d handed Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid over the last 15 years while getting nothing in return and pledged to put a stop to it.

          "body": "WARSAW (Reuters) - When activists from eastern Poland traveled to Warsaw to join a far-right march, the local mayor from the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) paid for some of their travel.  The march caught the attention of the world\u2019s media because some of the 60,000 participants carried banners bearing racist and xenophobic slogans such as \u201cpure blood, clear mind\u201d and \u201cEurope will be white or uninhabited\u201d.  Stalowa Wola\u2019s PiS mayor, Lucjusz Nadberezny, does \u201cnot regret the decision to support the trip\u201d. His office said in a statement the November Independence Day march was a \u201csafe and joyous manifestation of patriotism\u201d and that people from his town did not participate in any \u201cprovocations\u201d.   A resurgence of far-right sentiment poses a dilemma for the PiS - a socially conservative group with a nationalist agenda.  Far-right voters are a threat and an opportunity. The party tapped into frustration with western liberal values, when it won the 2015 election with the biggest majority by any party since the end of communism.  In other European states where anti-establishment right-wing slogans are also increasingly resonant, several far-right groups have got a foothold in power.   But in Poland they have had little success, or desire, to compete for office. This is in large part because the PiS has tailored its message across the spectrum of right-wing voters.   The activists from Stalowa Wola said they were going to Warsaw to express their opposition to \u201can invasion of immigrants and atheism in Europe\u201d.  While several PiS officials said any racist slogans were few and unrepresentative, they also praised the march.   Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said afterwards it fueled \u201cpatriotic behavior of Poles\u201d and any displays of xenophobia were \u201cincidents\u201d that were \u201cof course, reprehensible.\u201d  His comments were a typical PiS mix of patriotism with a general condemnation of racism and anti-Semitism.  Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the powerful leader of the PiS who has no formal position in government, said in 2015 that Middle East migrants could bring parasites and diseases to Poland.  But he also said that the racist banners at the march were \u201cdisgraceful rubbish\u201d and that the \u201cPolish tradition\u201d has nothing to do with racism or anti-Semitism.  The PiS is mindful of the need to retain the support of all right-wing voters, including far-right, for elections in each of the next three years.  It is also wary of the risk of a breakaway, ultraconservative group emerging to challenge its majority in parliament.   Tadeusz Cymanski, deputy head of the PiS parliamentary caucus said it is better if far-right organizations such as ONR, which helped organize the Warsaw march, do not feel threatened by the PiS.  \u201cIt is in the interest of democracy, in the interest of our state that extreme groups, either left or right-wing, have no representation in parliament,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cAny association (of ONR with PiS) is painful and unpleasant, I reject it with shame, but I think it would be better even if I, or my faction, were associated with them rather than these forces were to gain in force.\u201d  He said the PiS is mindful that its 2015 election victory was fueled in part by the fact that several smaller groups did not cross the election threshold, earning PiS extra seats in parliament.  Another outspoken PiS member, Ryszard Czarnecki, said the party gave all right-leaning voters a sense of belonging, in contrast to the previous centrist government which was seen as \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d.  \u201cRight-wing voters have the feeling ... that we are a serious group, which has power, fulfils the right-wing agenda, so there is no need to escape towards the far right,\u201d he said.  \u201cA number of young people now prefer to vote for PiS. If (centrist) rule continued, then I think radical movements would have been stronger in Poland.\u201d  The party\u2019s more centrist electorate has stuck with it despite the move to embrace the right, partly because of generous social policies. But any stronger association with the far-right could turn those voters away, analysts say.     ONR and other far-right Polish groups such as Mlodziez Wszechpolska refuse to release membership figures but analysts say acceptance of xenophobic slogans as well as violence against Muslims is on the rise.  In a November 2016 survey by CBOS, a pollster overseen by the government, 95 percent of Poles said they did not know anyone from a far-right group. However, more than one in three said they supported far-right activities.  Hate crimes committed against Muslims have grown by more than 300 percent between 2013 and 2016, according to data from the Warsaw University\u2019s Center for Research on Prejudice.   ONR, which calls for \u201cethnic homogeneity\u201d in Poland in its official literature, says it has helped the PiS.  \u201cPiS has copied some of our rhetoric, for example referring to migrants from Muslim states,\u201d said ONR deputy chief Tomasz Dorosz. \u201cThis has assured their victory in the last election.\u201d  Poland, like Hungary, has refused to take in any of its European Union quota of refugees from Syria and elsewhere on the grounds that Muslim immigrants are a threat to national security and stability.  New PiS Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the state-run television TVP on Monday that the government\u2019s stance on migrants is not going to change \u201cin years to come\u201d.  \u201cWe will not accept refugees, migrants from the Middle East and Africa. This is our sovereign decision,\u201d Morawiecki said.  In 2016 the PiS government disbanded the Council for the Prevention of Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Intolerancee, an advisory body to the government, and a unit at the interior ministry responsible, among others, for monitoring hate crimes.  \u201cWhile the PiS governs increasingly as a far-right party, it didn\u2019t campaign as such and it wasn\u2019t elected as such,\u201d said Cas Mudde, an expert on the far-right at the University of Georgia.   But with local elections expected in late 2018, a parliamentary vote in 2019 and presidential elections in 2020, this tactic is expected to continue. Polls expect the PiS to do better in the local elections than four years ago.  \u201cKaczynski is probably disgusted (by the far right),\u201d said Konstanty Gebert, a liberal analyst with the European Council for Foreign Relations think tank.   \u201cBut it won\u2019t cloud his perspective on election interests.\u201d             Additional reporting by Pawel Sobczak, Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk, Pawel Goraj, Anna Koper in Warsaw, Matt Robinson in Belgrade and Kriszta Than in Budapest; editing by Anna Willard"

An initial draft report on boosting competition in the sector, which was leaked in February 2017, had recommended the break up of the firm that is Kenya\u2019s biggest by market value.  Business Daily reported the proposal had been dropped from a revised version of the report, which has been circulated to operators for comments.  The regulator Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), which had already said it would not break up any firm after a huge outcry following the initial draft report, was not immediately available when Reuters sought comment on the report.  The company, 35 percent owned by South African group Vodacom and 5 percent by Vodacom\u2019s major shareholder Vodafone, has 29.4 million users, 71.9 percent of Kenya\u2019s total.  It dwarfs the two other operators in the mobile market: the local subsidiary of India\u2019s Bharti Airtel and Telkom Kenya, owned by London-based Helios Partners.  The smaller operators have long argued that Safaricom enjoys a dominant position because it accounts for 90 percent of revenues in areas such as voice calls and text messages.

          "title": "Iran's leader blames enemies for deadly unrest, U.S. calls that 'nonsense'",
          "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iran\u2019s supreme leader accused the country\u2019s enemies on Tuesday of being behind days of street unrest, as the death toll from anti-government demonstrations rose to 21.  Riot police were out in force in several cities on the sixth day of protests, which spread to the northwestern city of Tabriz, according to social media posts, as security forces scrambled to contain the boldest challenge to Iran\u2019s leadership since 2009.  More than 450 protesters have been arrested in the capital in the last three days, Tehran\u2019s deputy provincial governor said, and hundreds of others were detained around the country. A judicial official said some could face the death penalty.  In the southwestern city of Ahvaz, police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators.  \u201cPolice shot tear gas and later went around asking shops on two main streets to close, to completely clear the area,\u201d a resident told Reuters by telephone.  Nine people were killed in Isfahan province during protests on Monday night, including two members of the security forces, state TV said. Six protesters were killed during an attack on a police station in the town of Qahderijan in that province. The local governor said the protesters were armed.    Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Iran\u2019s foes of fomenting the unrest, which began as protests about economic hardship and corruption but have grown into political rallies, some of which have criticized him by name.  \u201cIn recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic,\u201d he said, in his first reaction to the unrest.   He did not name the enemies but Ali\u00a0Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia were behind the riots.   \u201cSaudis will receive Iran\u2019s unexpected response and they know how serious it can be,\u201d Shamkhani was quoted by Tasnim news as saying in an interview with Beirut-based\u00a0Al Mayadeen TV.      Khamenei said on his website that he would address the nation about the events \u201cwhen the time is right\u201d.  The United States rejected the suggestion that the protests were the work of foreign powers.  \u201cWe all know that\u2019s complete nonsense,\u201d said Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.   \u201cThe demonstrations are completely spontaneous. They are virtually in every city in Iran. This is the precise picture of a long oppressed people rising up against their dictators.\u201d   Washington will seek emergency sessions at the United Nations to express support for the protesters, Haley said, adding that the international community had failed to support reformist protests in 2009 that were crushed by Tehran.  \u201cWe must not make that mistake again,\u201d she said.  The U.S. State Department urged Tehran to restore access to any social media sites that had been restricted and urged Iranian security forces to exercise restraint.  A U.S. official told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that U.S. intelligence officials think the protests have little chance of toppling the government.  Responding to President Donald Trump\u2019s daily tweets praising the protesters, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iranians enjoyed the right to peaceful protest that was denied to citizens of U.S. allies in the Middle East.  \u201cThese hard-earned rights will be protected, and infiltrators will not be allowed to sabotage them through violence and destruction,\u201d Zarif tweeted.  French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said a planned trip by Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to Tehran this week had been postponed. Macron also told Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a telephone call that Tehran must respect Iranians\u2019 right to free speech and to protest.  Russia, which is allied with Iran in its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said \u201cunacceptable\u201d external interference was destabilizing the situation in Iran, the RIA news agency reported.   Turkey, which, along with the United States and Saudi Arabia, supports Syrian rebel groups, called for restraint.  \u201cWe believe it is necessary to avoid violence and not succumb to provocations,\u201d the Turkish Foreign Ministry said, adding that it hoped foreign intervention would be avoided.      Earlier on Tuesday, Trump had tweeted: \u201cThe people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime ... The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!\u201d  The head of Tehran\u2019s Revolutionary Court, Musa Ghazanfarabadi, said protesters would be tried soon and the ringleaders could be charged with \u201cmoharebeh\u201d \u2014 an Islamic term meaning warring against God \u2014 which carries the death penalty.   Deputy Interior Minister Hossein Zolfaghari said 90 percent of the detainees were under 25, showing the younger generation\u2019s frustration at economic hardships and lack of social freedoms.  Iran is an OPEC oil producer and regional power deeply involved in Syria and Iraq as part of a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia, foreign interventions resented by many Iranians who want their leaders to pour more resources into cutting youth unemployment, which reached 29 percent last year.  President Rouhani, seen as a pragmatist who is at odds with hardliners, deflected criticisms of his economic record.  \u201cPeople on the streets do not ask for bread and water, but for more freedom,\u201d he said in televised comments on Monday, implying that the protesters were not targeting his government but the more rigid clerical establishment.        Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said both protesters and the security forces should follow the law.  \u201cEven those who are confronting the rioters should act within the framework of law,\u201d he told a news conference.  State television reported that protesters who set ablaze four mosques in villages in Savadkuh County in northern Iran on Monday had been arrested.

German drivers, companies and local governments are spurning state cash incentives to buy electric vehicles - only around 10 percent of the 600 million euros ($720 million) in such funding was used in 2016, writes Welt.

It also said Lufthansa could imagine paying 300 million euros for the business.  Separately, budget carrier Eurowings\u2019 chief Thorsten Dirks told Rheinische Post that the Lufthansa unit would focus on digitalisation in 2018.  Juniper Pharmaceuticals said its active discussions with Merck to extend the Crinone Progesterone Gel agreement were progressing, and that the expansion of this relationship remained a strategic priority for it.

          "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Beijing\u2019s crackdown on pollution has put China on track to overtake Japan this year as the world\u2019s biggest importer of natural gas, used to replace dirtier coal.  China - already the biggest importer of oil and coal - is the world\u2019s third biggest user of natural gas behind the United States and Russia, but has to import around 40 percent of its total needs as domestic production can\u2019t keep up with demand.  Data compiled from the Thomson Reuters Eikon terminal indicates China\u2019s 2017 imports of pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) will top 67 million tonnes, up by more than a quarter from a year earlier. LNG imports alone surged more than 50 percent.  The data, which includes LNG tanker arrivals to China and pipeline monthly import flow estimates, is preliminary as December figures are not yet available.  China still lags Japan, with gas annual imports of around 83.5 million tonnes, all as LNG, but its overall gas imports topped Japan\u2019s in September and again in November, government data and shipping flows show.  Analysts say the trend is set and China should top Japan for the full year in 2018.  \u201cBoth LNG and pipeline imports will continue to increase in the next few years. We expect China to overtake Japan as the world\u2019s largest gas importer in 2018,\u201d said Miaoru Huang, Asia gas and LNG senior manager at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  \u201cBut Japan will remain as the No.1 LNG importer till around 2028,\u201d she added.     China last year started to move millions of households and many industrial facilities from coal to gas as part of efforts to clean its skies, sparking an unprecedented rally in overseas import orders.  China\u2019s three biggest LNG suppliers are Australia, Qatar and Malaysia, while pipeline imports come from Central Asia and Myanmar. A pipeline connecting China to Russia is under construction.  Unlike established LNG importers which import the bulk of their cargoes under long-term contracts with fixed monthly volumes and a link to the oil market, many Chinese utilities buy LNG in the spot market when they need it at short notice, such as the current peak demand winter season.  As a result, Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have more than doubled since June to $11.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their highest since November 2014, making LNG one of 2017\u2019s strongest performing commodities.  China\u2019s surging demand already pushed it past South Korea in 2017 as the world\u2019s number 2 LNG importer.  Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin"

          "title": "Former senior Hong Kong police officer jailed for baton assault during democracy protest",
          "body": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - A former senior Hong Kong police officer was sentenced to three months jail on Wednesday for assaulting a passerby with his baton during the city\u2019s massive pro-democracy protests of late 2014.  The \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d demonstrations which occupied major roads and demanded, in vain, full democracy for the former British colony, was one of the most direct populist challenges to Beijing\u2019s Communist Party leaders since the city came under Chinese rule in 1997.  During the civil disobedience movement that ran for 79 straight days, protesters, sometimes numbering in their thousands, faced off repeatedly with the police who used batons, tear gas and pepper spray \u2014 drawing some criticism for the excessive use of force.  Retired superintendent Frankly Chu, 58, showed no obvious emotion when principal magistrate Bina Chainrai sentenced him to four months jail for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.   This was mitigated to three months given his retirement and the unlikelihood of him reoffending.   Chainrai said the sentence was necessary so that public confidence in the police force could be maintained and that the police had a \u201cduty to uphold standards\u201d.   Chu was filmed hitting a man on the neck with a baton during a protest in the Mong Kok district in 2014, targeting what some deemed to be a high-risk part of the body.   Chu, however, said during the trial that his use of force had been appropriate and that he was carrying out orders from his superiors to move protesters away from that area.    Chu\u2019s lawyer, Peter Pannu, said his client would appeal.  A Hong Kong court last February also sentenced seven policemen to two years behind bars for beating a handcuffed activist during the 2014 protests. The seven have been released on bail pending appeal.  The assaults by the seven policemen, and Chu, were captured on video and widely broadcast, triggering public outrage and tarnishing the reputation of the Hong Kong police force that has sometimes been dubbed \u201cAsia\u2019s finest\u201d.   Police support groups, however, say the officers were only maintaining public order. After the sentencing, around 30 supporters of Chu yelled: \u201cHong Kong\u2019s judiciary is unfair. Hong Kong police were insulted\u201d.  A University of Hong Kong poll that surveyed over a thousand people shows public satisfaction with the police force\u2019s performance after the Occupy protests were cleared in December 2014 plummeted to the lowest point since the handover right.  The half yearly figure has since risen from 21 percent in the first six months of 2015 to 37 percent in the last six months.

The hearing, set for Jan. 16, comes after Pershing Square and Valeant last week decided to pay $290 million to settle the lawsuit that accused them of insider trading before bidding for Allergan Plc (AGN.N) in 2014.  The lawsuit was filed on behalf of investors who sold Allergan shares in the two months before Pershing Square Capital Management and Valeant made an unsolicited $51 billion bid for Allergan.   The court has \u201csubstantial questions regarding whether the settlement amount is reasonable and fair,\u201d according to documents filed in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California.  \u201cToday\u2019s order is a mandated step in the settlement process,\u201d a Valeant spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters. \u201cWe believe the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, and we look forward to explaining our position to the Court.\u201d  Pershing Square could not be reached for comment outside regular business hours.

          "body": "Ryan Getzlaf scored a goal and added two assists Tuesday night as the Anaheim Ducks won for the fifth time in six games, posting a 5-0 shutout of the Vancouver Canucks at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Rikard Rakell added a goal and an assist, and Josh Manson was credited with three assists. Ducks goalie Ryan Miller (5-1-4) turned away all 31 shots that got to him for his second shutout of the season.  Anaheim (19-14-8) is trending upward with the return of a number of key veterans who have spent various parts of the season on injured reserve. The trade at the end of November that added center Adam Henrique from the New Jersey Devils also has given the forward lines much-needed depth and some more skill.  Henrique paid another dividend 56 seconds into this game, scoring on a bad-angle shot from the goal line as goalie Anders Nilsson failed to cover the right post. It was his ninth goal, with defenseman Hampus Lindholm drawing the first of his two assists.  Rakell made it 2-0 at 13:44 of the first period with his 15th goal, Getzlaf and Andrew Cogliano registering the helpers.  Getzlaf upped the advantage to 3-0 at 5:00 of the second period when he tipped Lindholm\u2019s point blast for just his third marker of the season. That killed what momentum Vancouver built from a solid territorial edge over the period\u2019s first 4 1/2 minutes.  The Ducks turned it into a laugher early in the third period. Antoine Vermette netted his eighth goal 20 seconds into the period, Getzlaf earning his third point of the game with the primary helper. Vermette\u2019s marker was the 5,000th in franchise history.  Derek Grant tacked on his eighth goal at 7:21, Manson bagging his final assist of the evening to finish the scoring.  Nilsson (6-6-1) stopped 15 of 19 shots before getting the hook after Vermette\u2019s goal as the Canucks (16-19-5) ate their seventh loss in eight games. Jacob Markstrom saved seven of eight shots in relief of Nilsson.  Vancouver played its last home game until Jan. 23. The Canucks play seven straight on the road with their mandatory five-day bye tossed in for good measure.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "Marc-Andre Fleury made 29 saves and recorded his 46th career shutout as the red-hot Vegas Golden Knights blanked the Nashville Predators 3-0 on Tuesday night at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.  It was the eighth straight win for the Western Conference-leading Golden Knights, matching the longest win streak in the NHL this year by the Los Angeles Kings (8-0-0 from Nov. 25-Dec. 9). It also was the 13th consecutive game in which Vegas (27-9-2) garnered a point, as the Golden Knights are 12-0-1 over that stretch.  Reilly Smith, Shea Theodore and Jonathan Marchessault scored goals and Alex Tuch had two assists for the Golden Knights, who haven\u2019t lost a game in regulation since a 7-4 defeat at Winnipeg on Dec. 1.  Fluery picked up his second shutout in three games, and he has yielded just six goals in his past five games.  Pekka Rinne stopped 28 shots for Nashville (23-11-5). The Predators lost for the fifth time in seven games and were shut out for just the second time this season.  Fleury kept the Golden Knights in the game early, especially at the start of the second period when Nashville fired the first 11 shots on goal over an eight-minute span.  Vegas took a 1-0 lead on Smith\u2019s power-play goal at 12:10 of the middle period. Smith beat Rinne to the short side, sliding the puck into the crease and off Rinne\u2019s back pad as the goalie was leaning toward Tuch stationed in front of the net. It was Smith\u2019s 10th goal of the season.  Theodore made it 2-0 just 1:31 later with his fourth goal of the season, blasting a shot from the right point that hit inside Rinne\u2019s right pad, then spun between the goalie\u2019s legs and slowly slid into the net.  The Predators, taking advantage of a David Perron delay-of-game penalty for shooting the puck over the glass, had a six-on-four advantage for 50 seconds but never managed a serious threat as Vegas killed its 14th consecutive penalty.  Marchessault added an empty-net goal with 2:23 remaining after Nashville pulled Rinne with 4:20 left.  Vegas improved to 17-2-1 at T-Mobile Arena, the most home wins by any team in the NHL this season.  \u2014Field Level Media"

          "body": "* Optimism on global growth boosts risk trades, dents bonds  * Asia shares ex-Japan approach record top from 2007  * Euro near last year\u2019s high against broadly weaker dollar  By Wayne Cole  SYDNEY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Asian stocks struck a range of new peaks on Wednesday as risk appetites were whetted by a feast of upbeat manufacturing surveys that confirmed a synchronised upturn in the world economy was well under way.  Activity was especially strong in Europe, lifting bond yields there and driving the euro to within a whisker of its highest in three years against a beleaguered U.S. dollar.  Investors also piled into emerging market trades, delivering a record peak for Philippine stocks, a 24-year top for Thailand and a decade-high for Hong Kong.  MSCI\u2019s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4 percent, having jumped 1.4 percent on Tuesday in its best performance since last March.  At 579.46 the index is creeping ever closer to the all-time peak of 591.50 reached in late 2007.  Chinese blue chips gained for the fourth session running, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei was closed for holidays.  Wall Street started the new year as it ended the old, scoring another set of record closing peaks. The Dow rose 0.42 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.83 percent and the Nasdaq 1.5 percent.  The gains in riskier assets came as industry surveys from India to Germany to Canada showed quickening activity.  \u201cThe breadth of the recovery is extraordinary,\u201d said Deutsche Bank macro strategist Alan Ruskin, noting that of 31 countries covered, only three failed to show growth while all the largest manufacturing sectors improved.  \u201cThe global economy and risky assets are now solidly into a virtuous cycle, whereby growth is propelling risky assets like equities higher, that are then supporting growth,\u201d he added.  \u201cThis is not a global economy in need of the extraordinary emergency style policies pursued by the likes of the ECB and Bank of Japan.\u201d  Indeed, with euro zone factories expanding at their fastest pace in more than two decades, speculation is rampant that the European Central Bank will start to wind down its asset buying programme later this year.  As a result, yields on 10-year German paper climbed 4 basis points to a two-month top at 0.467 percent, which in turn pushed up rates across the European periphery.  Spanish yields, for instance, have risen 16 basis points in just three sessions to reach 1.616 percent.  The prospect that other major central banks could play catch up with the Federal Reserve on tightening undermined the dollar, which sank to a three-month trough against its peers.  The euro stretched as far as a four-month top of $1.2082 , adding to its 2017 gains of 14 percent. It was last at $1.2050 and bulls were eyeing the September peak of $1.2092, a break of which would return to ground last trod in early 2015.  The single currency has already reached a two-year high on the yen at 135.64, while the dollar lagged far behind at 112.32 yen.  The weakness of the dollar has been a positive for commodities priced in the currency.  Spot gold reached its highest since mid-September at $1,321.33, before edging back to $1,313.48 per ounce.  Oil prices hit their highest since mid-2015, only to stall when major pipelines in Libya and the UK restarted and U.S production soared to the strongest in more than four decades.  Brent crude futures were trading 3 cents lower at $66.54 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures nudged up 1 cent to $60.38 a barrel.  Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore"

          "body": "(The following statement was released by the rating agency) BANGKOK, January 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings (Thailand) has today assigned Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited's (BAY; AAA(tha)/Stable) upcoming issue of senior unsecured bonds a National Long-Term Rating of 'AAA(tha)'. The bonds will have a tenor of up to three years and the total issue size will be up to THB15 billion. Proceeds of the issue will be used for refinancing and/or general corporate purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS The bonds are rated at the same level as BAY's National Long-Term Rating as they represent the unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the bank. BAY's National Long-Term Rating is driven by Fitch's view that its parent, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (BTMU; A/Stable), would provide extraordinary support if needed. BTMU controls BAY via its 76.9% shareholding and BAY is a key part of the parent's strategy for south-east Asia. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating on the bonds is sensitive to any changes in BAY's National Long-Term Rating. The National Long-Term Rating of BAY is at the top end of the scale and no upside is possible. A downgrade of the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating of BTMU could lead to negative rating action on BAY's National Long-Term Rating. BAY's National Long-Term Rating could also be hurt if BTMU shows a reduced propensity to support its Thai subsidiary - which may, for example, be seen via a significantly reduced shareholding, or a weakening in integration and linkages with the parent. However, Fitch views this as unlikely in the medium term.

The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.2048. The currency hit a four-month high of $1.2081 on Tuesday, marking a gain of roughly 3 percent from a mid-December trough and bringing it close to a September high of $1.2092, the currency\u2019s highest level since early 2015.  It was boosted by data showing euro zone manufacturers ended 2017 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace in more than two decades as rising demand suggested they will start the new year on a high.  The euro was also supported by expectations for a shift in ECB monetary policy this year.  The ECB board member in charge of the central bank\u2019s market operations, Benoit Coeure, said at the weekend that he saw a \u201creasonable chance\u201d bond purchases would not be extended beyond September.  ECB rate-setter Ewald Nowotny told a German newspaper in an interview that the ECB may end its stimulus programme this year if the euro zone economy continued to grow strongly.  \u201cIt\u2019s this monetary policy normalisation everywhere that\u2019s playing catch-up to the Fed, and that\u2019s why the dollar is weak,\u201d said Heng Koon How, head of market strategy for United Overseas Bank in Singapore.  The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies held steady at 91.902, having pulled up from Tuesday\u2019s 3-1/2 month low of 91.751.  Later on Wednesday, investors will turn their attention to the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy meeting, when it raised interest rates for the third time in 2017.  Further cues are likely from U.S. economic data this week, including jobs figures on Friday.  \u201cOne key is whether the Fed minutes and U.S. jobs data will prompt the U.S. 10-year bond yield to clearly rise above 2.5 percent,\u201d said Teppei Ino, an analyst for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Singapore, which would boost the dollar.  The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was 2.465 percent at the close of U.S. trade on Tuesday, below a nine-month high of 2.504 percent on Dec. 21.  Commodity-linked currencies took a breather from a rally spurred in recent weeks by higher metal and oil prices.  The Canadian dollar last stood at C$1.2521 per U.S. dollar. It briefly rose to C$1.2500 early on Wednesday, matching Tuesday\u2019s peak and its highest level since Oct. 20. (Reporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Neil Fullick)"
